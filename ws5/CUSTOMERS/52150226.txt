His best yet	Brad Thor has continued to amaze me with his wonderful International thrillers. Filled with intrigue and suspense that puts him at the top of my 'must read' list. His well researched novels, this time around, includes Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, some history of bio-chemical warfare, the divide between Muslims two major groups and much more. With all this, you get a great adventure to boot. Doesn't get much better than this for great entertainment.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.	2005-10-12
4 1/2 stars	This was a fun and wild ride considering it's the authors first outing. While reading parts of it I was visualizing the protagonist as a cinematic 007, as well as a Ludlum/Clancy type rogue spy. A good combination. This looks to be the first in a series featuring Cooper and Laramie. I didn't see the great depth to the characters as other reveiwers did, and would have liked to learn a little more about them. Still good entertainment.<br /><br />\\"Live slow, Mon.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-10-04
A great complex thriller	I thought this was a highly entertaining novel. The way Tanenbaum entertwined 2 or 3 major plots is the sign of a skilled author, and I thought he did a fantastic job. International terrorism, rascism, courtroom drama, family drama, all of this and more, make for a compelling and enthralling story with a very high 'entertainment value'. I thought this to be one of his best. I guess books are like movies as far as taste goes. Some will love it and some won't.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-29
4 1/2 stars	Douglas Preston has not yet disappointed me with any of his novels, this one included. I think most of his readers will really enjoy this novel as well. It's a fast and engrossing tale with plenty of adventure, just don't take it too seriously. Have fun and enjoy it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-26
Fascinating	The action and suspense in Lewis Perdue's latest revolves around some powerful figures who want to dope Americas military soldiers with an new drug called Xantaeus. It \\"robs a soldier of free will without their knowledge, overides their sense of compassion and neutralizes the fear of injury\\".<br /><br />The well researched sciences (psychological, biological, cosmological, etc) involved in the writing of this novel made it both highly entertaining and educational.<br /><br />A fascinating thriller well worth your time.<br /><br />From inside: \\"The human mind is a strange amalgam of deep-seated, foundational Darwinian impulses and rational centers of higher control. The first govern basic animal survival and land people in prison when the second doesn't take control.\\"<br /><br />\\"Our quest for the truth begins with three important steps:<br /><br />\\"One, free will derives from consciousness. Two, consciousness is our perception of reality. Three, reality is weird.\\"	2005-09-22
4 1/2 stars	Patrick Larkin does a wonderful job carrying on Ludlum's namesake with another action packed international thriller. I very much enjoyed this novel and I think Larkin will soon be out on his own, without the need for Ludlums' namesake. Though, as common sense dictates, without the name Ludlum on the title, sales would not be near as high. I agree with one reviewer in regard to the heroes surviving as long as they do, when the killers talk instead of shoot. Oh well, its good escapist fiction either way.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-09-20
Great thriller	This is an out and out good thriller. Chases, suspense, international intrigue, cat and mouse, red herrings, it's got it all. A well written fantastic thriller that puts Jeff Abbott at one of the top spots on my 'must read' list.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-15
4 1/2 stars	I'll agree that this is one of David Morrell's better novels. He packs quite a bit of suspense and action into these pages and the adrenaline never seems to let up. I must admit though, at times, I couldn't quite clearly visualize the layout of the hotel and its many secret areas/stairwells. You could say that sometimes I got a little lost. Oh well, it was still great entertainment.<br /><br />Recommended	2005-09-13
His Best	I must say that this is one of my favorite Keith Ablow novels to date. Though he brings in the common villian who is brainwashed by his religious beliefs, he puts a unique spin on it. What also caught my interest was the way Ablow integrated the secret society of the Skull and Bones, which is the oldest and most prestigious of Yales 7 secret societies, that was established in 1832. President Bush is rumored to be a member among other powerful figures.<br /><br />This was a highly entertaining and fascinating novel. The cliched 'hard to put down' is suitable for this novel.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-09
Great adventure	When it comes to all out entertainment Clive Cussler is hard to beat. He's written another adrenaline pounding adventure that will please all his fans. Combining Indy Jones and 007 genres, you'll be in for the adventure of the summer. The way Cussler mixes science and adventure makes this one of my favorite summer books so far.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-05
4 1/2 stars	In this sequel, Christopher Whitcomb comes through with another well written thriller that's perfect for a summer read. A fast-paced wildly plotted thriller sure to please fans of his previous novel 'Black'. I Look forward to more in this series.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-08-26
Average effort	I've read all of Christopher Reich's books and have enjoyed them all. He generally writes great financial thrillers and is one of my favorite authors. This latest effort is not his best and is just an average thriller. I liked the pacing but the 'conspiracy' seemed to be a little over the top and took some of the believability out of the story. Overall, though, it still held my attention and was entertaining.<br /><br />Recommended	2005-08-18
3 1/2 stars	The group of writers assembled in this novel would seem more believable if he put them on the bus directly form the insane asylum. This would make there behavior more on track.<br /><br /> As mentioned by other reviewers the characters lack depth.<br /><br /> Some of the short stories were very original and entertaining and the some of the images it created were quite qraphic. I must admit I was entertained by quite a few of these shorties. The oddity of the characters and there impulses, is what I couldn't quite muster.	2005-08-08
4 1/2 Stars	I think Kyle Mills is at the top of his game with this novel. A suspenseful thriller laced with just the right amount of humor. I loved his earlier Beamon novels and this thriller rates right up there with them. Keep up the good work.<br /><br />From inside:\\"The media's no different than the government, Elise. Everyone has the impression that America is becoming the most danerous place in the world, but it isn't. In some ways, it's actually getting safer. But those twenty-four-hour news stations have to keep people glued to their sets so they can sell Pampers or SUV's or whatever. People who think they're in danger don't channel surf.\\"<br /><br />\\"Anyone who would give up liberty for safety deserves neither\\" (Ben Franklin)<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-30
One  Shot	Lee Child has written another outstanding Reacher novel. It's well written and will hold your attention to the very end. Lee Child and his Reacher series is one of my favorites. It's high entertainment quotient and great story line engrosses the reader. Lee Child is at his peak and I think he's going to stay there for some time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-26
Lifeguard	As is typical for a Patterson/co-author novel, it will move at a fast pace and you'll most likely get it read in a couple days. The novel is both satisfying and quite entertaining. As mentioned by others, this novel is on par with his others and should leave most Patterson fans happy and looking forward to his next (which I'm sure is should be out in a month or so).	2005-07-21
See storylines above	Weinberger and Schweizer have put together a novel that is definitely fast and highly entertaining, with enough thrills to please most thriller fans. The only slight drawback was that the plot seemed just a little farfetched, though it was fun to read.<br /><br />Recommended for the thrills	2005-07-19
Average Buffa	D.W. Buffa does write an entertaining novel, bringing a lot of things to light, such as the publics reliance on television journalism to help them form an opinion. Antonelli is a memorable character that's very likeable and who seems to have a lot of common sense. (I liked his views on capital punishment).<br /><br />The story seemed a little rushed and could have used a little more detail in places. Once again the book flap gave away to much information telling you what was going to happen, practically to the halfway point.	2005-07-14
4 3/4 stars	In his second novel, Jack Kerley takes you into the world of serial killers, as well as collectors of serial killer memorabilia.<br /><br />With the duo of Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus, Kerley has hit on something that works. This novel is as good or better than his first and proves he's got what it takes to give you a wickedly good story. With suspense, mystery, and comic relief, you're in for a highly entertaining read.<br /><br />I look forward to his next effort, hoping it includes the duo of Ryder and Nautilus.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-13
4 1/2 stars	With Jeffrey Deaver you can expect an engrossing and suspenseful story. He delivers again. The way he weaves through the storyline and connects the dots is a talent few authors have. A very satisfying novel that never lets up.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-09
The Black Angel	This is a well researched thriller typical of John Connolly that should please his many fans. With great depth to his characters and a highly detailed plot (maybe too detailed, as one reviewer wrote), Connolly takes you on trip that will keep you intrigued, with both fantasy and fact.	2005-07-03
Great reading	I gotta say that I'm always looking forward to a Preston & Child novel. What you basically get is non-stop suspense, original plotting, and a cast of characters that you'll not soon forget. This was a fascinating read and sure too please all Preston & Child fans. Keep up the good work and I look forward your next offering in this series.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-30
No Dan Brown	Yes it's been highly researched, and as the author says, he likes to both educate and entertain. The timing is also good since, just recently, a pope has been anointed. But if your looking for an action packed suspenseful thriller in the vein of Dan Brown, don't expect this one to deliver. It was well written but came off as a little dry to me. One of the things you will get though, is an intellectual thriller that takes a close look at the Vatican and it's possible conflicts within its ranks.<br /><br />From inside: \\"...four basic rules of Vatican survival. Rule one-never contemplate an original thought. Rule two--if for some reason an idea occurs, don't voice it. Rule three--absolutely never set a thought to paper. And rule four--under no circumstance sign anything you foolishly decided to write.	2005-06-22
4 1/2 stars	The witty Andy Carpenter returns in a very satisfying and fun to read novel. You'll get the 'whodunnit' story as well as the courtroom drama scenes. A fun and entertaining way to spend some of your summers hours.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-06-19
Quick and enjoyable	See storyline above.<br /><br />This was the typical Kinkster novel. With alot of his usual characters and their quirks, the hilarity ensues the way you come to expect. It's a quick read and no time is wasted. For some reason I don't think this is the end.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-06-15
Predictable but entertaining	I was apprehensive before reading this because of his recent novels, which were rather lackluster, but as it turns out this one wasn't so bad. Yes, it was definitely predictable. It was also a little too long (wordy?).<br /><br />It wasn't a struggle to get through because it was still fairly good entertainment.	2005-06-03
4 1/2 stars	I don't think this is his best work but Dean Koontz rarely disappoints me, as I did enjoy this novel. His stories generally move fast and he always has some unique characters (one studies the art of Aruspicy. \\"\A*rus\\"pi*cy\, n. [L. aruspicium, haruspicium.] Prognostication by inspection of the entrails of victims slain sacrifice.\\")<br /><br />A satisfying and quick read that should keep most Koontz fans happy.<br /><br />Recommended	2005-06-03
His best	I think this is one of Tim Green's best novels. A well written and very engrossing story that kept me satisfied to the very end. Whether it's similar to 'Count of Monte Cristo', or not, doesn't matter to me because I haven't read that novel. What matters to me is the entertainment level while reading, and Green's novel provides more than enough. Keep up the good work Tim, I'll be waiting for your next one.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-05-28
4 1/2 stars	Elmore Leonard has written many a novel in a variety of settings. This one came as somewhat a surprise. 1930's of Oklahoma. Prohibition, gangsters, bank-robbers. What Leonard has done is write a novel that will bring you back and relive life in this era. An entertaining novel that you'll likely read through in a day or two. Great characters and a good plot that will please most Elmore Leonard fans.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-05-25
Fantastic!	This is, without a doubt, Rollins' best novel to date. A fascinating and fantastic adventure that is well researched as well as being filled with action and chilling escapes. If you like riddles and mysteries of the past, it's also included. Great entertainment from one of my favorite 'must read' authors.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-21
4th of July	Though the Womens Murder Club doesn't really come into play this time around (it's all Lindsey Boxer basically), it's still a good Patterson novel. The quick writing style and the gripping plot makes this one easy to read in a day or two. Well written with quite a few surprises.<br /><br />A good read.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-05-17
4 1/2 stars	Out of jail after a conviction for manslaughter (he was just trying to stop a fight), Matt Hunter suddenly finds himself suspected of multiple murders.<br /><br />As always, Harlan Coben provides great entertainment in his latest thriller. A fast moving, twisting thriller I was very satisfied reading.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-07
4 1/2 stars	With a great depth to the characters and a writing style that impresses, Mo Hayder has written a dark and sometime graphic novel that should impress all her fans.<br /><br />An overall good story taking place in both 90's Tokyo and Nanking of '37.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-04-28
Good entertainment	Randy Wayne White hits another home run in this latest Doc Ford thriller. I read through this novel fairly quick and enjoyed the whole thing. It's cast of notable characters (especially Tomlinson) and it's eco-thriller subject matter made this one a joy to read.<br /><br />From inside: \\"In any conflict, the boundaries of behavior are defined by those who value morality least...\\"<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-04-16
4 1/2 stars	I think this is one of Frey's best. I thought it was well written and the storyline definitely intrigued me. You'll get a good idea of how business works from the top.<br /><br />From inside: \\"Allies. As vital in business as in war. Because business is war.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-14
Great reading	Joseph Finder's fans will love this one. I also think it's his best to date. The story moves fast and pulls you in at the same time. A well written suspenseful thriller well worth your time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-09
Excellent	See storyline above.<br /><br />I thought this was a fantastic thriller. There is suspense and action to please all thriller fans. Doherty creates a relentless story with two very likeable protagonists. In fact I hope he somehow writes a series featuring 'The Cellar'.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-07
4 1/2 stars	Not quite as good as his previous novel but still well worth reading. It's a well written emotional thriller. The adventure takes you to Columbia and its jungles. The characters and storyline seem real and the author also gives you an idea why the country is split between warring factions. To paraphrase: \\"On the left is the FARC, and on the right is USDF, with the government trying to ineffectually referee\\".<br /><br />Recommended	2005-04-06
Entertaining	I found this novel to be entertaining. It's a nice change that John J. Nance doesn't write yet another air disaster but keeps it on the ground instead. Nance is a very skilled writer with a narrative that puts you in the middle of the story. A fast and sometimes emotional story that kept me entertained.<br /><br />Recommended	2005-04-05
4 1/2 stars	Phillip Margolin is another one of those authors that never seems to disappoint me. He's written another intriguing novel with action and suspense you've come to expect. The characters, the plot, and the action, will keep you highly entertained. A solid and well rounded thriller written for those who like to escape.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-03-29
Missing Persons	Stephen White is one of those authors that when you see his name you know you're in for a special treat. His Allen Gregory series is at the top of his game in this latest thriller/mystery. Along with his writing style and 'draw you in' story line, you get a satisfying and rousting story with plenty of his usual ethical conundrums. Keep it up.<br /><br />Recommended for mystery and thriller readers and all Stephen White fans.	2005-03-24
4 1/2 stars	Daniel Silva's talent as a writer shines in this latest Gabriel Allon thriller. Along with the adventure and thrills you'll get a lesson in Arab/Israili conflicts both past and present.<br /><br />A joy to read. It should broaden Silvas fan base as well as strengthen the bond with his current fans.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-03-20
4 1/2 stars	Robert Crais writes yet another great Elvis Cole thriller that is sure to draw you in from beginning to end.<br /><br />Crais has the ability to give his characters life which gives his stories that extra power. Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-03-16
4 12/ stars	Besides his ability to write great thrillers, one of Brian Haigs best assets is his wise-cracking character Sean Drummond. Drummond is back in one of Haigs best thrillers so far. The pace is fast and the plot is engrossing. Brian Haig is fast becoming one of my favorite thriller writers and with four books under his belt I believe he's found his niche.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2005-03-04
Typical Patterson	I know when I pick up a Patterson novel it will be a quick and thrilling ride. This was no exception. With few wasted words and a good plot, Patterson and Roughan have come together and created an entertaining story which you'll most likely get through in a day or two.<br /><br />Easy to read and enjoy.<br /><br />Recommended	2005-03-04
Great entertainment	I for one loved this novel.<br /><br />You get suspense, science, theories, and action all rolled into a truly unique and exciting novel. An excellent first effort by Fawer. Here's hoping this is a sign of things to come.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-02-24
4 1/2  stars	This is the fourth in a series featuring Carroll Monks and it's close to being one of the best. You know the storyline by now featuring cults, brainwashing, and the evil protagonist known as Freeboot.<br /><br />A well told and fast-paced story that should please all the fans that have read McMahon's previous novels.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-02-18
Hilarious	Kudos To Tim Dorsey for another rip-roaring, laugh out loud story. He provides excellent entertainment well worth the price. The way he puts a story together with its little subplots is impressive. He is, without a doubt, one of the funniest writers out there.<br /><br />Tim Dorsey will always be on my 'must read' list.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes to laugh.	2005-02-10
4 1/2 stars	In a departure from his Ben Kincaid series William Bernhardt spins a tale about a psychotic serial killer loose in Vegas.<br /><br />I thought it was riveting and suspenseful. It moved at a good pace. The characters had depth enough that you could understand how they felt.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel and am pleased that Bernhardt decided to go with something a little different.<br /><br /> Recommended	2005-02-05
The Broker	By the title you would think your getting another legal thriller--I know, thriller's not really the suitable term for many of his previous novels--but this time Grisham has written, what I think, is a pretty darn good espionage/spy thriller. It does move along at a gradual pace yet still draws you into the story and characters. You'll certainly learn quite a bit about Bologna, Italy and the surrounding area (almost too much?).<br /><br />I wonder if Grisham might write another Joel Blackman novel? I kind of hope so.<br /><br />Recommended	2005-01-27
My first Griffin	This is the first W.E.B. Griffin book I've read. I have picked up some of his previous novels but never finished one. He definitely gets into detail when it comes to the military and its machinery. His solid story telling and the topical subject of terrorism make this a fairly entertaining novel that I see pleases most of his fans.<br /><br /> I'm sure his military knowledge is much better than his knowledge of air traffic control 'phraseology', which really made me laugh (being an ATC). Talk to a controller next time for help in this.<br /><br />I'll probably continue reading this series.	2005-01-15
Sacred Stone	I do think this is a little better than the previous Craig Dirgo novel. The whole story had great potential in the right hands, but as Dirgo has shown and written, it can also be a bit entangled.<br /><br /> The novel itself moved fast and did provide me with a few hours of entertainment, just not the entertainment I'm used to with the Cussler name.	2005-01-09
3 1/2 stars	James Patterson doesn't like to waste words when he writes. The lack of depth is proof of that. And because of that this novel was quickly read and absorbed. An international thriller in which appears both the Weasel (whose quick demise also surprised me) and the Wolf.<br /><br /> It was entertaining enough to read--my library copy--but, as most people, I was disappointed with the overall depth and quickness, as well as the ending.	2005-01-05
Satisfying	In this somewhat fast-paced novel, Demille brings back John Corey, a wise-cracking character from a couple previous novels. When John Corey takes lead you generally get a satisfying story. This one was both entertaining and well researched (It'll also get you thinking).<br /><br />A fine novel that should please all Demille fans.<br /><br />Recommended	2004-12-30
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br /><br />From the intense beginning throughout, Koontz has written what I see as a very satisfying and engrossing novel.<br /><br />From the witty dialogue to his outstanding writing style (sometimes a bit wordy, but 'good wordy', if you know what I mean), He satisfies and keeps you guessing at the same time.<br /><br /> This is one of his best recent novels.<br /><br />From inside the covers:<br /><br />\\"...revenge and justice are twin braids in a line as thin as the high wire that an aerialist must walk, and if you can't keep your balance, then you are doomed--and damned--regardless of whether you fall to the left or to the right of the line. A restrained response to evil is not moral, but neither is excessive violence.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-12-21
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br /><br />This is your typical Cussler novel. It has adventure on sea and land. It has narrow escapes and stunning visuals. It has international intrigue and a diabolical mad-man you love to hate. As I said, typical Cussler, providing all the adventure and escape you've come to expect.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2004-12-15
Entertaining	Conor O'Neil, security director of a large Fifth Avenue store witnesses a fatal robbery for which he is wrongfully arrested. Going on the run, he discovers the loot is to fund something unthinkable yet all too possible. His efforts to avert worldwide disaster take him on a terrifying journey.<br /><br />This story does have a high entertainment value. The pace is fast and the visuals sometimes graphic. If you can swallow the idea about the hypnosis (so quick and simple), you'll love it, if not, just enjoy the ride.	2004-12-09
A little of for Follett	See book summary above.<br /><br />I did enjoy this novel though I was thinking I'd get more of a<br /><br />scientific thriller than a crime thriller.<br /><br />The virus plot sort of takes a back seat to the rest of the story which evolves around Stanley Oxenfords family problems and Toni Gallo's love interests. There is still enough action and suspense to please most fans.<br /><br /> I thought it was well written, just not your typical Ken Follett novel.	2004-12-02
3 1/2 stars	See summary above.<br /><br />Though the whole storyline seemed quite implausible (e.g. the expenditure and time, as well as the blatant presence of the CIA, required to 'recruit' Scott Russell), it was quite entertaining. As another reviewer hinted at, once you realize that it's not realistic you'll enjoy the story more.<br /><br /> I feel the story itself had a lot of potential, but the authors writing style just didn't quite get it.<br /><br />I will probably read the follow up novel just to see what happens to Scott and Laura and to see if there is a change in the writing.	2004-11-30
4 1/2 stars	The wise-cracking Sean King and the beautiful Michelle Maxwell have there hands full chasing a copycat killer whose body count rises quite rapidly.<br /><br />This is not the typical Baldacci because this time around he writes an intricately plotted mystery/procedural. I think most fans of the mystery genre will enjoy this one even though it does seem a bit overdone. A satisfying read with just enough suspense and mystery to captivate most readers.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-11-19
Par	This is my first experience with this author. With his background there is no doubt he has some rather intimate knowledge about what he writes.<br /><br />I found the novel to be fast as well as furious. The writing is what I had a small problem with. It seemed quick and abbreviated with not a great deal of depth. There was certainly no wasted words in this book.<br /><br /> A quick and satisfying read just the same.	2004-11-17
4 1/2 stars	See synopsis above.<br /><br />Its seems the Nano-tech thriller is becoming quite popular and Patrick Larkin does a great job with this one. ('Nano' by John Robert Marlow was also a good nanotech thriller).<br /><br />I thought it was an exciting read and it kept me enthralled to the end. I don't seem to remember any slow spots in the whole novel. Good from beginning to end.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-11-12
4 stars	See storyline above.<br /><br />Based on real events, Klavan's latest novel with Weiss and Bishop is sure to satisfy his fans. A suspenseful thriller with some hard characters.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-11-04
Great entertainment	Once again, one of my favorite authors comes through with another exciting addition to the 'Repairman Jack' series. Of course one can expect nothing less than this from F. Paul Wilson. The story pulls you in like few can.<br /><br />The ultimate thrill is the justice meted out by The Repairman on those most deserving. He not only does one job, he does several at a time, so the thrills are spread throughout the novel.<br /><br />A great story (series), great characters, and enough thrills to please all readers of suspense--both natural and supernatural.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-11-04
3 1/2 stars	I'm a big fan of George Carlin and subscribe to many of his views but I think this time around his book was mostly filler and not a lot of quality stuff. I actually got tired a reading the euphemism chapters but I endured.<br /><br />Yes it does have a few gems interspersed with the filler. Those gems almost made it worth it.<br /><br />Recommend the library copy.	2004-10-28
4 1/2 stars	John Case has done a fine job in this latest emotional thriller about a man's relentless pursuit for his abducted children.<br /><br />He'll keep you guessing as the father persues clue after clue taking him from N'Orleans to Vegas to California and points in between. Along the way you'll be educated on things like Voodoo practices and some history about magic and its relation to religion and the supernatural. Small problem with the ending but overall a fine effort.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-10-28
3 1/2 stars	I agree that the believability factor is not really here, especially as far as the weather machine and the escapes are concerned, but I did enjoy this novel--much like I would enjoy a burger over steak sometimes--it's simple to read with not a lot of added verbiage. It was fun entertainment.	2004-10-20
4 1/2 stars	I've always liked Christopher Buckley's books and this one is no exception. One of the main themes of the book is the Mideast's treatment of there women. The story mixes both satire and suspense while writing about a subject that can raise numerous sensibilities.<br /><br /> Buckley's done a fine job with this intelligent satire. The characters, as well as the originality, made this book well worth the time.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-10-16
Good sci-fi	A slick and fast paced novel. Though this novel is strictly science fiction there are some interesting facts about nano-technology and its future applications. A captivating novel not to be taken too seriously (considering the author's doomsday outlook). Great entertainment.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-10-09
4 1/2 stars	If you like tales of lost cities in the jungle as well as stories that involve the supernatural, I think you will enjoy this latest effort by Jeff Long. Stylishly written with some good visuals (...a hailstorm of frogs) and a brisk pace.<br /><br />It was a quick and satisfying novel.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-10-04
4 1/2 stars	See story summary above.<br /><br />An average effort by Ethan Black this time around. Though it has action as well as an emotional edge, this isn't the Conrad Voort of old (as one reviewer mentioned). It is a good story and it will keep you intrigued, so I would still recommend it for Ethan Black fans.	2004-09-30
Great read	See book description above.<br /><br />Another winner.<br /><br />Hurwitz has created yet another truly satisfying novel, from beginning to end. His great characters (one you'll just love to hate) and plotting will keep you glued to the pages.<br /><br />Mind-control technique is a very interesting subject in which Hurwitz did a fine job of researching.<br /><br />\\"...the human willingness to surrender critical thought was staggering\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-09-27
4 1/2 stars	A well rounded thriller from start to finish. Robinson's latest novel should make his fans happy as well as create new ones. One of his best.<br /><br />Recommended for thriller readers.	2004-09-21
Whirlwind	See storyline above.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent thriller. Escapist fiction at its finest. Both compelling and unputdownable. I, for one, enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />One thing that Gardner could have done was more research in the procedures and phraseology of Air Traffic Control.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-09-21
Hear No Evil	See book summary above.<br /><br />Well I certainly enjoyed reading this one.<br /><br />I like Grippando's writing style. He makes it hard to stop reading. I was engrossed from start to finish.<br /><br />A good story and a great read.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.	2004-09-12
Bravo!	See storyline above.<br /><br />A visually stunning, fast-paced adventure, that will keep Rollins fans happy and hopefully garner some new ones. I love the science as well as the creativity. Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-09-06
3 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br /><br />The novel is fast to read as well as action packed. The brevity of the narration and the 'clipped action'(PW's words) seems to be a more and more common writing style for this author. I don't like it. I'd say it's aimed more towards a younger reader than serious thriller readers.	2004-09-06
Loved it	See storyline above (Booklist's).<br /><br />I was not at all disappointed in Folsom's latest international thriller.<br /><br />The action, as well as the depth, will draw you in from page one. A memorable and truly entertaining novel fans of Allan Folsom have come to expect.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-26
Satisfactory	See book description above.<br /><br />I think Lustbader has done a satisfactory job in taking over the Bourne saga. His writing style is a little different than Ludlums (not quite as good), but he writes a fairly good thriller.<br /><br /> He brings us the nonstop action and endless fights (which Bourne seems to be immune to) as well as international intrigue placing you anywhere from Grozny to Iceland to Paris.<br /><br />I think the poor taste in book covers will probably hurt sales. I say this because, while reading this book, three different people assummed it was the same as the the current Bourne movie (I, for one, can't blame them).<br /><br />Recommended	2004-08-19
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br /><br />Classic Hiaasen. He gives you an odd blend of characters and puts them into an original story that is both humorous and thrilling to read. I think Hiaasen is at his peek and this one is sure to please all his fans.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-07
Great	See storyline above.<br /><br />I have to say that this is one of my favorite Deaver novels. A superbly written thriller that will make you feel like you're actually in Berlin as Hitler comes to power before the war. The tension is high and the action is fast.<br /><br /> I think that maybe Paul Schumann might make another appearance in the future, and I certainly welcome that.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2004-08-01
Excellent	See storyline above.<br /><br />A well rounded and extremely entertaining novel which you come to expect from Clive Cussler. You get action on the high seas as well as on land and ice.<br /><br />Kidnapped scientists and an elixir based on ocean enzymes from the Lost City are just some of the problems Kurt Austin faces. Its seems that Kurt Austin will be Cusslers main protagonist now that Dirk Pitt is the head of NUMA. I have no problem with that.<br /><br />Excellent entertainment thats fast, furious and fun.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-07-27
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br /><br />Katzenbach has come through again. With a unique blend of characters and a writing style sure to pull you in, this thriller will keep all his fans satisfied.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-07-20
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />This came over as a disappointment. This somewhat short novel lacked believability as well as having characters I didn't much care for. Hopefully Greg Bear's next effort will be more like his previous novels.	2004-07-12
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Carsten Stroud, one of my favorite spy thriller writers, delivers yet another exciting adventure involving both politics and terrorism. This novel will keep you on the edge. The story and writing style, both solid, will keep thriller fans happy. The only bad thing I noticed was the editing. If there are three or four mistakes I usually won't mention it, but there are at least twice this many.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-07-09
The Enemy	See storyline above.<br />As mentioned elsewhere this is a compelling and very satisfying thriller that won't disappoint Lee Child fans. The story has some interesting twists along with a narrative that will keep you glued to the pages.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-07-03
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />I think D. W. Buffa is now at the top of the pile when it comes to legal thrillers. In 'Breach of Trust' he's written a novel that takes you through the corridors of D.C. while providing thought provoking political commentary. Some of his characters are somewhat long winded--what do you expect for politicians--but make some interesting points. The pace is not always fast but the story will definitely pull you in with its great depth.<br />With its mystery and courtroom scenes, Buffa is going places Grisham hasn't even thought about.<br />Keep it up.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-23
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />As a first novel I was very impressed. There is suspense and mystery throughout. I was immersed from beginning to end. Great characters and descriptive plotting. This novel should create a nice fan base for Kerley and I certainly look forward to his next.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-16
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />This newcomer to the spy-thriller is a welcome addition.<br />Having the the background in this field, Whitcomb has written a knowledgable and fast-paced novel. It's sure to please even fans of early Ludlum. I look forward to reading the next 'Jeremy Walker' novel.<br />Highly Recommended.	2004-06-16
3 1/2  stars	See storyline above.<br />Yes, I had to break out the dictionary a couple times (okay, a few), because this novel is full of metaphorical filler. It's filled with alot of prose that just seems to be endless. The storyline and plot had potential and the visuals were extraordinary. Overall a nice effort. The ending and overall explanation meant to convey a religious overtone ruined it. Hopefully you're not going this route because it sells, if you are, you're going to lose some fans.<br />&quot;If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.&quot; -Albert Einstein	2004-06-08
4 1/2	See storyline above.<br />Though he's brought in a new protagonist, Coonts still offers up the intensity and suspense you're accustomed to. The storyline and the pace move along at a speed that will keep you more than satisfied. Jake Grafton plays a pivotal role in the novel, yet he's more of a sideliner (An important one though). A satifying thriller that Coonts fans will enjoy.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-03
Just One Look	See storyline above.<br />Coben's writing style has a tendency to pull you in. The pace. The mystery. The suspense.<br />This book is worth reading, though it's not his best. Most of the mysteries and questions were thrown at you in the last few pages (making it complex enough to make you loopy).<br />Recommended.	2004-05-29
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />When I see Lincoln Child's name on the cover of a book, you can bet I'm going to read it. I have not yet been disappointed.<br />This time he has written a well crafted techno-thriller. The 'techno' portion has been done before in the past (Hal), but the way it's put together with the characters and the dating matchups gives it originality.<br />Recommended.	2004-05-25
One of his best	See storyline above.<br />Vince Flynn offers up one of his best novels yet in this well rounded thriller. This novel is not only timely, it offers up a character (Mitch Rapp) who knows what it takes to win war on terrorism, like it or not.<br />An exciting story you'll want to read quickly. Looking forward to the next Rapp novel.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-19
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above. Preferrably the Booklist review.<br />As a somewhat avid thriller reader, there was something about this novel that didn't take with me. There was action and some suspense but it seemed to lack the gripping pace and 'pull you in' writing that I come to expect.<br />This is my first David Lindsey novel. I'm not sure if there will be another.	2004-05-02
A winner!	See storyline above.<br />In my opinion, congratulations are in order for Phillip Margolin for writing, what I think, is one of his best novels to date. The cliched 'hard to put down' is fitting in this case. A thriller/mystery that proves that Margolin is at the top of his game. Keepem' comin'<br />Highly Recommended.	2004-04-28
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Jon Land's series with Ben Kamal and Danielle Barnea have me hooked. This latest is one of his best. A fast-paced international thriller that should put the author on the bestseller list.<br />With timely topics and sometime 'over-the-top' action, it's sure to please the thriller crowd. Great entertainment.<br />Highly recommended	2004-04-27
A good story	See storyline above.<br />This is a pleasant and amusing novel from an author who hasn't lost his knack of storytelling. I liked the subject matter (Colliders, etc) and the small education about the Higgs boson (When you get on the scale in the morning, you may be hoping that it registers a smaller number than the day before -- you may be hoping that you've lost weight. It's the quantity of mass in you, plus the force of gravity, that determines your weight. But what determines your mass?).<br />The story moved at a steady pace and kept me entertained.	2004-04-22
Brothers in Arms	See storyline above.<br /> I think that Marcus Wynne has stumbled upon something good by teaming two of his previous protagonists together. This international thriller is fast-paced and satisfying. The subject is timely and the intrigue is here.<br />I felt the ending to be a little less than satisfying due to lack of suspense.<br />Recommended.<br />A rather less than exciting ending.	2004-04-19
Not as good as the first two	See storyline above.<br />I keep waiting for Bill Fitzhugh to write something as funny as his first two novels (Pest Control, Organ Grinders), but his recent novels just haven't quite done it (Maybe Tim Dorsey spoiled it for me).<br /> I've read all his novels and still enjoy his story-telling and his ability to draw you into the plot. They are fun and fast-paced and definitely easy to get through.<br />Recommended.	2004-04-13
Great reading	See storyline above.<br />A fascinating and thought provoking novel. Along with the stunning visuals, Alten has written a well researched (some bio/science and Meso-American history) tale that encompasses science and science fiction.<br />I think some people are taking the stories they read a little too seriously. This is fiction. Pure unadulterated fiction. Enjoy, because your in for one fascinating ride.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-04-09
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Saul's latest is a mix of horror and ghosts and witchcraft. Though there isn't much in the form of originality here, he does a good job of melding all these genres together and creates a story thats engrossing and captivating. The cruelty of kids, as well as parents, is well depicted.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-04-02
Average	See storyliine above.<br />This is the third in a series where James Patterson writes in the first person of a woman. Each time I start one of these stories I just keep thinking Lindsay Boxer is a man, but that's just because male authors obviously know a mans perspective better than a womans, and as a reader it's what I expect (but he seems to do women well?!).<br />Anyway, once I'm into the story I forget most of that and just enjoy the fast-pace and the unexpected turns. A good story that's comparable to the other two in the series.	2004-03-31
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />All I can say is suspend your beliefs and enjoy the show. Filled with death defying action and unbelievable escapes, Matthew Reilly again shows us what adrenaline pounding action is all about. This book almost makes Clive Cussler's writing seem like a pussycat--well, maybe not quite.<br />In an interview at the end of the novel Matthew admits it's &quot;...outrageous and over-the-top...accept that I sometimes have to bend the truth (and, hell, the laws of physics!) for the sake of a roller-coaster story.&quot;<br />This one's strictly for fun. It would also make one heck of a movie--of course the movie would require more computer effects than anything I've seen.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-26
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />A good police procedural. Dan Mahoney's story telling seems to be made for the big screen, but in his writing you get a much better idea of a character's true self.<br />The story moves at a good pace, while the action and drama will keep you going to the very last page.<br />Recommended.	2004-03-23
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Shannon's latest is a no nonsense fast-paced story sure to attract more fans. You get twists and turns as well as a fun ride through Vegas. A highly enjoyable novel.<br /> I have to question the authors knowledge about football in reference to one glaring mistake towards the end. Lets see who's keen enough to catch it.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-20
Erotic Horror	See book summary above.<br />Mark Nykanen's villian loves to torture his subjects, though in the villians eyes, it's not torture, it's to create great art.<br /> Nykanen does a good job setting up the story and laying down the suspense. This novel contains both explicit violence and sex.<br />The first person perspective of the villian gives great depth to that character and shows you just how crazy he is.<br /> A dark and entertaining read.	2004-03-17
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Before you even start to read the book you know the protagonist loses his job, has an affair, and you know Henry collapses. This takes away some of the fun of reading, unpredictability. ( If you don't read the book flap you'll be in for more surprises). That being said, I still liked it.<br /> A sharply written medical thriller which also brings up some interesting ethical issues. Throughout the novel you'll be treated to some of the authors own medical stories. A good read.<br />Recommended.	2004-03-13
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Along with being educated about how companies manipulate their earnings and making financial statements look better than they are (think auditors), Frey will take you on a twisty turny run through smoke and mirrors. With its intricate plotting, this novel is best read in a day or two.<br /> Stephen Frey does a good job explaining big business and accounting, giving you an inkling of an idea how companies like Enron and Worldcom eroded.<br />A suspenseful and fast-moving novel I found very entertaining.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-07
Silva doesn't disappoint	See storyline above.<br />The last in a trilogy of novels, dealing with the unfinished business of the Holocaust, does not disappoint.<br />This well researched novel delivers plenty of action and is written in a gripping and compelling fashion (normal for Silva).<br />International locales include Vienna, Venice, Argentina, and of course, Israel. As you read through all the action be prepared to live through some of the atrocities of the Holocaust.<br />A well rounded thriller sure to please everyone.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-04
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Though White creates great depth with his characters and you get to know what they're feeling emotionally, this novel did'nt have the energy or vigor that I have come to expect. It was a little bit of a struggle to get through, but when I reached the end, I decided it wasn't such a bad book. Stephen White fans will see this as an average effort from the author.	2004-02-28
Great legal thriller	See book summary above.<br />With Bernhardts latest, he proves to be one of the best legal thriller writers out there. The storyline and it's subplots-- one hinting on how weak minds can become so brainwashed into believing something--makes for a great and sometimes graphically violent novel.<br />Keep'em coming William.<br />Highly Recommended.	2004-02-23
Great entertainment	Launch a business, solve grandfather mystery, embarrass Castro, restore CIA pride, decimate mob, help Chamber of Commerce, find gems, and get the Today Show to Miami. While Serge attempts to complete this to-do list, you're in for an incredibly fun ride. <br />You'll have a rip-roaring good time reading this one. There is very few authors (I mean very, very few) that can make me laugh out loud while reading. One of the most entertaining and hilarious books I've read.<br />Highly, Highly recommended.	2004-02-20
Average Lescroart	See storyline above.<br />This was an average novel for Lescroart. It moves at a steady slow pace and sometimes seems a little dry. Though the story was good, it just didn't pull me in like some legal thrillers can.<br />If you liked the previous Dismas Hardy novels you'll probably like this one.	2004-02-19
4 1/2 stars	I, for one, thought this was one of Meltzer's best. Fiction with a high entertainment value.<br />Along with a good look at the workings of the political machine, it provided a suspenseful plot that moved very fast. A very enjoyable getaway.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-02-13
Unabridged audio	From the witty observations to the tongue in cheek delivery, Ellen narrates this almost the way she delivers her standup.<br />I don't think I would have enjoyed the book near as much as I enjoyed this audio.<br />Recommended (Audio only) for Ellen fans.	2004-02-13
Average Green	See book summary above.<br />This was an enjoyable enough novel but Tim Green doesn't quite meet up to his standards this time around.<br />The story had suspense but it was mostly predictable. The characters seemed thin with not alot of background included.<br /> An average suspense thriller good for a quick read.	2004-02-06
4 1/2 stars	See book description above.<br />Brad Thor is becoming one of my favorite international thriller writers. The weaponry is researched, the action is good, and you know his protagonist is invulnerable. The invulnerability of Scot Harvath (like Cusslers' Pitt) will make you suspend belief in the story but it sure makes for great escapist reading. Keep it up Brad Thor, your books keep getting better.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-02-03
4 1/2 stars	With his crisp dialogue and his 'pull you in' writing style, Cannell, once again, provides a suspenseful reading experience while keeping the pace brisk. Cannell's experience as a writer definitely shows, for each new novel seems better than the last.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-02-01
Unabridged audio	A fast entertaining story, written by one of Hollywoods power players, gives you a pretty good idea about the goings on in tinsel town.<br /> This is one story that, perhaps, is perfect for unabridged audio. It's fast paced, easy to follow, and read with flair by Dennis Franz. I kinda liked the jokes too.<br />From inside:<br />&quot;There used to be a writer by the name of Merle Miller, who wrote that people in Hollywood are always touching you - not because they like you, but because they want to see how soft you are before they eat you alive.&quot;<br />Recommended	2004-02-01
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br /><br />While consistently coming out with suspenseful novels, Garrison always seems to add an extra flare. The action takes place not only on the sea (thank goodness) but also on land. Some of his characters do have a tendency to be super human (a youngster sailing halfway around the world and a guy who loses an eye, which hardly effects him).<br /> His knowledge of the sea comes through clearly in all his novels. Of course I have very little knowledge about sailing and the sea, so while I learn more from his books, much of it still goes over my head (ref: boat parts and shipping terms). Yet even with all the boating jargon it makes for a gripping thriller.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-01-27
4 1/2 stars	I love tales of adventure, especially when it involves the jungle and tales of the Mayans. This one was very entertaining but it doesn't add much when it comes to originality. You get your typical dangers such as piranhas, anacondas and jaguars. The characters are original and likeable (I especially liked the humorous dialogue between Don Alfonso and Sally), which helped the story. I still recommend this highly and think it's one entertaining story.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-22
3 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />This will not rank as one of my favorite Harrison novels. As one reviewer notes its more a literary thriller. Plenty of prose here. Once you develop compassion for the protagonist it gets a little better, but overall I still think its a little over-written, though at the same time well-written (this might only make sense to me). Not something I'd read over again.	2004-01-19
Fine job	Joseph Finder's latest should put him on the bestseller list. He's at his peak with his 'Big Business' thrillers just as Grisham was years ago with his legal thrillers. You'll gain a whole new perspective on the world of high-tech as you rush to the end of this highly enjoyable thriller. Keep up the good work Joe.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-17
4 1/2 stars	Russell Andrews will satisfy most thriller fans with this scientific thriller. It was well paced with a good storyline. It did seem that cruelty came a little to easy to the protaganist (Justin Westwood). Overall a very satisfying thriller (I wouldn't categorize this as a police procedural) that wrapped up a little to quickly.<br />&quot;If you stumbled onto the fountain of youth, what would you do? Jump in or board it up so no one could find It?&quot;<br />Recommended.	2004-01-15
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br /><br />I just finished reading 'Retribution'. Fantastic. It definitely has bestseller written all over it. From the graphic descriptions, to the evil that out does Hannibal Lecter, this book really satisfies. The knowledgable Jilliane Hoffman will, most assuredly, be on my must read list.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2004-01-12
Great Thriller	See book summary above.<br />Brendan DuBois should gain many new fans with this more than satisfying thriller. He takes a new angle on the MIA's of Vietnam and makes a very plausible thriller with it.<br />Fast-paced with vivid imagery, this novel will definitely satisfy all thriller readers. It is truly hard to put down.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-09
4 1/2 stars	Kudos to Jim Brown for coming up with this truly entertaining horror/sci-fi thriller. This would be awesome to see on the big screen with todays special effects.<br />Many reviewers are comparing Jim Brown to Koontz and King. Well the reason must be that he comes darn close.<br />This novel was better than his first and I suspect his next one will top this one. Keep'em comin' Jim.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-05
3 stars	I must agree with most of the reviews. Lack of momentum and energy, lack of a gripping storyline, very little suspense, and a story that could have been written (with more excitement) on fewer pages.<br />I did like the cover.	2003-12-26
3 1/2	See book description above.<br />The conclusion almost made up for the rather less than gripping majority of the novel. The timeliness and some of the twists made it worth reading but I hope for a better novel on the next go round. I noticed a few errors in editing also.	2003-12-25
Average	See book description above.<br /> When I started reading this I thought I'd be in for a wild ride, but when I continued reading, the story seemed to move into idle until almost the last quarter of the book where it picked up steam again. Not Koontz' worst and not his best.<br /> Though a very well written book, it did seem to have quite a bit of filler. Odd was very likeable and the book was filled with some quirky and entertaining characters, although they didn't do much.	2003-12-18
Fantastic!	See storyline above.<br />When I started this book I had no idea what I was getting into. The pacing was relentless. The shear action and drama throughout made you want to marathon read to the end. Sure the protagonists seemed to be able to take a lot of pain and punishment, that which would kill the normal man, but the writing was so vivid it made for great escapist fiction.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-16
Great entertainment	See storyline above.<br />Mark T. Sullivan never disappoints and this time I think he has exceeded his previous best.<br />'The Serpent's Kiss' is a highly addictive and gruesome tale, with plotting that will excite any reader of thrillers and mysteries. Interesting locales and some graphic scenes round out this intense story.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-11
Fifth Harmonic	When you see F. Paul Wilson on the cover of a book, you might as well buy it, because it will be one heck of a good story. When it comes to horror, Scifi, or the supernatural, Wilson has the imagination to write a terrific novel.<br />This time around it's basically supernatural. The characters have great depth and the story is filled with passion and action. No disappointment here.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-09
Great Cussler	See storyline above.<br />Cussler again delivers a high level adventure that should please all his fans. This time he throws in a little history about Odysseus' great voyage as well as a lesson in Celtic Culture and the Druids.<br />I thought this was a well rounded adventure and a great escape. One of Cusslers best. It includes all the regular characters, as well as introducing Dirk Pitt's new found son and daughter, Dirk and Summer, who have an adventure of their own. You'll get no disappointment reading this newest adventure.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-06
Abridged audio	A wonderful refresher as well as a lesson in the intriguing field of science. Though I would have preferred an unabridged version, the abridged version is chuck full of the most important discoveries. Bill Bryson has done a wonderful job in making science easy to understand and easy to love.<br />Highly recommended	2003-11-29
Good supernatural thriller	See book summary above.<br />If you liked the previous Repairman Jack novels you'll love this one. If you've not read any of them you might get a little confused as to some of the background (but you'll catch up). Either way you'll enjoy this supernatural thriller.<br />Wilson's ability to pull you into a story is one of the things that makes him one of the best in this genre. His knack of displaying highly visual and sometimes graphic scenes is also a bonus.<br />I don't think I've read anything bad by this author. Keep it up.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-11-25
Black Sheep	See storyline above.<br />In his latest novel Kaiser focuses on GMO's (Genetically Modified Organisms), specifically one that would ruin the oil business with a modified version of ethanol. There is action as well as romance. Much of the time is focused on Jonas Lamb's (the protagonist) relationships--a man who has had six marriages. It moves at a satifying pace with a satisfying ending.<br />Recommended.	2003-11-21
Hmmmm	See book summary above.<br />It seems to me that Clive Cussler is lending his name to some up and coming authors. Maybe he should have read this again before putting his name on it. This would have made a heck of a good story if it had a little more depth and characterization but it was presented with too many characters who were given too little time. His next solo effort will surely blow this one out of the water.	2003-11-10
Great thriller	See book summary above.<br />I was very surprised by this international thriller. There wasn't much said about it, yet it ranks right up there with one of the best I've read recently. It's based on the interesting premise of creating a genetic virus that attacks (with 100% fatalities) only certain ethnic groups. The leader of that group is a powerful neo-nationalist japanese industrialist.<br />As well as being very suspenseful and well written, Lewis Perdue has done a lot of research regarding Japan's atrocities during WW2, ranking very near the cruelty of the Nazis. The science is solid, too.<br />I recommend this to anyone who likes a good scientific/medical thriller with international locales.	2003-11-04
unabridged audio	I really enjoyed this unabridged audio.<br />I am neither a democrat or republican and I think both sides have some good ideas.<br /> A very eye opening and in depth look at some of the right wing liars. It always amazes me how so many people believe everything they here on talk radio and TV (this is true on both sides of the political spectrum). That someone like Franken can break it down and analyze it and find the lies makes great reading.<br />Franken narrates in his usual and hilarious manner.<br /> I highly recommend the unabridged cd.	2003-11-01
Average Hunter	See book summary above.<br />I find myself drawn to Stephen Hunter and have always liked the Swagger novels. This one is a little different as it takes place mostly in Cuba. The action is here, as is Earl Swagger and his penchant for getting in trouble, and when the odds are mostly against him he still seems to come out on top. Quite a hero.<br /> This is not my favorite Hunter novel but it was still exciting to read.<br />Recommended.	2003-10-30
3 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />I've read all of Baldacci's books. What he's served up here is not your highly suspenseful thriller or a fast-paced shoot'em up. Instead what you get is a slowly unraveling mystery (and I mean slow), the type of which many authors write. Some people may love this kind of novel, but I don't.<br />It's not what I expected, but as far as straight mystery goes, it works.	2003-10-28
Interesting	See book summary above.<br />I like Kyle Mill's thrillers. To see him come out with something different took me a little by surprise. I'm not disappointed, though. Smoke Screen is a tale of big business and the tobacco industry. There are arguments for both the anti-tobacco lobby and the Tobacco companys. The solution seems to me to be ideal, but not likely to come to fruition. So whether you're a smoker or not, you'll get plenty of ammo from this novel.<br />The protagonist, Trevor Barnett, did not strike me as a very likeable character. He seemed naive and wishy washy (not knowing which way to go on an issue).<br />This novel will have some naysayers, only because their used to the typical Mill's thrillers, but I enjoyed this foray into a different genre (probably because I used to smoke) and will continue looking for Kyle Mills on the book shelf.<br />Recommended.	2003-10-25
Great thriller	See storyline above.<br />This is, what I think, one of his best novels of recent past. An exciting thriller that will take you to the past. With scenes about the 'tunnel rats' of Vietnam to the atrocities put forth by the Milosevics, including a wife, son and daughter described as making &quot;...the Munsters look like Little House on the Prairie&quot;, too the present, with hero/protagonist Calvin Dexter out to capture Zoran Zilic (the name even sounds evil) an old Milosevic henchman.<br /> I'd really like to see this become a series. With a great skill at writing international thrillers and a super hero like Calvin Dexter, how can you go wrong.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-22
Fast	See storyline above.<br />Though somewhat short and a little light on character depth (it's been many books ago since I've read his last one so I don't remember the characters), this McMahon medical thriller was satisfying. This one is comparable to McMahons previous novels.<br />Recommended	2003-10-13
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />When you read a Brian Haig novel you expect a fast-paced, gripping story that sometimes has graphic scenes, along with some quick witted dialogue from its sharp-tongued protagonist, Sean Drummond. This is indeed what you get.<br />I did kind of miss Imelda Pepperfield (she had a very small cameo).<br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-09
Excellent!	See storyline above.<br />An excellent and surprising novel from one of my favorite authors. I've gained a whole new respect for you Greg Iles. The entertainment you packed into this Scifi/thriller is wonderful. I haven't read a book this fast since Dan Brown's 'The DaVinci Code'. Seems you've stirred the pot a little bit here too, judging by some of the negative reviews. One of the things I like about fiction is the exploration of new and fresh ideas. This delivers.<br />&quot;God is merely a part of the human brain, an evolutionary coping mechanism that developed to make bearable our awareness of our own deaths.&quot; A quote by one of the numerous scientific characters in the book.	2003-10-03
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />This being Steve Berry's first novel, I think he did a fine job.<br />A well researched story about the Amber Room along with an illuminating look at the world of treasure hunters and lost treasures makes for interesting reading. It also makes a good thriller.<br />Don't expect a Dan Brown novel just because he wrote a positive blurb.<br />Though not as riveting as some, this novel kept me entertained.<br />I will read his next novel knowing it will be as good or better than the first.<br />Recommended.	2003-09-28
Comparable to Wolfe	See storyline above.<br />This was a pleasant departure from what I normally read (suspense/thrillers). The last book I read like this was Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full.<br />It entertains at the same time it educates. You'll get a taste of the corporate life as well as the prison life. A well rounded novel written in a wonderfully entertaining and informative manner.<br />Recommended.	2003-09-23
Great entertainment	See synopsis above.<br />I liked the storyline. I liked the premise. I liked the pace and the intensity. Pottinger has put together an intense thriller that will grab you by the gut and won't let loose until you get to the very satisfying end.<br />The idea of biological/genetic terrorism comes to light, especially when it's written by Stan Pottinger.<br />Nicely done.<br />&quot;There are rules for everyone else, and then there are rules for monsters&quot;<br /> Highly recommended.	2003-09-13
4 1/2 star adventure	See book description above.<br />With the knowledge of George Wallace and the writing skill of Don Keith you get an adventure well worth the read. This novel covers a lot of territory. From the ins and outs of submarines to the covert ops of the War on Drugs. Well worth your time. I look forward to this duos next novel.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-09-09
4 1/2 star unabridged audio	See storyline above.<br />I hate to say it but Evanovich's novels are one of the funnest and enjoyable to listen to. This one was read by Lorelei King and she did an outstanding job with the narration and the voices (Lula just makes you laugh out loud). Easy to follow and perfect for the drive too and from work.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-09-06
4 1/2 stars	See synopsis above.<br />Ben Kincaid returns as Bernhardt's likeable protagonist. An outstanding attorney that somehow gets by, even though he doesn't ever seem to make money.<br />Kincaid and his sidekicks--you gotta like Loving and his crazy conspiracy theories--whoop it up again in a very enjoyable legal/suspense thriller. I think this is one of Bernhardt's best. A gripping storyline written in a style that will draw you in.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-09-04
Good	See synopsis above.<br />This was my first Catherine Coulter book. I liked it. Fast paced, to the point and with characters you love to hate. It was a quick read and a quick escape. I will give Catherine's next book a try.<br />Recommended.	2003-08-23
4 1/2 stars	See synopsis above.<br />First I'd like to say that Gregg Hurwitz has put together a well rounded thriller. Hurwitz's lead character Tim Rackley has lost his young daughter to a brutal murder. What Hurwitz has done well is portray the pain that Rackley feels. The emotional dilemmas involved with the loss of a child hits close to home to anyone with a child. Along with the strong emotions there are ethical problems that are portrayed in the story concerning vigilanteism. Right or wrong? With the novel also comes plenty of action. Put all together, you get a great story that will keep you entertained. It might make you mad or it might make you happy, either way it will make you think.<br />The only negative I have is with the character of Rackley. I did not care to much for him. Maybe because of his views or because of his hypocrisy.<br />Recommended	2003-08-20
4 1/2 stars	The saga continues as John Rain again becomes the center of a very entertaining thriller. While reading this satisfying thriller you'll also learn quite a bit about Japan. Barry Eisler has a good thing going and I hope he keeps it up.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-08-13
4 1/2 stars	See synopsis above.<br />Well, to start with, I really enjoyed this novel. The premise was a little unbelievable but the entertainment quotient was high. I thought the characters were more than one dimensional and seemed to think there was depth to quite a few of them.<br /> The story itself was sometimes repetitive (meaning certain descriptions were repeated many times). This is good entertainment. I look forward to the next Zeman novel knowing it will be as good or better.<br />Recommended.	2003-08-08
4 1/2  stars	See storyline above.<br />James Grippando is another of my favorite authors. He never has disappointed me yet.<br />His latest starts with a bang and doesn't let up till the end. It has witty dialogue (especially between Theo and Jack) along with a writing style that will keep you turning the pages.<br />I recommend this to everyone who likes a good mystery/thriller.	2003-08-06
Fantastic	See synopsis above.<br />After I read 'Amazonia' I put James Rollins on my must read list. I am so glad I did. In 'Ice Hunt' he takes adventure to a new level. The book's intense, the main subject very interesting (cryopreservation), and it reads like a combination of 007, Indiana Jones, and Dirk Pitt. A well rounded--and researched--adventure sure to please anyone with a taste for quality adventure.<br />I have to agree with the Amazon reviewer, though. The cover art gives it a somewhat hokey look (mass market?).<br />Most highly recommended.	2003-08-01
4 1/2 stars	'Runaway Heart' refers to Herman Strockmeyer, an attorney described by some as &quot;...a tree-and-bunny hugger who has sued just about every federal letter agency in the government&quot;. Well this time around he might just have a legitimate case.<br />The story moves at a rapid pace and concerns an interesting subject, top secret government experiments with DNA. You'll even get treated with a cameo by Shane Scully.<br />Cannell writes with a flare. You'll be finished reading this before you know it, feeling quite satisfied. Like a good movie.<br />Higly recommended.	2003-07-27
Not up to par	See storyline above.<br />First of all I don't remember Jack Higgins previous novels being this bad. Okay, the plot had potential and the action was there, but this book seemed like it was very rushed. The characters didn't seem there usual self (Dillon being stopped by a tractor in the road? No other explanation?). Please. The brevity of the book and the rushed style (very little depth) made for a very disappointing read.<br />Not recommended.	2003-07-23
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />A fast-paced, no nonsense delivery is what you expect from Cussler. That's what you get. I too was surprised when I received this in a hardback instead of the paper. What I thought (since it was a hardback) was that Kurt Austin was going to replace Dirk Pitt as Cusslers main protagonist. I also got the impression that I would be reading a better novel (such as the Dirk Pitt hardbacks). Well it is good entertainment, and without a doubt, action packed, but its become a bit formulaic.<br />I will still always jump on the newest Cussler novel and certainly look forward to the newest Dirk Pitt.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-20
Top rate entertainment	See book summary above.<br />Preston and Child. These are two names I love seeing on a book cover. What they deliver is pure entertainment. Fast-paced action with an original theme.<br />The protagonist, Pendergast, is also a mystery in himself, but still one of my favorite characters.<br />The action, along with a surprise ending, makes this an exciting and thrilling story.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-18
Good escapist fiction	See book summary above.<br />Lee Childs' Reacher novels never disappoint me. I agree the main character (Jack Reacher) is not very personable, but he is likeable and he always gets the bad guy. This you know from previous novels and this is also what makes it good escapist fiction. It gives you a good feeling when the bad guys go down.<br />Fast-paced and a lot of action. A novel you'll finish quickly.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-26
Keeps getting better	See book description above.<br />I am never disappointed with James W. Hall. His novels always keep me on edge and it seems he gets better and better with each novel. This time around he seems to have made his protagonist, Thorn, a little more human, and not quite the superhero he was in previous novels. A fast paced and very gripping story. Keep up the good work.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-19
3 1/2 unabridged audio	See book summary above.<br />I actually listened to the whole book on audio and it wasn't easy. I kept expecting something more.<br /> It honestly sounded like a romance novel with just a little action. I read the first book of this series many, many books ago and didn't remember much of it...and this book certainly didn't refresh my memory much. If you like romance novels you'll somewhat enjoy this one (even though it's a ridiculous premise--Bird kids?. Yes I know it was all explained in the first novel, but still.)<br />Hopefully Patterson will team up with a better author, such as  he did with the novel &quot;Jester&quot;, and I can start enjoying a Patterson book again.	2003-06-15
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />You'll have a fun time trying to figure out if it's fantasy or reality for the protagonist, Charlie Monk, in this entertaining adventure. Though some of the story is plausible (the genetics) and some not so much (memory implants), it works together fairly well. A fast-paced twisting ride sure to entertain.	2003-06-10
Not a review	Well I made it through about 220 pages (read in one day) before I realized that this is probably not worth finishing. If I didn't have a back log of newer books on the shelf waiting to be read I would have suffered through the whole thing. Then again, if I had read the whole thing, maybe it would have been worth it. For what I expect and want from Koontz, it was not. Koontz, without a doubt, has a way with words, and with these he seems to be trying a new serious form that I just didn't care for. Oh well, maybe next time.	2003-06-09
3 1/2 stars	Though it's an easy way out of writing a critigue, I pretty much have to mirror everything PW has to say about this book. I know if F. Paul Wilson alone would have written this novel it would no doubt have been much better. Not an incredibly solid read with a less than fulfilling ending. The whole concept of the story was good but the 'putting together' was not.	2003-06-07
4 1/2 stars unabridged audio	What gave this novel the kick it needed was the excellent narration by Tom Stechschulte. He gave this very eerie story power. Dennis Lehane is a fine author but I think this novel ranks just a bit below his last.<br />Highly recommended for the audio.	2003-06-02
4 stars	See book summary above.<br />This is no doubt good escapist fiction. The characters lack depth and the story moves very rapidly. Because of the characters shallowness I found myself not really caring about them. The plot was unique in its look at fear, and along with a few other twists, it still made for a quick and exciting read.<br />Recommended for all Morrell fans.	2003-05-28
Great thriller	Once again Vince Flynn comes through with an exceptional thriller which is both timely and provocotive. The story comes straight from todays headlines. From the jungles of the Philippines to the Israeli/Palestinian fiasco, Flynn's protragonist, Mitch Rapp, tracks down the evil elements and actually gives them what they deserve. A great thrill ride.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-22
4 1/2 stars	The most popular comment on this book seems to be &quot;hard to put down&quot;. There are thrillers out there that are harder to put down than this one. Though Coben has written a great mystery, I think his previous novels are just as well written and told. To me the beginning seemed a little drawn out.<br /> The characters are great, the story will keep you guessing, and the plot is well rounded. This is still a solid mystery with a lot of twists.<br />Recommended.	2003-05-16
All thrills	Maxim holds nothing back in his latest thriller. The story is fast-paced, the subject is timely, and it makes for one heck of an exciting day of reading. Pure adrenaline.<br />I look forward to the next Bannerman novel.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-15
4 1/2 stars	Synopsis.<br />&quot;Haunted by their pasts, Grace McBride and the crew of her software company, Monkeewrench, create a computer game where the killer is always caught and the good guys always win. But their game becomes a nightmare when someone begins duplicating the fictional murders in real life, down to the last detail.&quot;<br />I think the mother/daughter duo have written a wonderful debut.<br />It will keep you guessing and it will keep you reading. The dialogue is humorous and the plot original. I look forward to more.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-08
Great Sci-fi	Synopsis<br />&quot;A new science thriller, &quot;Sims&quot; takes place in the very near future, when the science of genetics is fulfilling its vaunted potential. It's a world where genetically transmitted diseases are being eliminated, and manual labor is gradually being transferred to &quot;sims, &quot; genetically altered chimps who occupy a gray zone between simian and human.&quot;<br />If you can overlook the fact that Congress--in this novel--determined that the use of these genetically made simian creatures (almost human and can speak english) are not animal or human, but rather property, then you'll enjoy this novel immensely. As I read further into the novel it somewhat explained the reason behind Congress' decision.<br /> The writing is superb, as one can expect from Wilson. The gripping story line and the rapid pace will leave you satisfied to the very end.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-01
One of his best	A top-secret computer program is on the verge of going live--but could wreak havoc on the nation's aviation routines--in this timely new thriller.<br />I think Skyhook is one of Nance's best works yet. His knowledge in the airline field, as well as computers and the law, make this a well rounded thriller that should please all of Nances' fans.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-28
Average Kinkster	Author Walter Snow has writer's block until he is initiated into the outrageous escapades of Clyde Potts &amp; Fox Harris, who are always in search of bigger &amp; better pranks, including sabotaging a huge corporate monster.<br />With his off beat characters and zany situations the Kinkster provides his readers with a welcome relief from the mundane.<br />Though this is an average Kinky novel, It's still outrageous and genuine Kinky, so the fans should love it. A fun quick read.<br />Recommended.	2003-04-21
The White Road	See book summary above.<br />This is John Connolly's fourth novel. It's also his best.<br />He brings some memorable characters back from his previous novel and makes them even more memorable. You become engulfed in the story all the way to its exciting conclusion. Top notch entertainment.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-13
His best	See book summary above.<br />Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs return in what I think is Deaver's best work yet.<br />His writing style just wraps you into his mystery's and you're just barely holding on through all the twists and turns. A fantabulous story that will also give you some insight on how magicians think.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-07
His best	See book summary above.<br />Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs return in what I think is Deaver's best work yet.<BR>His writing style just wraps you into his mystery's and you're just barely holding on through all the twists and turns. A fantabulous story that will also give you some insight on how magicians think.<br />Hoghly recommended.	2003-04-07
His best	See book summary above.<br />Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs return in what I think is Deaver's best work yet.<BR>His writing style just wraps you into his mystery's and you're just barely holding on through all the twists and turns. A fantabulous story that will also give you some insight on how magicians think.<br />Hoghly recommended.	2003-04-07
Fun	See book summary above.<br />I've read all of Fitzhugh's books and this one ranks as average. Not his best work but still more fun to read than most authors of this genre--of which there are not enough. Keep'em coming and I'll keep readin'.<br />Recommended	2003-04-01
4 1/2 stars. Par for Margolin	See book summary above.<br />If you can keep up with the plot and all its characters you'll find this to be a very rewarding thriller. There are some twists and turns you won't see coming, along with thrills and suspense.<br />This is an average novel by Margolin, which still makes it good.<br />Recommended.	2003-03-25
The Last Detective	See book summary above.<br /> A fast paced thriller that is sure to be one of Robert Crais' best. It hooks you at the beginning and doesn't let up until it's riveting conclusion. Most likely a book you'll read in one or two sessions.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-03-20
Jester	See storyline above.<br />From the front cover to the final page, this is one exciting, enjoyable and entertaining story. I do like adventures from the Middle Ages. At times graphic (as the Middle Ages are known to have been) and at times like a fairy tale, you'll feel emotions ranging from hate to love. I think Patterson and Gross have written one of their best.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-03-17
A great thriller	See book summary above.<br />This is the first title I've read by Earl Emerson, and I am duly impressed. This is not so much about firefighters as it is about one mans race against time. A race to save his own life, as well as others. The suspense is here as is the character development. A first rate thriller.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-03-12
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />It seems everyone gets their due in this novel. The bad guys and the reader. A highly satisfying read. I'm highly curious who Ray Shannon really is (it's a pseudonym), because I'm willing to bet he/she is a well known author.<br />This was a fast moving entertaining ride. If there was a little more humor thrown in it would definitely rate a five.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-03-10
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />A richly entertaining psychological thriller. The protagonist, one of my favorite characters named Alan Gregory, seems to have picked up another one of those patient's that cause grief in his life. What fun.<br />With just the right amount of action, along with the twists and turns, this is one of Stephen White's best.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-03-04
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />Tim Green's latest is a satisfying and fast-paced novel. The subject matter of child rapists is very hate inducing, thus making Jack Ruskin a hero to many people, including me.<br />Green has not disappointed me yet and this novel is as good as his others.<br />Recommended.	2003-03-03
Average	See storyline above.<br />Though I usually really like a Martini, this one did not mix as well as his previous works. It didn't have the smooth flow I'm used to. The story was good and overall easy to read, but it just didn't have the catch I really like. Maybe next time.	2003-02-26
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />Though he goes a little overboard with what he thinks cyberterrorists are capable of, he still provides a very entertaining thriller. The cyber thrills are as moving as the real life thrills and chases. Both provide the reader with quite a bit of suspense.<br />As a computer engineer, R.J. Pineiro has the background, and as an author he has the skill.<br />Recommended.	2003-02-24
Hilarious	See book summary above.<br />I've read all of Dorsey's books and this one was my favorite. A hilarious laugh out loud ride.<br /> Though Hiaasen is in the same category I still seem to get a few more laughs from Dorsey. I think the characters are a little more zany.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-02-18
Was this really Coonts?	See book summary above.<br />\\"During the Middle Ages in Europe ignorant, illiterate people were manipulated by appeals to the strains of intolerance and fanaticism that are part and parced of every religion. The Crusades, the popes' wars on heresy, the Spanish Inquisition, the war between Catholicism and Protestantism...all these horrors were committed in God's name. The result was the rise of the secular states, which grew into nations.<br />The Muslim world didn't move on--it's still trapped in the Middle Ages. Islam teaches that man should live a life that earns him God's mercy--it's no better or worse than any other religion.  Yet the Islamic fanatics are exporting the horrors to a developed world that moved on centuries ago. Perhaps this war between religion and secular society is a stage that every civilization has to go through. Maybe it's the only way for a people to gradually learn tolerance, which is the foundation for complex societies that can entertain new possibilities, new visions.\\"<br />This is a Jake Grafton speech (the protagonist of this and previous novels) and like it or not the book is filled with many of these little gems. This is about the only positive thing I can say about this Grafton novel. Yes I was disappointed. When I see Stephen Coonts on a book cover, no less a Jake Grafton novel, I expect alot. This didn't deliver. If you didn't read it in two or three sittings it's sometimes hard to remember who certain characters are, of which there are many. Maybe I'm just getting old but this one seemed to be a chore to read.	2003-02-12
Excellent adventure	See book summary above.<br /> A fast-paced no nonsense adventure sure to please all Carsten's fans. The politics of Cuba as well as adventures on the open sea are a major part of this satisfying story, along with some graphic writing that creates a vivid picture in your mind. Carsten Stroud will definitely be on my must read list.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-02-05
Great thriller	See book summary above.<br />Brian Haig is one of my favorite authors. This novel puts him in that field of great thriller writers. His novels are well researched and his writing style draws the reader in.<br />The protagonist, Sean Drummond, is very likeable. Maybe because he rarely takes anything seriously.<br />A solid and suspenseful novel sure to please all thriller readers.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-31
4 1/2 stars	See book summary above.<br />As usual, I can count on Stephen Frey to write an entertaining and gripping novel. With his past in the field of investing, Mr. Frey knows of what he writes.<br />Filled with some twists and some turns, this some time intricately plotted novel will give the reader alot of enjoyment.<br />Recommended.	2003-01-30
Good escape	The summary is quoted from Bradthor.com<br />\\"Fresh from rescuing the President from kidnappers, Navy SEAL turned Secret Service agent Scot Harvath shifts his attentions to rooting out, capturing or killing all those responsible for the plot. As he prepares to close out his list, a bloody and twisted trail of clues points towards one man - the world's most feared, most ruthless terrorist, Hashim Nidal. Having assembled an international league of Islamic terrorist networks in an ingenious plot to topple both Israel and America, Harvath and his CIA-led team must reach Nidal before it's too late. One problem remains - they have no idea what the man looks like...\\"<br />I give this a five star rating because it was outstanding escapist fiction. The pace is relentless. You'll visit Bern, Chicago, Cairo, Jerusalem, The island of Capri, and Rome, along with a couple other spots. And yes its main focus is the dispute between the Israeli's and the Palestinians. What a surprise there, huh?<br />By the way, when two jumpers use one parachute it's called tandem jumping. A good way for beginners to get their first jump in.	2003-01-21
Average unabridged audio	See story summary above.<br />Other than its timely subject, this came off as a somewhat average thriller. Parts of it made you hold on tight and other parts just kept you lingering.<br />Again I must commend Dick Hill's job at the skill and range in reading these types of novels. He can make an average novel seem better.	2003-01-16
Dead Aim	See book summary above.<br />An invigorating and tightly written novel that you've come to expect from Thomas Perry, with a couple exceptions.<br />The character of Robert Mallon was indeed shallow. Was his obsession with the suicide victim because of their brief love-making/loneliness or was it because of his sister's suicide years previous. One is never really sure.<br />And where the heck did this guy at the end come from? Sure his name was Mallon but no where did I see his nickname as 'First Blood' Mallon.<br />An overall entertaining novel with a couple flaws.	2003-01-16
Utopia	See book summary above.<br />When I see Lincoln Child's name on any novel, I'm gettin' it. With this first solo attempt he hits a home run. What Lincoln Child has created in this novel is an elaborate theme park (in fact some of the descriptions of the park are so overwhelming they are hard to picture, so the author was thoughtful enough to put an illustration at the start) based on past cultures as well as future cultures.<br />This is a very entertaining and exciting novel. For some reason while I was reading this story, the movie 'Die Hard' kept coming to mind. Hmmm.<br />Highly recommended...strictly pleasure.	2003-01-12
4 1/2 stars	Summary below is from Cannell.com.<br />\\"Back on the LAPD and hailed as a hero after taking down a deadly gang of rogue cops in The Viking Funeral, Shane Scully finds himself unwittingly involved in a criminal scheme to take over the movie business.<br />Soon, he will have to go deep undercover to uncover a Hollywood conspiracy.<br />At a glamorous party with his new wife, Alexandra, Shane hears a world- famous producer make an ominous remark about the strange deaths of his ex-wives. This is more than police business, it's personal: Alexandra's closest friend is engaged to the producer. When he looks closer, Scully discovers that the man's mysterious past may hide deadly secrets.<br />To uncover them, he must work alongside a former down-and-outer-turned-Hollywood impresario to infiltrate the movie business' violent dark side, a world where deals are settled with handshakes but broken with the spilling of blood, and where the danger to Shane's loved one is all too real.\\"<br />After 35 years in Hollywood, Stephen J. Cannell knows what he's writing about. With this gripping crime drama he again gives you a glimpse on the inside 'goings on' of Hollywood.<br />The fact is this tale involves everyone from the Crips and Bloods to the Italian as well as Mexican Mafias. Together with Cannell's writing skills, this spells excitement.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-05
One of his best	See book description above.<br />Dean Koontz's last few novels have been somewhat average. This time around he has come out of his rut (not a big rut, of course) and served up some fantastic reading. The subject is the ever popular nanotechnology, though with Koontz you get the nanotech with a big dose of the supernatural. Koontz writes this novel with a certain flare. The prose, as well as the dialogue, is top-notch. Jilly (&quot;I should warn you I know Karaoke&quot;), Dylan, and his autistic brother Shep, make for an original and very likeable group of protagonists.<br />Dean Koontz has written one of his best novels and I highly recommend this to all his fans and to those looking for a fast paced thriller.	2003-01-03
Buck Fever	See book description above.<br />YeeeeHawwww! This was a fun one.<br />The writing was fast and furious. The story line original and outrageous. As a first novel, Ben Rehder has started out on the right foot. Keep up the good work.<br />If you're looking for something fun, yet not to serious, to read, be sure you give Rehder a shot.<br />Recommended.	2002-12-29
Jackdaws clone	See book description above.<br />Written in the same vein as &quot;Jackdaws&quot;, This World War 2 novel is also about some unlikely heroes.<br />Ken Follett can certainly tell a good story though his last couple novels are not his best. They have good depth and characters but the story is not as thrilling and involving as his older works. As everyone else seems to think, his earlier novels are much better. 'Pillars of the Earth' is one of my all time favorites. I'm not yet giving up on reading Follett but I certainly hope his next novel will be like his old novels.<br />Still Recommended for the Follett fan.	2002-12-27
Moist	See book description above.<br />I was not at all disappointed with this somewhat dark comedy, which one author described as having &quot;real machine gun narrative&quot;. As mentioned by other reviewers, Smith is comparable to Hiaasen (but not quite at his level) and also, I think, Fitzhugh. For a first novel, Smith has written one heck of an entertaining story with an assortment of unusual characters.<br />Recommended.	2002-12-22
The Eighth Day read in one.	See book description above.<br />A John Case novel never seems to disappoint my reading fix. His scientific thrillers are timely, and once you start reading, hard to put down.<br />One of the main subjects in the book is nanotechnology. This subject has been the theme of several books over the last couple years but Case does a superb job by taking you all over the world on an adventure that includes everything from 'The Contrade' (a brutal horse race in Italy) to the land of the Kurds. There is also talk of Yezidis', Anchorites, 'Black Writing', and more.<br />A well rounded thriller sure to keep you entertained.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-12-17
unabridged audio	See book description above.<br />I must be missing out on something by not reading the book, but the unabridged audio did not satisfy me in the least. The protagonist, Jackson Maebry, seemed very naive. His obsession with Allie made him look like a schmuck. I did not care at all what happened to him, for that matter, I didn't care what happened to anyone in this story. Borriinnng.<br />I have a feeling if I'd have started the book I would not have finished it.<br />Patrick Girard Lawlor does a good job with the narration.	2002-12-16
No One To Trust	See book description above.<br />As noted by other reviewers this does not stand out as one of Johansen's best. She delivers a quick and suspenseful story with somewhat shallow characters, and spends a little to much time trying to give Elena and Sean's relationship depth.<br />There is one thing that bothers me about stories like this. The author describes throughout the whole book how torturous and evil and murderous the bad man is and even describes the brutal tortures. Why is it these bad guys always get the easy way out? Painless Death. Sorry for ranting.<br />Recommended	2002-12-02
A pleasant departure	See book description above.<br />Another reviewer thought this was like a late night movie. I myself will compare it to a made for TV movie, although it would do best on the Lifetime channel.<br />It was a pleasant departure from his normal thrillers, and because it was somewhat short, I decided to give it a try. I liked it. Baldacci can draw you into a story to where you actually care about the characters. Almost all the characters in this pleasant novel had something you liked about them.<br />I don't read stories like this very often and prefer to stick with thrillers, but it's nice to take a break every once in a while and read something 'feel good'. And it kind of makes a person want to hop on a train.<br />Recommended.	2002-11-21
Unabridged Audio	See book description above.<br />Alex Cross returns in what will supposedly be his last case before retiring. The story itself was average Patterson. A suspenseful, and overall entertaining mystery. The reader, Michael Emerson, did a good job with the voices. This novel didn't stand out as some of Patterson's novels do.<br />Of course you get the normal short chapters that lack some depth, but that's what makes a James Patterson novel, James Patterson.<br />Recommended.	2002-11-19
3 1/2 stars	See book description above.<br />This is probably my least favorite Hagberg novel. It moved at a fast pace, but the main topic of brainwashed assassins going after Kirk McGarvey, the soon to be director of the CIA, just didn't seem to take my interest. Convoluted comes to mind. Maybe it's just my mood but that's what I think.	2002-11-17
3 1/2 stars	See book description above.<br />The best thing about this book was the ending. Everything else was average. The main character, Henry Pierce, was not likeable. Maybe it was because he seemed very naive. His quest to find a missing prostitute made no sense. Why would anybody do what he did (risk his company and his life) to find someone whose phone number he was accidentally issued (or so it seems). Even his past history with his sister didn't seem reason enough. When you can't sympathize with the main character it's hard to really enjoy the story.	2002-11-09
Outstanding	See book description above.<br />I was rather apprehensive when I purchased this book, but in hindsight, it was the best purchase I've made in years (as far as novels go). As far as international thrillers go this is by far the best one that carries the Ludlum name. It is truly non-stop action, and along with that you get highly intelligent dialogue and story telling. It seems to be just a step above the normal Ludlum novel.<br />Keith Kahla was the senior editor that supposedly put this novel together. The publisher says about three quarters of the book was finished when Ludlum passed away.<br />A truly wonderful work of suspense. I wonder if there's a chance we might see Janson and Kincaid again. That I would surely like to see.<br />HIGHLY Recommended.	2002-11-06
A fascinating thriller.	Clay Williams has been living in Hong Kong for the last ten years. He is a former FBI agent and is presently working as security chief for one of the worlds largest construction projects. The building, known as 'The Gold Swan' because its shape is similar to a swans neck, is the worlds tallest building coming in at 2500 feet. When Williams realizes the building is starting to lean, he discovers a conspiracy within the government to keep it quiet.<br />Thayer's solid writing along with his 'grab you by the seat' story telling made this a fun thriller to read. From the power struggles in the Chinese government to the powerful triads running the cities to the descriptions of Hong Kong(which made you feel as if you were there), I felt like this was a well rounded thriller and one of Thayer's best.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-29
4 1/2 stars	See book description above.<br />A well plotted crime drama with a wide variety of characters and a very likeable protagonist named Nick Sasso. The writing style will keep you enthralled. With all the suspense and emotional depth you'll be sure to be satisfied.<br />Recommended	2002-10-25
Fun stuff	See book description above.<br />While poking fun at everything from Dan Rather to the Presidency, Buckley's satirical novel is also a good legal thriller. When I pick up a Buckley novel, I know I'm in for a treat, and this was quite the treat. I think this is his best so far.<br />Highly recommended	2002-10-21
4 1/2 stars	Unabridged audio.<br />This time around Dave Barry's rag-tag bunch of characters all have one thing in common. They will all be passengers or hired help on a casino boat that will float about three miles off the coast of Florida. As usual there is a wide assortment of characters. There are a couple old folks who escaped a retirement home, a band called 'Johnny and the Contusions' whose main goal is to be high, drug runners, cocktail waitress's and a few others. All play a major role in this laugh out loud story.<br />The reader, Dick Hill, is a very talented voice actor. From his mobster voice to his old man voice, the inflections put forth are truly hilarious.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-15
Outstanding	See book description above.<br />I just finished this outstanding novel and just know there will be nothing that can touch this for a long time. Because I like the field of science so much, it was just wonderful putting all this highly researched science with a wonderful and epic story. Covering the varied laws of physics to the world to geology.<br /> Wonderful science. Wonderful fiction. Outstanding science fiction.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-13
Great thriller	See book description above.<br />From Kyle Mill's very first novel, I've been a fan. The character of Mark Beamon is a very likeable and admirable hero.<br />The story and characters of Mill's latest are also very timely. From Yasin, a powerful Afghan terrorist, to Volkov, a powerful drug lord. The many characters make for a somewhat intricate plot. Afghan terrorists and drug dealers, local mafia bosses, a  Laotion general, CIA bosses, FBI bosses, Heroin wars, a missing rocket launcher, and of course Mark Beamon and his friends.<br />A great international thriller with vivid story telling.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-08
Outstanding Thriller	See book description above.<br />Mr. Pudd, a violent and truly evil character, is just one of the memorable things about this outstanding thriller. A very well written novel that's vivid and intense, including some very graphic storytelling. John Connolly is indeed an author that goes to the top of my list. Nice Job.<br />Inside the cover: \\"This is a honeycomb world, each hollow linked to the next, each life inextricably intertwined with the lives of others. The loss of even one reverberates through the whole, altering the balance, changing the nature of existence in tiny, imperceptible ways.\\"<br />Highly recommended.	2002-10-04
4 1/2 star unabridged audio	See book description above.<br />The unabridged version of this book was also good. The reader, James Daniel, narrated at a steady pace but in a sometime undramatic way. The story itself was strong and addicting. The subject seemed timely (IPO's and the stock market) and combined with international intrigue, it made a very satisfying and suspenseful story.<br />Recommended.	2002-10-01
Great entertainment	See book description above.<br /> Beyond Grisham and beyond Margolin, James Grippando gives us 'Beyond Suspicion'. A truly exciting thriller worthy of bestsellerdom. From viatical investors, to the Russian Mafiya, this well rounded and solid thriller moves at a breakneck pace that should please all readers of suspense. It is very rare that I give a 5 star and Harriet gives a 4 star. What's up with that?<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-26
4 1/2 stars	Dr. Carroll Monks, an emergency room doctor, saves a mysterious man from a heroin overdose. A mysterious fire breaks out and the mans blood samples are stolen.<br />Dr. Monks sets out to learn more about the man he saved and soon finds himself in a very dangerous situation.<br />The rapid pace, as well as the subject matter (The human genome), makes it a quick and exciting read. A good hi-tech medical thriller.<br />Recommended.	2002-09-24
Great thriller	See book description above.<br />How far would you go to raise your childs IQ. Gary Braver's latest thriller brings this question, and many more, to mind.<br />A fascinating and intriguing medical/science thriller with a high dose of reality that covers a controversial subject. Intelligence enhancement.<br />Well written and fast-paced. This will go onto my 'top five novels' of the year list.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-21
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />As a gambler myself, I could definitely see the big picture and felt alot of what Delaney (Jimmy D) felt. The fear of going back to the casino when you know you mostly lose.<br />This was a fun book to read though I would have liked it to be a little longer with just a bit more depth. A perfect book for the ride to and from Vegas.<br />Brian Rouff has a lot of potential and I will keep my eye out for his future novels.<br />Recommended	2002-09-17
4 1/2 star unabridged audio	See storyline above.<br /> Very entertaining and laugh out loud funny. The unabridged novel seems to never have a dull moment. It is read by Lorelei King, and she does a fantastic job with the voices. A fun story featuring Stephanie Plum, again having her adventures in bond enforcement. Watch out for the killer rabbit.<br />Highly recommended	2002-09-16
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />One of the main characters in this novel has traveled back in time to save childrens lives. One of those is his own daughter. What James F. David has put together in this novel, will entertain anyone who likes supernatural thrillers. With a serial killer on the loose and a mysterious time traveler, you know you'll be in for a fun ride. Throw in a detective who is hot on their tale, and it's well worth the price. Well written and laced with humor.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-14
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Ben Kincaid, the Tulsa attorney, returns to the front, in one of Bernhardt's best novels yet. When it comes to legal thrillers, William Bernhardt now stands at the top of my list. With a writing style that pulls you into the plot, Bernhardt's story is well written and intense. With the surprises it holds, the reader is sure to be satified.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-12
The Surgeon 2  3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />This seemed to me to be a rehash of her last book. The originality I expected was not here. What I did get out of it, along with the highly descriptive narrative of crime scenes, was the suspense. What you get here is basically a novel that should be entitled 'The Surgeon 2', with not a big difference between the two.	2002-09-10
This is Kinky alright.	This time around, Kinky has to find a missing three-legged cat who resides down in Texas, and a missing autistic child in NYC. With his band of irregulars, including Rambam, Mcgovern, and Ratso, you're treated to another hilarious and unpredictable romp through the mind of Kinky. This is one book you shouldn't have trouble finishing in one sitting. Offbeat and hilarious.<br />Recommended.	2002-09-05
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Labyrinth is one of those stories that you seem to be able to read in a day, only because it's made for a speed reader. There are many parts you can just glance over. There are only so many things you can describe about a cave chase scene. Predictable falls, trips, slides, and cave ins. The saving grace, obviously, was the mad scientist and his search for the moon rock.<br />The premise of using this mostly unexplored cave for the practice of moon miners seemed somewhat silly. Would not regular mines suffice? They're dark.	2002-09-04
First rate thriller	See storyline above.<br />Every time I see Dan Simmons name on a book, I'm going to read it. Joe Kurtz returns as the somewhat noirish hero. An ex-detective who has spent some 12 years in prison. The rapid pace of the story and the gripping narrative will keep you glued to the pages. <BR>A serial killer heads up the bad guys. A killer who has slain more than twenty children in the name of religion. There are a wide assortment of characters that round out this very satisfying thriller, including subplots that involve crooked cops and the mafia. A sometimes graphic portrait of a protagonist that's not worried about the law.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-03

4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />It start's with a standoff between the ATF and FBI and a group of young men holed up in a cabin near Neponset River in Massachusetts. Shots are fired and people are killed. So starts this thriller, written by one of my favorite up and coming authors. Alex Kava has a writing style that will keep you enthralled. I found the involvement of Maggie's mother with 'The Father' to be a little coincidental to the plot, still yet the overall story, along with the suspense and thrills, put a damper on that.<br />Recommended	2002-08-29
4 1/2 Stars	See storyline above<br /> A top-notch thriller with graphic scenes of the emergency room (and Clydes room) with highly descriptive and obviously well researched treatments. It's a story of one doctor's personal ethics. It's a story that packs a lot of suspense with a lot of personal issues. The pace stays fairly strong throughout the story with just an occasional lag.<br />Recommended	2002-08-27
Not highly deceptive	See main storyline above.<br />This time around Ridley teams Daphne Matthews with a different partner, John LaMoia. If you're a reader of Pearson's past novels, you know that LaMoia has a history of drug abuse. Well this time he's clean--not without great effort.<br />The story itself is an average mystery, but it's told in an above average way that only Pearson can write. I guessed the killer early in the novel and am a little surprised that Daphne and John overlooked him/her. It became almost frustrating to me as I kept reading and they remained clueless.<br />It's a story of a stalker that will take you into Seattle's underground. A place I didn't know existed. Good suspense and a solid mystery.<br />Recommended	2002-08-22
Loved it.	See storyline above.<br />With W. Michael Gear's masters in Physical Anthropology and Kathleen O'Neal Gear's work as historian and archaeology, you just know you'll get a highly fascinating story based on facts in science and biology, and with it, a lot of thrills. The kind of story I just love to read. There will be feathers ruffled with some of the facts/scientific theory, but as quoted in the book &quot;Sometimes extra measures were necessary to make the glazed-eyed acolytes of ignorance accept reality&quot;.<br />From Anthropological Geneticists (looking for the rosetta stone of evolution) to information on the Teshik-Tash, this book is loaded with thrills and science.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-08-14
A good mystery	See storyline above.<br /> When I started reading this book I knew it would be hard to put down. The writing style was compelling (this seems to be a popular word to describe the book) and the story was intriguing. Dr. Frank Clevenger though, is not one of my favorite characters. His quick addiction to Julia seemed not entirely in character for a professional and reputable psychiatrist, even though he describes himself as having \\"...wounds crisscrossing my psyche like a map to hell\\".<br />An overall entertaining mystery that will keep you guessing.<br />Recommended.	2002-08-08
Eye-opening	I borrowed a copy of this between novels and must say I truly enjoyed it. It was a rather eye-opening account of the world of cooking (Bourdain's world anyway). It was well written and held my attention. I would recommend young chefs in training pick up a copy. Though Bourdain's way to success is not the common way, it sure has been quite a ride so far. Since reading this, my view point of the cooking field has changed somewhat. When going into restaurants now, I find myself trying to sneak a peak into the kitchen to see if I can see any 'hijinks in progress'.<br />Recommended	2002-08-04
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Though not very original, this latest by Wiltse does in fact tell a good story and creates a greater depth to his protagonist Billy Tree (remember 'Heartland'). Billy seems to stumble around quite a bit in most of the book, missing alot of clues (e.g. the rabid dog) and shaking in his boots every time he sees or hears a gun. This of course gives him the human quality achieved in this novel. Wiltse's descriptions of the area are accurate and almost make you feel as if you're there, describing the heat and humidity, &quot;Like sitting in an oven, wrapped in a wet horse blanket&quot;. A good story that is sometimes too wordy, but moves at a steady moderate pace.	2002-08-04
Kingfisher's Call	See storyline above.<br />Tuck Nyland, the protagonist hero of this story, is one of those characters that seems to have nine lives. A sort of Dirk Pitt type. You know from the onset that nothing can kill this guy but you'll find yourself fretting over the characters that surround him. The novel is fast-paced and visually pleasing with it's locales. To me it had a less than pleasing ending.<br />An overall adventure that could have been a little more fulfilling, but still, I did enjoy it.<br />Recommended.	2002-07-28
Abridged CD	Though I normally don't listen to abridged books, I figured I'd pick this one up at the library and give it a go. I have always liked Mr. Fox and since it was also read by him I figured I would enjoy it. I did. From his confidence as a child to his courage as an adult, he seems like a real down to earth kind of guy that deserves admiration.<br /> I could only notice traces of a shaky voice during his narration and that seemed to be just on the first couple of cd's. A good abridgement and a good story. I wish you luck and hope the researchers find a cure real soon.<br />Highly Recommended	2002-07-27
4 1/2 stars.	See storyline above.<br />Repairman Jack returns in another great story by F. Paul Wilson. This time he must get the best of a haunted house, as well as a mysterious and powerful group of thirteen men who sacrifice young children in order to achieve longevity. Jack also delves into the world of the psychics and their scams.<br />This is no doubt a gripping and sometime scary novel that will keep you riveted to its pages. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the editing. Being filled with quite a few errors, Guantlet Publications should be blamed for this.<br />Still highly recommended.	2002-07-26
My vacation book	See storyline above.<br />This is the book I took on vacation--knowing I wouldn't have time to read much, I just took one--and I was very thrilled. this is my first Coben novel and I must say that I intend to put some of his past novels on my reading list. A twisting, turning, didn't see that coming, type of novel that will surprise and entertain most thriller readers. Well written with a lot of depth. It also goes to show that a protagonist, both cowardly and weak, can somehow end up on top.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-07-18
The Legacy	As a favor for his cousin, Joseph Antonelli leaves his Portland home and goes to San Francisco to defend a young black man who is accused of killing a United States Senator. The young man is a clean cut pre-med student at Berkeley. Antonelli believes that one of the Senator's powerful enemies is behind the murder.<br />D.W. Buffa has become one of my favorite legal thriller authors. His descriptions of San Francisco--which he seems to think is one of the best cities in the country--are vivid, and make an excellent background to this suspenseful thriller. Filled with riveting dialogue, along with quite a few surprises, I recommend this to all legal thriller fans.<br />Highly Recommended	2002-07-07
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Patterson's `Beach House' is one of his `just above' average efforts. Big money, crooked cops, search for the truth, and vengeance, combine to make this a fun summer read. There are a few surprises as well as a fast-paced plot that should please most Patterson fans. His typical short chapters make this an ideal beach house read.<br />Recommended for all Patterson fans.	2002-07-02
4 1/2 stars	When Bob Hansen, a successful author, and Doug Crowley, a middle of the road actor, set out on a hike, Bob begins to realize that he doesn't know Doug as well as he thought.<br />With a narrative that draws you in, Matheson's latest is a highly suspenseful novel that will make you read non-stop till the thrilling end. You'll be reminded very much of the movie `Deliverance' when you come to certain spots. Gruesome visuals and intense action make this a thriller you won't soon forget.<br />Recommended.	2002-06-30
Fair Bond	. See storyline above.<br />Raymond Benson's version of 007 is adequate. This time 007, in order to save the world, must find a deadly virus. This virus is a highly altered version of the West Nile virus.<br />Benson takes you through the beautiful country of Japan and its nearby provinces. You'll learn about the Japanese mafia. You'll be intrigued by some unusual customs practiced their. This was a bare bones thriller. Fast-paced and quick to read.<br />Recommended for the hardcore Bond fan	2002-06-28
good 4 star mystery	In Les Standiford's latest John Deal novel you get a solid mystery with characters you've become familiar with but still remain fresh. This time around Deal and his newly appointed construction engineer, Russell Straight, are heading down to Key West to discuss a business proposition with a big time developer that his father once knew. Obviously with Mister Deal involved, something bad usually happens, and this time it's no exception. His unfortunate run in with a young black hoodlum is just the start of a long hard stay in the Key's. Murder, along with an old tale of piracy drive this sometime suspenseful tale to its satisfying conclusion.<br />Recommended.	2002-06-23
Preston and Child come through again	See storyline above.<br />It's always a unique and satisfying experience to read a Preston and Child novel. This was no exception. Taking you through grotesqueries that are reminiscent of the House of Horrors to the edge of your seat suspense, this story and its science and history tidbits is top notch entertainment. Once again New York's Museum of Natural History (think `The Relic') is the main setting, and with this setting, you just never know what kind of surprises are in store.<br />Highly recommended	2002-06-13
Can't go wrong with Cussler	See storyline above.<br />Kurt Austin returns for another adventure that's sure to keep you pumped till the last page.<br />When Cussler teams with Kemprecos, you get the Dirk Pitt clone known as Kurt Austin. An original character on his own but still as tough as they come. This time around Austin and his regular partners-including Joe Zavala-- must stop a Russian mad man, who claims to be a Romanov descendent, from destroying the United States and becoming the new Tsar of Russia.<br />I am never disappointed with a Clive Cussler novel. The entertainment value is unbeatable. The subjects he writes about are well researched, as are the locales (Black Sea, Istanbul). Even though the good guys always miraculously win, it's still darn good storytelling.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-06-10
Red Rain	See storyline above.<br />Michael Crow, a pseudonym of an apparently popular author, has a writing style that draws you in to the story and makes you part of it. This is the story of Luther Ewing. Luther is presently a detective for the Baltimore County Police Department. His past is a mystery to most of his friends and involves the Gulf war and his experiences with the special forces. When out of his past comes a certain old Russian mercenary named Vassily. Vassily seems to be taking over the drug trade in Luther's district and in his path he leaves death and destruction. Luther soon realizes that the only way to defeat Vassily is to veer a little outside the law.<br />Though just an average thriller, the writing style and knowledge of weaponry give it an edge that's worth reading. I was bothered by the fact that Vassily didn't have a clue that Luther was a detective.<br />Recommended.	2002-06-05
Hilarious	See storyline above.<br />With a wide assortment of characters, including career criminal Serge A. Storms and his rag-tag partners, to the rather naïve Jim Davenport, a low level white collar worker who decides to accept a transfer to Tampa, we soon discover the wackiness that surrounds the mind of Tim Dorsey. This wickedly hilarious romp through a minefield of guffaws will make you wish the book will never end. If you're not smiling while reading this novel you're probably laughing. The four old ladies were a riot. I very much look forward to the next Dorsey novel and wouldn't mind seeing old Serge again.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-29
Great adventure	See storyline above.<br />John J Nance's newest novel is not only suspenseful but invigorating and downright addicting. This is one of his best adventures to date. Character driven non-stop suspense will keep you from putting this one down (I know that's a clich&eacute; but this book proves it). A well rounded thriller from an author one soon expects to see on the bestseller lists.<br />If you've ever flown, this will hit home.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-22
4 1/2 stars	I always enjoy reading a Michael Palmer novel because it always seems to combine controversial medical topics, along with thrills that will please all suspense fans.<br />  Matt Rutledge is a small town doctor in Belinda, WV. He believes the local mining company is causing illness and death (such as his wife's and father's), and is looking real hard for the reason to get the mine shut down. Not a real popular idea amongst the folks in town.<br />  Ellen Kroft is a retired school teacher who believes that a new vaccine that's being introduced nationwide (endorsed by the First Lady) is deadly.<br />  Nikki Solari, a coroner from Massachusetts, is in the town of Belinda to attend her best friend's funeral, when an attempt is made on her life. It seems she might have received some suspicious information about her best friend's death, and somebody wants that information real bad.<br />As these individuals come together in the story, you get a very exciting and suspenseful novel that should put Palmer on the top of his genre (I think he's already on the top). Lassa fever, Prion diseases and possible problems with vaccinations are just a few of the interesting topics covered. You'll enjoy many of the characters as well. I got a kick out of the dialogue with the mountain men.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-13
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />I will say one thing for sure, this is a one day read. Not because it was good, but because there is a lot you can glance over and still not miss anything. Morrell seems to have become a bit subdued with this latest thriller, wich includes a few suspenseful parts and a lot of filler. With the quality of writing that Morrell has had in the past though, I'm not about to let his next novel go without reading it, hoping it's as good as his previous books.	2002-05-09
Mortal Allies	I've definitely become a fan of Brian Haig's with this latest (second) novel.<br /><br />The South Korean Defense Minister's son is brutally murdered and raped. The people whom stand accused for this heinous crime are three US military men. Katherine Carlson, a highly intelligent and cunning civilian attorney, is representing one of the accused, a Thomas Whitehall, who doesn't stand much of a chance since the other two will testify against him. Katherine requests Major Sean Drummond to be the military co-council. Drummond takes on the job with some reservations. When Drummond was in law school, Katherine was a classmate and they constantly fought like cats and dogs. Never did they get along. So needless to say Drummond is quite baffled as to her choice of co-council. It turns out the case goes beyond just the murder and rape.<br />Brian Haig's witty first person narrative and a fast-paced story line, gets the reader highly involved and makes this a very good novel. The South Korean setting and gays in the military are two prominent themes in the story. A great military legal thriller.<br />Highly recommended	2002-05-06
Quick and witty	See storyline above.<br />If you're looking for a somewhat short novel with quick and witty dialogue in a humorous crime caper genre, this will satisfy. The character of Francis Meehan is very likeable as is the not so quick witted Pat Jeffords (the Fed that Meehan is doing the job for). An easy to read and easy to follow story that is not real involved.<br />Recommended	2002-04-28
Top notch thriller	It's novels like this that keep R.J. Pineiro on top of my `must read' thriller list.<br />Bruce Tucker is ex-Navy Seal, ex-Secret Service and Ex-CIA operative. After losing his family to terrorists, which he also blames on the CIA, Tucker takes the job of protector/bodyguard to one of the richest computer gurus alive (think Gates) named Mortimer Fox. When Fox has a heart attack, after a failed attempt on his life, he passes on to Tucker a couple secrets and asks him to please protect his daughter. The same powerful forces that have been trying to kill him will now go after her. The big secret (Firewall) behind Mortimer Fox is a technology, which if discovered by another country, could trigger Armageddon. From launch codes to all the coded messages between intelligence agencies, nothing can be kept secret if the code to Firewall is acquired.<br />As much spy thriller as techno thriller. A better-rounded thriller you couldn't ask for. From computer technology to the possibilities of a North Korean invasion, all play a pivotal role in this non-stop thriller. At times it gets graphic (Cannibalism) and violent, but in the situations presented it's appropriate and not over done. This novel is very satisfying and should create some new fans for R.J. Pineiro.<br />Highly Recommended.	2002-04-27
3 1/2 stars	...P>This had the potential to be an outstanding novel. The plot and storyline about plagues and life ending disasters combined with the biological sciences of cloning and genetics, along with a dose of pre-history, should spell bestseller. This one disappoints a bit. I didn't like the somewhat blocky writing style or lack of continuity. Though the story was very interesting, it just didn't grab me like a good thriller should. I really wanted to like this novel more. Maybe next time.<br />Recommended for the sci-fi buff.	2002-04-22
Best thriller this year	International thrillers do not get any better than this.<br />The main plot of this suspenseful novel involves the rebel leader of a group known as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). They call her the Dragon. This group is trying to overrun the Sierra Leone government. The Dragon's subsequent plan is then to destroy the USA with a secret weapon known as the Black Death (not the Black Death you're familiar with either). Ben Kamal and Danielle Barnea, in a most unusual way, get back together in an effort to stop the Dragon and her secret weapon. Of course this is just one of their problems. Old enemies also return.<br />The story also has numerous subplots that each come together to make this one of the most satisfying thrillers I've read in some time. From the civil war in Sierra Leone to the secret weapons factory in Russia, this novel carries you non-stop from beginning to end. The timely subject of the Middle East also plays a prominent role.<br />Quote: You do this out of hate for the enemy, not love of the people.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-04-10
Midnight Runner	Jack Higgins returns again with his usual bunch of characters.<br />This time around it's Lady Kate Rashid's turn to seek vengeance on the President of the USA as well as Sean Dillon and others. It seems her three brothers were killed attempting to assassinate the president (Edge of Danger). Kate Rashid is one the richest women in the world and thus, has the power to get what she wants. Needless to say, she has no idea what she's soon to come up against: Sean Dillon, Blake Johnson, Harry and Billy Salter, Roper, Daniel Quinn and others.<br />A fast-paced thriller. The character of Sean Dillon is reminding me more and more of a character by the name of Dirk Pitt. You thriller readers know whom I'm talking about. Somehow you just know that no task is impossible. Of course Dirk still rules. This novel was comparable to the previous Dillon novels.<br />A suspenseful and quick read.<br />Recommended	2002-04-08
4 1/2 stars	This being the first Mike Stewart book I've read, my goal will now be to read his previous Tom McInnes novels.<br />This time around McInnes gets hired by Sheri Baneberry. Sheri's mother was serving on a jury when she mysteriously died of what seemed to be salmonella poisoning. What Sheri wants to find out is whose fault it was. As McInnes and his partner, Joey, start researching the mother's death bad things start happening. Tom's life is now in danger. He gets blackmailed for murder and he also becomes disbarred. As he gets closer to the truth, death gets closer to him. With the help of an Asian-American doctor (psychology) who soon becomes a close female companion, and Joey, his trusting investigator, Tom works his magic and soon discovers the truth.<br />Stewart's way with words makes this novel one heck of a good read. A strong descriptive narrative invites one to visit Mobile, Alabama even in the dead of winter. A well plotted, fast moving story that I really enjoyed.<br />Highly Recommended.	2002-04-04
A different sort of mystery	I didn't get a chance to read `Shooting Elvis', but I certainly enjoyed this latest Nina Zero novel.<br />Nina Zero, out on parole after serving five years in prison, has a deal set up to marry an Englishman for two thousand dollars, so he can have his green card. She agrees because she obviously needs the money. Little does she know the trouble she's getting into. Her husband is found murdered, and it seems to be because of some pictures he's taken. Having been a paparazzo, her dead husband seems to have made some powerful enemies. She's not afraid to find out who they might be.<br />A well written mystery. The dialogue as well as the narration kept my attention on the story.<br />Recommended.	2002-04-01
Average Patterson	See storyline above.<br />Reading a James Patterson novel is no doubt easy as well as quick, but it does provide an overall good mystery/procedural. The first person perspective of a female protagonist by a male author still throws me off a bit at the beginning, but soon I forget about it. As mentioned, the book moves fast. With it's short chapters and the brief hints it provides in most of them, it was an enjoyable read.<br />I wonder what Andrew Gross contributed.<br />Recommended	2002-03-31
Top notch entertainment	This is one heck of an adventure. As far as entertainment is concerned, James Rollins will fulfill your needs.<br />Nathan Rand is the main protagonist. He has lost both his mother and father to the dangerous Amazon. The government would like his help in finding the trail his father took four years ago. It seems a member of his father's original team has shown up alive after four years, but lives just long enough to say a few words to a shaman in a small Amazonian village. He also had a real arm in place of one that was amputated several years earlier. There is something out there that could change the world. Nathan's team includes Army Rangers as well as a group of scientists. The obstacles encountered will leave no man unscarred.<br />I just love stories like this. High adventure in the vain of Indiana Jones. The writing was so vivid it was like watching the big screen. It has fantasy with sci-fi, it has horror and mutations, and it covers the sciences from archeology to biology to evolution. Jaguars, anacondas, black caimans, piranhas, black ants, and one of the most vicious creatures, a woman called Tshui, are all part of the dangers (at least the normal dangers).<br />You'll enjoy this escape to the dangerous Amazon.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-03-29
A thrilling story	Jeffrey Deaver's latest tops all his previous works, in a story that's well worth your time.<br />Lincoln Rhyme's talent as a criminologist is highly sought after. This time around the INS, FBI and NYPD are using his expertise in capturing an infamous snakehead nicknamed the `Ghost'. Snakeheads are \\"smugglers crawling furtively through borders to deliver human cargo\\". When the `Ghost' destroys and sinks a ship carrying his cargo of Chinese dissidents--in an attempt to kill all on board-- Rhyme and his girlfriend Amelia Sachs, an NYPD officer, go in search of this mysterious criminal. Working with a philosophical Chinese police officer that survived the sinking, they discover that there are survivors and that the `ghost' is out to kill them.<br />Rhymes and Sachs's work with the crime scenes alone makes this top notch entertainment. The story of illegal Chinese immigrants and the reasons and hardships of some of their travels are somewhat eye-opening. The suspense and the mystery, as well as the unexpected turns, should help give this book, in my opinion, a spot on your shelf.<br />Highly recommended	2002-03-23
4 1/2 star thriller	See storyline above.<br />Daniel Silva's latest brings back the art restorer/Israeli spy Gabriel Allon. It will leave little to be desired when it comes to international intrigue.<br />This time Gabriel ends up trying to find stolen paintings that were taken from the Jews during WW2. With the help of a rather accident prone pianist named Anna Rolfe, Gabriel treks all across Europe searching for these elusive paintings while avoiding assassins and the Swiss secret service. Secret documents and secret councils are just some of the surprises in this fast-paced international spy thriller. Silva paints a rather dark picture when it comes to Switzerland and their possible involvement with the Nazis and stolen treasures. A well researched novel with an ending that wasn't totally satisfying.<br />Daniel Silva is definitely one of the top thriller writers. Keep it up.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-03-17
Warning Signs	See storyline above.<br />Stephen White's latest is a psychological drama well worth your time. The characters seem real and the two subplots come together real well. There is suspense along with quite a few ethical dilemmas. A well-written and solid novel.<br />Inside the covers:  \\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That is his.\\" A quote by Oscar Wilde<br />Recommended	2002-03-13
A good first novel	A good first novel by Alan Fields.<br />Eddie Spinola is a copywriter working for Kerr and Dexter Publishing. One day while walking down the street he runs into his ex-brother-in-law. It's been about ten years since they've seen each other, so they chatted a bit. The next thing you know Eddie is given a pill to try. This `supposed' smart pill apparently does make him smarter but it also has some deleterious side effects. Death seems to surround this drug whether it's murder or the side effects.<br />The first half of the book seemed to move rather slowly, but the second half picked up the pace and made the book well worth the read. The whole concept of a smart drug was very intriguing. Eddie Spinola's character was likable but I didn't really care if anything happened to him. He was naïve about the drugs side effects and thinking ahead. The ending was left somewhat open. A good first novel with a not so good cover.<br />Recommended	2002-03-05
4 1/2 stars	All I can say is with Reilly you can expect one heck of a ride.<br />In this latest non-stop adventure, Shane Scofield is back (previous outing was in `Ice Station'). When the President decides to visit a top-secret base in the desert, known as Area 7, he stumbles upon some secrets he didn't even know about. Basically what happens is a large group of military soldiers from an elite squad in the Air Force take over Area 7 and kill almost everyone who is in charge of protecting the president. The mastermind behind this wants the president dead and has created a little game in which the president stands little chance of winning. Once the presidents heart stops beating, a device that was implanted, unknowingly, in his heart years ago, will cause a series of explosions (blast plasma warheads) at many of the busiest airports around the country. Needless to say, Scofield is one of the few survivors after the initial onslaught.<br />Matthew Reilly was quoted as saying that he likes to write \\"about action, thrills and adventure, and if developing characters slows down the action, then developing characters gets the chop\\". This is it in a nutshell. First suspend your beliefs, because when you get a hold of this relentlessly paced book it won't let up. It even comes with illustrations in case you don't have time to think. From chases in space to chases in lake Powell to the idea of racial viruses, it's a tremendously fun mindless read.<br />Highly recommended strictly for fun.	2002-02-23
4 1/2 stars of fun	See the booklist summary above.<br />This latest suspense yarn from Lysaght involves multiple genres. From international terrorism and arms trading to police procedural to Russian and Italian mafias. It's kind of a complicated story (a lot of characters) so if you lay the book down and don't pick it up for a week you'll probably forget who's who. I read it in two days and must say I really enjoyed it. Not a dull moment. Violence, action, vengeance, and some humorous dialogue drive this suspense-ridden novel to a satisfying conclusion. If you want to spend some of your leisure time with some exciting fast-paced reading, this novel will not disappoint you.<br />Highly recommended	2002-02-18
Great adventure!	Paul Garrison just seems to get better and better with each novel. With his knowledge of the sea and his vivid writing style he's sure to please a wide range of readers looking for a great adventure.<br />Jim Leighton is a spin/aerobics instructor at a fitness center that is owned by his girlfriend's father. He is asked to be a personal trainer and deckhand for a man named Will Clark, a rich venture capitalist that is planning a trip to South America. Jim accepts the job because his girlfriend would like him to get out and have a little adventure before they get married. He got more than he asked for. It turns out that a very powerful group is after Clark and a secret he holds, and will stop at nothing to capture him.  The wild ride begins.<br />I am very impressed with this newest Garrison novel. A nonstop adventure around the world including stops in Nigeria, Buenos Aires, and the Falklands. Abundant in action, drama, suspense, high-tech gadgetry, and even a little humor. A very satisfying and well-rounded story as well. Keep up the good work Paul.<br />Highly recommended	2002-02-16
3 1/2 stars	When John Grisham comes out with a new book you just know the people will go out of their way to get it. I think after reading this one, the flock will dwindle.<br />Ray Atlee is the protagonist. He is a divorced professor at a prestigious university. He and his brother Forrest, who is an alcohol and drug addict, are summoned to their father's home to discuss his will. When they arrive they find their father dead with a recently signed one-page will that splits the estate in half between the two brothers. When Forrest leaves, Ray stumbles upon over 3 million dollars in cash hidden in boxes in the house. Needless to say, this money brings Ray more trouble than pleasure.<br />Grisham's effort seems to have waned here. From the boring protagonist to the dry storyline. Not to beat a dead horse but was this written in a month?	2002-02-14
A Winter Haunting	Dan Simmons latest foray into horror with this sequel to `Summer of Night' will give you the chills. It reminds me a lot of Stephen King type horror.<br />Dale Stewart is an English professor, rugged westerner and a published author. After a love affair ends (not his choice), he becomes deeply depressed, suffering what he calls `the black dog', a term for depression coined by Winston Churchill. He returns to his childhood home in a small Illinois town to write a book about his childhood. Renting an abandoned childhood friends house, a friend who died in mysterious circumstances when he was eleven years old, some really strange things start to happen. Stewart starts to wonder whether he's going crazy or if these weird things are actually happening. Giant black dogs. Seeing dead people. Neo Nazis. Okay, the Nazis could be real.<br />I have not read the first book that takes place in the summer of 1960/61, where they are young kids. I think this book stands well by itself. I might have gotten more out of it if I'd read the first though.<br />It is written in a very stylish and enthralling way. There comes a point in the book where you as the reader, are not sure what's real and what isn't. You don't always know if the character is really that crazy or not. Is it reality or psychological? You'll have to decide.<br />Recommended	2002-02-12
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />After reading Katzenbach's last novel `Harts War', I decided to put him on my must read list. After reading `The Analyst' I've decided to keep him on my list, but he will be moved closer to the bottom. The book is a deep psychological thriller. A highly detailed look at the psyche of one man. I will agree that the story had me hooked, but I had to read through many pages that described nothing but feelings. Is it fast-paced? No. Is it a story with a lot of depth? Yes. I still recommend this as a good thriller because it tells a good story, even though it is a little verbose.	2002-02-09
Basket Case	I wasn't disappointed with this newest from Hiaasen. I think it was breathtakingly fresh and well written.<br />Once upon a time, Jack Tagger was an ace reporter, now he's a 46 year-old obituary writer for a small Florida daily. He's assigned to write up an obit for one Jimmy Stoma (accidental death by drowning), lead singer for the old Jimmy and the Slut Puppies band; (this band had some song titles that went quite well with the band's name). While getting more information on the old band and talking to the widow, Tagger soon finds out that things are not as they seem. While investigating what he thinks is a murder, he also has to deal with his editor, who seems to be looking for a reason to fire him.<br />With the unique characters (Tagger's \\"loony death phobias\\") and the humorous dialogue created by Hiaasen, this book was a joy to read. I'll agree that it wasn't his funniest novel, but I still broke out in smile at times.<br />Highly Recommended.	2002-02-03
3 1/2 stars	I was a little disappointed in this latest from Tim Green. It was a little dry and not highly believable.<br />Kurt Ford is an ex Secret Service agent that used to protect Carter and Reagan. He is now a billionaire and founder of Safe-Tech, a very successful high-tech company. When his son, also a Secret Service agent, is found with a bullet in his head, Kurt is absolutely devastated.  The police believe it was suicide and don't intend to put any time in on the investigation. Kurt knows for a fact it was murder. He goes to an acquaintance of his who is working for the Secret Service and tries to get his help in getting information (This friend is also the man whom Kurt did not want working for him in his new company). With information this man gives him, Kurt is convinced that the president is responsible for his son's death. So Kurt decides to kill the president.<br />While a lot of the book deals with the emotional issues between Kurt and his fianc&eacute;, brought on by his son's death, some of the story deals in suspense. I felt the story was too predictable. From the beginning I knew who was behind the murders and that made the whole story frustrating. Kurt's gullibility didn't help. I've read all Tim Green's books and this is my least favorite...	2002-02-01
Good couch read	Bill Press's latest spin on spin will not only open your eyes but give you a good idea about the nature of politics, as well as other fields such as media, law, and advertising. Press calls it something between the truth and a lie. It all depends on when and how you use it. Press is slightly left of center but gives a fairly even handed jab to all sides. Giving Clinton his due as the master of spin, followed closely by Bush (in politics).<br />A quote from the book about what makes news;<br />&quot;In his masterful biography of Hearst, David Nasaw explains the famous publisher's guiding principal: &quot;News is not a phenomenon that exists in the real world, waiting to be discovered...An event becomes news only when journalists and the editors decide to record it. More often than not, what determines whether an occurrence is noteworthy or not is the ease with which it can be plotted and narrated so that readers will want to read about it.&quot; Thus spin feeds the beast of corporate-driven journalists.&quot;<br />I'll leave you with one example of spin from the book:<br />Spin: &quot;I'm just an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own making.&quot;<br />--Linda Tripp<br />Translation: I'm going to get a book deal and I'll rat on my friend to do it.<br />Recommended	2002-01-26
Average	`The Day Trader'is Stephen Frey's latest foray into the financial thriller. Not his best but still quite enjoyable.<br />When Augustus McKnight gets lucky on one of his stocks and makes a significant profit he thinks it'll make things all better for him and  his wife. Wrong. Before he gets a chance to say anything she tells him she's leaving him and wants a divorce-it seems there is a greener pasture with her boss. The next day she is found murdered. He will be the beneficiary of a one million dollar life insurance policy taken out six months earlier. So he quits his regular job and decides to become a full time day trader. Needless to say there is a detective on his case as well as an insurance investigator. Now for some reason this seems very surprising to the, obviously very naïve, Augustus.<br />With some neat twists and turns, Frey has written an entertaining novel. The biggest flaw in this book (fairly significant) is the protagonist. Through most of the novel I could not have cared less about Augustus. As mentioned by other reviews, and to put it plainly, he was just too dumb to care about.<br />I kept waiting for him to get smart but the book ended before I got there.<br />Though the novel tells you a little about trading, it mostly deals with the murder mystery.	2002-01-23
4 1/2 stars	I always look forward to the latest Meltzer novel and this, again, was no disappointment.<br />Charlie and Oliver Caruso, two brothers working for Greene and Greene, a private bank that requires a minimum of 2 million dollars to open an account, stumble upon an abandoned account containing 3 million dollars. In what they think is a foolproof plan, they talk themselves into stealing it. Well it wasn't foolproof. First of all, when they transfer the 3 million they receive quite a shock when they look at their deposit. Secondly a friend of theirs is shot and they are blamed. In the meantime two rogue secret service agents are after them as is a private investigator. How do you try to clear your name if indeed you're guilty?<br />I really enjoyed this fast-paced thriller. Of course, like everyone else, I thought of Grisham when reading this. Better than the new Grisham, comparable to the old. Laced with some humorous dialogue and some surprising twists. I think lovers of the thriller will like this one. Disneyland was a Hoot. The secret service's roll in this novel took me somewhat by surprise.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-22
4 1/2 stars	As a first novel I really enjoyed Brad Thor's 'The Lions of Lucerne'. It's a good international thriller that will remind you of early Ludlum.<br />Secret service agent Scot Harvath, an ex Navy Seal, is the only agent to survive an elaborate kidnapping of the president of the United States while on a skiing vacation in Utah. Though he saved the President's daughter, he also feels it's his duty to find out who was behind this very well thought out kidnapping, even if it means stepping on some toes and breaking some rules. The power behind the kidnappings eventually frame Harvath and soon everybody is looking for him.<br />Brad Thor has created a very visual thriller. His location descriptions are clear and accurate. From Lucerne to Bern, Thor takes you on an exciting, heart-pounding adventure. His super hero, Harvath, is sure to return for another adventure, which I certainly look forward to. If you like political intrigue and international thrills, I think you'll truly enjoy this first novel by Thor.	2002-01-13
4 1/2 stars. Fascinating	If you're looking for a good biography on Howard R Hughes, look no further, because this is the one you'll want. Richard Hack writes in an open and laid-back manner making it all easy to enjoy and absorb. The subject manner certainly makes for entertaining reading itself. This most noted of eccentrics will captivate you as well as disgust you. Hack takes you inside the Hughes empire and paints a very good picture of the how and why of his world. If not for Hughes inheritance from his father-owner of the Hughes Tool Co-you most likely will never have heard of Howard Hughes. Basically Howard himself had no business acumen. His life does read somewhat like a fairy tale in that most of the things he wished for he got. From movie starlets to hotels and casinos. Money can truly buy most things. Unfortunately he wasn't psychologically stable for the last half of his life and this caused him and those around him much misery. Form whatever opinion you like about Hughes, but after reading this biography, the opinion you form will be a strong one. It was a well-written biography that lagged just a little on the editing.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-07
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />James W. Hall writes a great thriller and I also think this is one of his best.<br />From it's dramatic opening to its satisfying conclusion, `Blackwater Sound' paints a riveting picture of southern Florida. Thorn, a laid back individual that seems to attract trouble like a magnet attracts steel, returns in another very satisfying novel of adventure.<br />Halls dialogue and narrative paint a vivid picture. The locales of Southern Florida along with the characters, makes this a very `hard to put down' book.<br />Highly recommended	2002-01-02
Shane's back	Stephen J. Cannell brings back Shane Scully from his previous adventure in â~The Tin Collectorsâ.<br />Scully lost his best friend and co-worker a couple years ago to an apparent suicide and it hit him pretty hard mentally. He is now suspended from the LAPD. While driving down the freeway, he has no doubt that who he sees is his dead best friend Jody Dean. Scullyâs fiancÃ©e, Alexa, who happens to also be with the LAPD and is a recent Medal of Valor recipient, thinks Scully has lost his mind. Soon more evidence comes into play and it turns out that Scully was right. There is a group of rogue policemen, some of whom have faked there deaths, that are taking the law into there own hands, as well as making there own laws. Scully infiltrates this group.  On the outside, Alexa is handling things.<br />Cannell takes you into the world of money laundering, drugs, and murder, while taking you into the deadly locales of South America. It was an entertaining and easy book to read. Itâs not hard to picture a movie out of this story (obviously due to Cannellâs scriptwriting abilities). Good entertainment.<br />Recommended	2001-12-30
3 1/2 stars	Haynes Johnson’s latest work takes you into the nineties. A decade where the market soared and technology boomed. A decade when scandal seemed to be on everyone’s mind and on everyone’s TV.<br />A good portion of this book involves Clinton and his escapades. Other portions talk about technology and its affect on everything from the sciences, where the genome is being mapped, to the Internet, and its web over the country.  The popularity of scandal TV and reality TV get quite a bit of mention also. From the O.J. debacle to the Monica story. Is it the dumbing down of the media for the public or the other way around?<br />Johnson has summarized the nineties fairly well. This brief history covers quite a bit of territory and is written in a concise and readable way.<br />If you’ve kept up with the times, you won’t learn anything new here, but it will bring back some either good or bad memories.	2001-12-26
Fun read	See storyline above.<br />William Bernhardt leads of this novel with the first chapter, in a collaborative work of fiction sure to entertain. The uniqueness lies in the fact that each of the authors didn’t know the storyline until it was his/her turn to write a chapter. When the author is finished with his/her chapter, he sends it on to the next.<br />The end result is a fun and entertaining mystery written by some very talented writers (see above). The novel was written more for fun and should be read with this in mind. If you want a quick and entertaining read that has a lot of humor and surprises, this is it.<br />Recommended for all mystery lovers with a flair for fun.	2001-12-20
Bent Fender	See storyline above.<br />When Bill Fitzhugh writes a book, you never know what you’re going to get. This time around he writes a somewhat scathing story of Nashville and the country music industry.<br />It seems as though Fitzhugh’s novels are becoming progressively less funny (laugh out loud). They may be less funny but the stories are still fun to read. Even though this story has no laugh out loud parts it is dosed with some little humorous gems (Jimmy’s description of a Gulf Coast casino as feeling like he was in a Dukes of Hazard pinball machine). Fender Benders is an entertaining and eye opening look at the workings of the country music industry and will make you look at Nashville in a whole new light.<br />Recommended.	2001-12-19
Jackdaws	Ken Follettâs latest novel â~Jackdawsâ(I love this title)turns to WW2 and a little known organization that goes by the acronym SOE.<br />Itâs the week before D-Day. 28-year-old Felicity â~Flickâ Clairet, an agent for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which specializes in sabotage behind enemy lines, is in charge of destroying an important telephone exchange station in France. After the first mission fails she returns to London to look for recruits for a brave new plan that will take them into the exchange itself. These recruits will be comprised of nothing but females (and quite a group this turns out to be).<br />Dieter Franck is the German, working under Rommel, who is set out to stop the resistance movement. He soon becomes Flickâs archenemy. Dieter is a skilled interrogator and a ruthless torturer who has a knack of getting the truth out of his enemies.<br />The cat and mouse scenario between Flick and Dieter drives this novel to its very satisfying conclusion. It has an odd assortment of characters, some youâll like and some youâll hate. This is not one of Follettâs more memorable novels but it is still worth your time if youâre a fan. The plot didnât really draw me in until the second half of the book, and thatâs when it grabbed hold and wouldnât let go. I will continue to be a Follett fan.<br />Recommended.	2001-12-13
4 1/2	Baldacci returns to his starting form thriller, but this time he throws in a little more emotion and feeling and takes away a little more action.<br />Web London is a 37-year-old HRT specialist for the FBI. He is well respected and thought of as a hero. On his latest mission this all changes. He has unknowingly led his squad of 6 into an ambush and they are all killed. He survived. The bad thing is, he froze before entry and he doesn’t know why. This squad included his many good friends. Few know the truth, but most look at him as somewhat of a coward, including the media. His personal job now is to find out who was behind this ambush. Was it a group of neo nazis?  Could it have been the local drug kingpin?<br />Many different issues are touched on in this well-rounded thriller. The character study of Web London is lengthy and in depth. Yes, in this thriller Baldacci gets more touchy-feely than his other thrillers, but this also is a bonus in that it adds depth --great depth-- to the character. The challenges of the HRT (hostage rescue team), of the FBI are touched on and quite interesting. A satisfying story with some unique characters.<br />Highly recommended for Baldacci fans as well as thriller fans.	2001-12-08
A quick satisfying read	Bonita Wagner's latest novel, though short, is a fast and satisfying read.<br />It's the latest fad drug and it's called 'Boomers'. It's highly addictive. Teenage girls are being talked into trying it, and when they get hooked, they gladly sell there bodies for more. When a bad batch gets out, lives are lost. Mostly young teenagers. This is when Texas rangers' Travis and Manny get on the case.<br />The story should be aimed at parents and teenagers. A rather moral tale that describes some of the perils of teenage drug use. There is suspense to go with the emotion. It's also laced with humor, especially when it comes to Manny and Travis. Being a short novel, as this was, it did lack some depth but it still kept me in my chair.	2001-12-05
Noir	See storyline above.<br />If you like your fiction somewhat noirish, you'll simply enjoy this latest offer from Richard Stark. Parker returns. This time, with an assortment of criminals chasing him, he's trying to help put together a plan to steal some valuable paintings from a billionaire's lodge in the mountains of Montana. Parker has a tendency to get what he wants. He's smart and fast and he makes for entertaining reading. This rather short novel provides a perfect day's reading, and with Stark's writing style, one day  is what you'll probably do it in.<br />Recommended	2001-11-29
World without end	See storyline above<br />If you can keep track of whos who in this technological thriller, you'll greatly enjoy this book. A fun thrilling ride. It features a wide assortment of bad guys, each with there own little quirks. Along with the sometime graphic violence, you'll get the adrenaline inducing action. Though the writing is not always smooth, it will make you want to finish the book quickly.<br />Recommended	2001-11-26
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Being Jim Brownâs first novel, I must say he sure came out with a bang! The originality of the story is timely. A reality show gone haywire, where people actually die. Hmmm. I sure hope this doesnât give the producers out there something to mull over. After all this was real â~survivorâ. It was, without a doubt, a very entertaining story. Action, mystery, and a little lovinâ, will keep the reader racing to the end to solve the mystery. The writing style was good, but I think will improve with another novel or two under his belt. I think Jim Brown will become an author to keep an eye on.<br />Highly Recommended for younger adults	2001-11-23
A good thriller	David Owens is a 32-year-old attorney in San Antonio who has just won an important divorce settlement case. This was only his fifth trial. Three weeks later he is surprised by a visit from the First Lady of the United States, Myra McPherson. She wants a divorce and she wants Owens to represent her and her 8-year-old son. Needless to say, this opens up a whole can of worms. First off, the president wants his family back in the White House, as do some other powerful interests. Secondly it seems that young Randy, the first couple’s son, knows something he shouldn’t and this scares some very powerful people.<br />This was a well-paced thriller. Filled with thrills and surprises. The premise seemed a little stretched at times, but it was still a fairly good read.<br />Cute quote from inside the covers:<br />“If you beat an enemy, you’ve just made an even worse enemy. But if you turn your enemy into your friend, then you’ll have a friend you can never really trust.”<br />Recommended	2001-11-20
A great final novel	See storyline above.<br />Robert Ludlum’s international thrillers are relentless. This last novel will not disappoint.<br />Ben Hartman, a 36-year-old investment banker with a big heart, (he volunteers as a teacher to under privileged and troubled fifth graders) is traveling through Zurich on his way to St. Moritz. While outside his hotel he spots an old friend from college he hasn’t seen in some 15 years. As he makes his way to greet his old friend, the friend pulls a gun and tries to kill him. So begins Hartman’s adventure.<br />This highly entertaining international thriller is one of Ludlum’s best. More like his earlier works, yet there is quite a bit of originality and uniqueness to this one. With exciting locales such as Vienna, Buenos Aires, Zurich and Paris, it’s hard to get bored. This is a well-plotted story involving a conspiracy so powerful (Sigma), nobody is beyond its grasp. It seems much of Ludlum’s wisdom, as well as research, went into this novel. An interesting story that will raise your eyebrows as well as your adrenaline. A very entertaining novel.<br />Inside the covers:<br />“An extraordinary undertaking requires extraordinary resources”<br />“For a good cause, wrongdoing is virtuous”<br />Highly recommended	2001-11-16
4 1/2 stars	Dan Brown's latest scientific thriller doesn't quite match his last thriller (Angels and Demons), though it comes darn close.<br />As NASA's failure rate is high and it's popularity low, a much needed boost--to it's reputation--has been discovered. A NASA satellite orbiting over the Artic discovers a meteorite buried deep in the ice. It turns out that this could be the discovery of the century, for within this meteorite are numerous fossils resembling giant insects thought to have originated on another planet. Rachel Sexton (Daughter of a Senator who is out to destroy NASA and gain the presidency) works for the White House and is sent to the Artic to verify the meteorites authenticity. Rachel, working along with scientists, soon discovers some amazing facts. She also learns that nothing is as it seems.<br />Brown's Novels are always top notch entertainment. His characters highly likeable (Michael Tolland Reminded me of Bill Nye the science guy) and his research impeccable. The different subjects in this book covered things like Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), physics of glaciers and meteorites, the theory of Panspermia and the story behind megaplumes. The controversial subject of privatizing space exploration was also heavily written about.<br />Exciting, educating, and highly enjoyable. A topnotch thriller.<br />Highly recommended	2001-11-10
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />I think this time around Phillip Margolin slipped a bit. More a murder mystery than legal thriller. Margolin's story of a young associate will keep you reading at a steady pace, because if you don't read this in one or two sittings, you're apt to forget who certain characters are. I think Margolin's previous novels put this one to shame. This novel was just a little to short to accomodate this type of story line. It needed more depth to the story and the characters.<br />Recommended for Margolin fans.	2001-11-07
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Stephen Hunter brings Earl Swagger back after his Hot Springs adventure. If you think Swagger had a tough time in Hot Springs, wait till you get a load of this story.<br />This time around Swagger is called on to help his friend Sam Vincent, an ex-prosecutor from Arkansas, who is being held captive at a secret Prison farm in Thebes, Arkansas. Thebes Prison Farm is run by ruthless men in the swamps of Mississippi. A subplot includes the investigation of a secret Army research project that ties in with the Farm.<br />Filled with surprises and evil twists, this violent and sometimes cruel look at life on the Farm, will make you race to the end of the story where you know justice will prevail. The gettin' even part will make you cheer.<br />Hunter fans will love this one. A Well plotted and well told thriller taking place in the racial turmoil of Mississippi in the 1950's.<br />Highly recommended	2001-11-04
The Devil's Country	See Storyline above.<br />Well it’s good to see Clive Barker back with another epic tale. This time around it revolves around Hollywood. The old and the new. Barker’s stories generally involve all sorts of depravities. This one definitely has its share. Explicit sex, along with stunning and shocking visuals, lets you know you’re reading a Barker novel. Barker seems to create a great depth to his stories, and this is no exception. A ghost story that portrays Hollywood as a sort of sexual asylum. The talent that Barker has in bringing you into his fantasy worlds exceeds that of most contemporary horror writers, as well as most novelists. The violence as well as the sexual explicitness (nothing forbidden), will bring out a weird range of emotions in the reader, so beware.<br />Highly recommended, even though I liked the UK cover much better.	2001-11-02
Good, not the best	See storyline above.<br />In this Repairman Jack novel we learn a bit more about his family. His divorced lesbian sister is the one in need of repair on this go round, though Joe and Stan, the arsonists from a previous novel, do make a rather large cameo appearance (and then disappearance).<br /> I usually rate Wilson's novels with five stars, but this just didn't have the oomph I'm used too. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, it lacked certain repairs. Sure there was suspense, and it sure moved at a quick pace, but this supernatural thriller didn't have quite enough closure. I will, of course, read the next novel in this series, with just a little apprehension, not much, just a little. I think the editors at Forge slipped a little bit also with some of the spelling. One more gripe. There is no microwave oven, in home, that will run 99 hours.<br />Still highly recommended...because it's F. Paul Wilson.	2001-10-26
4 1/2 stars	Atticus Kodiak, a name you won’t soon forget after reading this fast moving thriller from the mind of Greg Rucka.<br />The pursuer becomes the pursued and the assassin becomes the target. Drama is the code name of one of the top assassins in the world belonging to a group known as The Ten. Atticus Kodiak is the only man alive that has bested her. Now Drama is being targeted by another dangerous assassin known as Oxford, and would like Atticus to protect her. Her scheme to get Atticus’s help is no less than genius. Once he relents and decides to help, she trains him and teaches him everything she knows about survival in the world of assassins. Training he will need to survive.<br />I really liked this book. It was fast paced with adventures in international locales. It had likeable characters with depth. The story gave you a good idea about the job of bodyguard as well as some secrets of the assassins. A thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-23
Barely 4 stars	Richard Whelan, an African American, is National Security Advisor to the President.  When he and his white girlfriend get into a fight at a party, they decide that he should follow her home to get his things out of her apartment. On the way there, he is pulled over, by what he thinks are the police, and beaten. He makes it to the apartment and discovers his girlfriend’s dead body. He calls 911, and before the police show up, he is called back to the White House for an emergency meeting. Him leaving the scene was the biggest mistake he ever made--and really doesn’t make much sense either. Whelan is framed for the murder and soon becomes the victim of numerous frame-ups. Being pursued by the CIA and the Secret Service as well as the Washington Police, our hero Whelan must escape capture, and at the same time try to diffuse an international incident involving China, Pakistan, and India.<br />Shallow characters don’t seem to put too much of a damper on the action and fast-paced narrative.<br />With some more time under his belt. I think Fullimore will become quite a good thriller writer.	2001-10-19
So-So	After reading all the rave reviews for this book, I decided I would give it a read. Not a bad story but nothing I would go out of the way to recommend.<br />Billy Strobe came from a rather broken family. His father was a good attorney but committed suicide when Billy was 12. His mother is an alcoholic and his sister has MS. While his mom and sister are living in a trailer in Enid, Oklahoma, Billy is serving time in prison because of a little thing known as insider trading. Billy manages to earn his law degree through correspondence courses and becomes the 'prisoners lawyer'. Billy is released early and hired by a fairly demanding law firm. He spends most of his time trying to get a new trial for his friend in prison, whom he believes is innocent, while also trying to clear his dead fathers smeared reputation.<br />While overall a good story, the character of Billy Strobe, to me, was not likeable. His overly ambitious efforts to prove the innocence of his friend in prison cost innocent lives on the outside. This was not worthy of praise. His efforts to clear his fathers name was.<br />This book will be enjoyed by most legal thriller fans.<br /><br />Maybe my mood just wasn't into this kind of story. It's happened before.	2001-10-16
Great fiction	A great political thriller. This novel, in my opinion, puts Vince Flynn in the big leagues with Ludlum and Clancy.<br />CIA director Thomas Stansfield has died. In line to get his job is Dr. Irene Kennedy, who is currently heading the CIA's counter-terrorism unit. There are some powerful people who do not want to see Kennedy become director. In the meantime, Mitch Rapp, a 32-year-old operative, is on a mission to try to find out who tried to have him killed when he was in Germany. This leads him to Italy where he looks up an old girlfriend/assassin. This is where the bodies start piling up. On his return to the USA, he's asked to do a final job. He accepts. Through information from the Mossad, it is learned that Saddam Hussein has three working nuclear weapons. These weapons are hidden under a large hospital in Baghdad. Rapp's job is to destroy or steal these weapons without innocent casualties.<br />With a rather complex plot that creates wars between different politicians, as well as other countries, Vince Flynn has delivered a fantastic story. Everything is covered. From Arab-Israeli relations to the powerful workings of Washington D.C.  From the Mossad to Saddam Hussein and his family. A well rounded, fast-paced, well written novel.<br />Highly recommended	2001-10-16
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />A fairly solid medical thriller from first time novelist V.A. MacAlister.<br />A virulent strain of malaria, a secret serum, and high level coverups, all move this biological thriller at a steady pace. A well researched and timely novel. The characters didn't strike me as likeable. Maybe because, as the reader, I couldn't relate to them. Dry?<br />Inside the covers:<br />Anopheles...She bears no particular malice toward humankind, does not in fact really seek him out. To the Anopheles, a man is as good as a mouse. She is only seeking a blood meal, and that only for the urgency of motherhood. What could be more simple, more pure?<br />Recommended	2001-10-05
4 1/2 stars	This was actually my first experience reading a Lansdale novel. I must say it was well worth it. It had a certain originality I truly enjoyed.<br />Hap Collins and Leonard Pine are two good oleâ boys from East Texas working as security guards at a huge chicken processing plant. Although Leonard is black and gay and Hap is straight and white, they are as close as brothers. When Hap saves the life of the ownerâs daughter, he is given a substantial reward, as well as time off for him and Leonard to go on vacation. They opt for a Caribbean cruise that doesnât bring much relaxation. First theyâre abandoned, and then theyâre mugged. They could have been killed, but an old man and his machete save them. Hap gets involved with the old mans daughter and soon finds that this family is having some major problems.<br />Murders, kidnappings, and a wide assortment of odd characters and situations are played out in a way that gives this work of fiction a fresh originality. As secrets are revealed the body count begins. Hap and Leonard seem to find trouble wherever they go and that keeps the entertainment factor high. Itâs rude and itâs crude and itâs incredibly fun to read. Joe R. Lansdale will be on my must read list.<br />Highly recommended for guys who like a crude and fun ride.	2001-10-01
3 1/2 stars	Karin Slaughterâs debut novel comes with some thrills and quite a bit of emotion.<br />Dr. Sara Linton is a part time coroner and a full time pediatrician for the Heartsdale Childrens Clinic. Jeffrey Tolliver, Heartsdaleâs chief of police, is Saraâs ex-husband and sometime friend. Sara and her sister Tessa are eating lunch at the local diner. When Sara goes into the bathroom she finds Sybil Adams, an acquaintance, mutilated... and bleeding to death. The case hits pretty close to home because the towns only female detective, Lena Adams, is the victims sister.<br />Relationships and a wide range of emotions dominate the story creating a good depth to the characters. Ex-lovers, distraught families, and secret pasts all play a part in a sometime graphically violent and often emotional novel.<br />Recommended	2001-09-28
Dirk is back!	Clive Cussler comes through with yet another fine adventure that provides a great escape.<br />It all starts when Dirk Pitt, working for NUMA in the South Pacific, notices a fire burning on the horizon. It seems a state of the art cruise ship named 'Emerald Dolphin' is experiencing a major fire. The radios, as well as the sprinkler system, has been sabotaged and the lifeboats have been burned. Dirk must now rescue over 2000 people. This amazing rescue, along with 3 or 4 others in the novel, seem to be somewhat miraculous, but they sure are fun to read. As a multi-billionaire attempts to take over the oil business and eventually the government, Dirk has his work cut out for him.<br /> Dirk, and his long time friend Al Giordino, get together once again in this entertaining and fast-paced story. This well rounded and well researched novel includes tales of the old Vikings and Norsemen. Jules Verne also plays a part in this story. Cussler paints a vivid picture of his disasters and the ensuing action. The threat on Manhattan cut especially close to home. A Dirk Pitt novel that ranks among the best.<br />Highly recommended for action and thrills.	2001-09-20
Great!	Ethan Black returns with a great novel that's even better than `Irresistible'. A timely thriller that holds nothing back<br />When Conrad Voort meets up with an old best friend named Meechum Keefe at a tavern in Greenwich Village, he finds that his friend is scared and paranoid. Meechum gives Voort a list of five names and addresses and asks him to find something that ties these names together. The next day Voort finds Meechum is missing, and with the only clue he has to go on, he starts investigating the list. Voort soon finds out that there is very little to tie the people on the list together. The first three on the list seem to have died in separate accidents. The last two are still alive, for now. When Voort tries to locate the last two people, he realizes there lives are in danger. When he locates number four, a beautiful doctor, he falls in love. He soon makes a connection. It seems that terrorism might tie all these people together.<br />Terrorists and secret organizations all play a crucial role in this well crafted and very well written thriller. From the descriptive narrative to the tight dialogue, this story puts you in the center. Very entertaining and very involving. I very much look forward to Ethan Black's future novels.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Inside the covers:<br />A scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim, so he asks a frog to carry him across. The frog says \\"are you crazy? If I put you on my back, you'll sting me and I'll die.\\" The scorpion says, \\"That's stupid. If I do that we both die.\\" So the frog says yes. And when they're in the middle of the river, the scorpion stings him. They're going under. The scorpion says, \\"I can't help it. It's my nature.\\"	2001-09-15
Will the real Robin Cook return?	After numerous delays, I'm glad that Robin Cook's latest finally made it to the bookshelves. It wasn't quite worth the wait.<br />When Deborah Cochrane and Joanna Meissner, two college grad students, decide to sell their eggs, it seemed like a good idea, after all it paid 45,000 dollars per person. This money would be enough for them to get a condo, and travel to Venice for a year to work on their theses. The Wingate Clinic, which offered the money, performed this procedure in an afternoon, with apparently no problems.<br />A year down the road when they return from Venice, Joanna becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her eggs, even though this went against the agreement with the clinic. Well of course Deborah had to help her obsessed friend find out. Big mistake. One of many to come.<br />Cook's latest medical thriller is not quite up to par, and not what I would expect from him. In the medical thriller genre, there are quite a few authors that can provide a better book than this (Palmer, Gerritsen). I had no compassion at all for the protagonist's of this story. Deborah and Joanna's ideas for breaking into the clinics computers or disguising themselves for employment made it hard to believe they were college graduate students. When committing felonies, one does not leave so much evidence as they did. Two clueless characters. This timely and controversial subject could have been written with much more depth and adventure. I wonder if this was actually written by Cook, and why is there a ten-year-old picture on the jacket and not a newer one?<br />Lightly recommended for the die hard Cook fan.	2001-09-12
Good thriller	Tess Gerritsens latest is a pleaser.<br />2 years ago, while living in Savannah, Dr. Catherine Cordell barely survived a brutal rape. The serial rapist/murderer known as Andrew Capra, aka The Surgeon, had previously raped and killed three other women. His last victim, Dr. Cordell, fought back and killed him.<br />Now living in Boston and working as a trauma center doctor, Catherine Cordell soon finds out about some recent rapes and murders happening in the Boston area that are very similar to the ones committed by Andrew Capra, the man she killed 2 years ago. This killer starts sending her clues, which causes her to recapture all those hideous moments of the past. She soon finds out that she may be the final target.<br />Detective Thomas Moore is a rather easygoing guy (with a growing attachment to Cordell) assigned to these recent killings, along with lead detective Rizzoli, who happens to be a women struggling to prove herself to a mostly male police force.<br />Filled with well-choreographed emergency room action and engrossing scenes of life and death, this novel does not disappoint. It seemed very emotional and personal due to the often-brought up issue of rape. A well-rounded medical thriller.<br />Where we go depends on what we know, and what we know depends on where we go<br />Recommended	2001-09-09
Hardcase	Though Dan Simmons's previous novel `Darwin's Blade' was better, I feel his foray into this mystery/thriller genre was well worth it.<br />Joe Kurtz is an ex private investigator doing time for a homicide. He has survived over 11 years in Attica with a 10,000-dollar bounty on his head, which was offered by the Mosque brothers when he killed one of their own. After his release he decides to offer his services to the local mafia don, Byron Farino. It seems Farino's accountant has gone missing. When Farino decides to hire Kurtz, that's when the fireworks start. The 10,000-dollar bounty offered to kill Kurtz is still payable on the outside; so on top of looking for the missing accountant, Kurtz is dodging bullets from an assortment of bad guy's. Everyone from the drug lords, to the Alabama Beagle Boys, seem to be after a piece of the Kurtz pie.<br />A fast-paced and oft times violent novel. The character of Joe Kurtz seemed to lack depth. The story itself must have lacked a little depth because it read like a sequel. I liked the varied characters and the quick and snappy dialogue. No wasted speech here.<br />Overall an easy to enjoy, quick read, delivered by an author that's done better work.<br />Recommended.	2001-09-07
4 1/2 star	Gregg Andrew Hurwitz's second novel comes of with a bang.<br />The year is 2007. There is a huge hole in the ozone layer on the South American coast in the area of the Galapagos Islands. Because of this depletion the local governments have had to put up electronic billboards advising you of your \\"minutes to burn\\". In March of 2002, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake, dubbed the `Initial Event', struck the region.<br />Dr. Rex Williams is the ecotectonist assigned to place 6 Gps units on a small island in the Galapagos called Sangre de Dios to study seismic events. Also along with Williams is a differing group of Navy Seals--one ex-Navy--assigned to protect him. When a genetically mutated creature is discovered on the island, all hell soon breaks loose.<br />Hurwitz has written an in-depth and highly researched scientific thriller that reminds me more of `Predator' than anything else. The characters were described with a depth that made you feel you were there. Hurwitz also gives you a good idea of how fragile the ecology of these island are and how simple new species are introduced. I loved the science and I loved the action. Only rarely predictable. The Darwin virus described, with its massive range of DNA seems quite implausible. But is it truly?<br />Highly Recommended.	2001-09-05
On acid it might seem real	This is Ross Lamanna's first novel. He also wrote `Rush Hour' with Jackie Chan. This novel reads a lot like an action movie including the super hero and the evil villains.<br />Batu Khan, self-named after the grandson of Genghis Khan, has created an empire from some of the old countries of the Soviet Union. Khan's empire, known as the TAA (Trans-Altaic Alliance), which has an army of 1.5 million, looks to rule the world one day. With top-secret technology and an army of super soldiers-thanks to drugs-Khans' threat is real.<br />Matt Wilder, an agent for the OSI, is investigating a series of murders committed by normally sane and passive people that seem to lose control and go haywire. Wilder soon finds a connection between these gruesome murders and Khan's plot for world domination.<br />There is no doubt this is an action packed, wham-bam read. I would call it a comic book novel. With the futuristic weaponry (microwave guns) and the inhuman feats (jumping from rocket ship to rocket ship at 150,000 feet with a tear in the spacesuit) to the action (incursion tubes used to carry six horsemen on their steeds then parachuted out of a big airplane). Oh, and Wilder is also blind in one eye. He certainly can perform some amazing feats without depth perception.<br />A fun book to read, though at times laughable.<br />Recommended for younger readers.	2001-08-31

4 1/2 stars	America, Europe and Russia have so far spent 50 billion dollars on SuperAegis, a satellite that's main objective is anti-missile defense. When the launch is attempted, disaster strikes and the satellite is lost at sea and nobody seems to be able to find it. USS America is Americas newest nuclear powered submarine armed with tomahawk missiles. The 2 billion dollar sub, which is carrying 134 men, is hijacked on its maiden voyage and soon disappears into the Atlantic Ocean. The terrorist who has taken the USS America, starts firing missiles at Washington D.C. and New York City in separate attacks. These specific tomahawks are called Flashlight missiles or E-missiles. When detonated over a city it releases a strong electromagnetic pulse and makes everything running on electricity virtually useless making the city shutdown. When this happens, political, psychological, and financial upheaval occurs. Rear Admiral Jake Grafton soon learns there is a connection between the lost satellite and the stolen submarine. Grafton, along with his aide Toad Tarkington, have there work cut out for them in this well rounded thriller that gives you a lot of detail with a lot of action. What you have here is a story of superpower politics, cutting edge technology, and greed (as quoted by Grafton). Throw in some Russian and European spies with a few computer hackers and you have yourself a heck of a story. I liked Coonts' previous novel `Hong Kong' a little better than this one. Highly recommended.	2001-08-26
5 star comedy	Outstanding! Tim Dorsey I salute you. Your talent at writing comedy is tops.<br />The race for the Florida Governorship is the central theme in this laugh out loud mixed bag of nuts. Marlon Conrad is the protagonist. As the current governor, Conrad is running against house speaker Gomer Tatum, a Democrat who doesn't seem to have much of a chance at winning. When Conrad is called to duty and sent to the Balkans on a peacekeeping mission, what he witnesses changes his life. On his return he surprises many of his colleagues by renting a Winnebago-The Orange Crush-and starts touring the state of Florida by visiting the families of his slain friends which he served with in the Balkans. During his tour his polls are climbing and falling, back and forth. You never know what he's going to do next. With him on this tour is Gottfried Escrow, who is his chief of staff and would do anything to discredit Gomer. Pimento is also along for the ride as Conrad's press secretary. Pimento has amnesia and he's not sure who he is. This story is filled with many unique characters.  Bab's, fianc&eacute; to Marlon, has a neat little trick she likes to use when making love; I'll just say it has to do with ventriloquism and Howdy Doody. Helmut Von Zeppelin's experience with his football team was quite hilarious also.<br /> From serial killers to tennis stars, this book is an all around fun time to read. I haven't laughed so many times at one book for a long time. Great, great fun.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-23
Good sequel	Maggie O'Dell has been reassigned to a training position, for her own protection, since the escape of Albert Stucky 5 months ago. From being the FBI's top profiler, being demoted temporarily to a training specialist isn't something Maggie is happy with. Emotionally, Maggie seems to be a loose cannon since the escape of Stucky, drawing her weapon every time the doorbell rings or someone knocks. Maggie has just bought a 2 story Tudor and has not yet unpacked when neighbors start disappearing.  Assistant director of the ISU at Quantico, Kyle Cunningham, assigns R.J. Tully to head the case after it's discovered that Stucky is at it again. After 2 years of chasing Stucky, Maggie wasn't about to bow out gracefully, and soon gets to aid Tully in the investigation. Stucky seems to be targeting any female that Maggie is mutually acquainted with.<br />An emotional roller coaster ensues for Maggie as she tries to keep her head on straight and try to out think Stucky.<br />Though not as violent as the first Kava novel this book describes some gruesome happenings. Some interesting characters and a couple twists with just enough suspense made this a good read.<br />Inside the covers:<br />\\"The decisions we make in a split second will always reveal our true nature, our true self. Whether we like it or not. When that split second comes, don't think, don't analyze, don't feel and never second-guess-just react. Trust. Trust in yourself. You do that-just that-and I'm willing to bet you end up with nothing more than a little mud on your shoes.\\"	2001-08-22
4 1/2 star thriller	Freedman's latest is a good edge of your seat thriller<br />When Fritz Tullis is fired from the University of Texas for having an affair with the wife of a prestigious donor, (It seems that every woman he meets, falls in love with him. Hmmmm.) he has nowhere to go but back to the estate of his family in southern Maryland. While living in a shack that's located on the estate, he partakes in his hobbies of drinking, smoking grass and photographing. While out in the swamp photographing his favorite secret pet-Ollie the whooping crane-he notices his neighbor's plane landing in a private airfield. Much to his surprise, he witnesses and photographs a cold-blooded murder. The victim turns out to be a Russian Senior Counselor. The property belongs to James Roach, an assistant Secretary of State. Eventually Fritz decides he should do something about this murder, or at least find out who's responsible. As Fritz soon learns, he's in way to deep.<br />  One would think that Fritz is smart, but being a professor of history does not make him a good detective. He seems to lack the ability to read people well. His way with the ladies seems a little too lucky. Fritz also seems to carry a lot of emotion around with him. One wonders why.<br />The story moves at a brisk pace. With a couple of surprises and yet some predictable plotting, this was still a very good book. I look forward to your next one Mr. Freedman. Oh, by the way, a King Air is not a jet.<br />Highly recommended	2001-08-20
4 1/2 stars	Ex LAPD SWAT negotiator Jeff Talley is now chief of police of a small town in the `burbs. The reason he's an `ex' negotiator is because he failed to save a young hostage in LA that died while he was watching and the guilt drove him out. Meanwhile, three rather non-intelligent criminals decide to rob a store. Everything goes haywire.  The storeowner gets shot, and as they escape, their car breaks down. The closest escape is a house by the road. A father and his two children are held hostage. As it turns out, they couldn't have picked a worse family to hold hostage. In steps Talley as the man in charge of the scene, hoping to pass that on to the county sheriff's department as soon as he can. A homicidal killer and the mob all play a key roll in this top-notch thriller.<br />Robert Crais' latest novel flows with suspense from beginning to end. During the last third of the story you'll be looking for your seat belt. Even though it had some stupid criminals and a not so smart local mobster (his plan to get the disc's seemed ludicrous), the story pulled you in and kept you reading. I think this book is on par with his last. Keep up the good work Robert.<br />Highly Recommended	2001-08-18
Good mystery	Martin Collins, a retired Air Force investigator who is currently the police chief of Warrentown, a small town in Virginia, is on occasion called upon by the military to help in criminal investigations. This time around they would like his help in solving a multiple murder. An Air Force Colonel and her 2 children have been slaughtered. Lieutenent Simon Santos, chief homicide investigator of the Arlington County PD, who requested Collins, is working it from the civilian side. As Collins and Simon work together, they find that the government and the military seem to be covering up a defect in a popular aircraft.<br />Character development and a steady pace with many twists and turns makes this a good read. Secret files, misleading clues and many suspicious characters, will keep you guessing. Beware the power of bureaucracy.<br />Recommended.	2001-08-16
Good first novel	As a first novel from Brian Haig, I must say I was fairly impressed.<br />A group of 35 Serbian soldiers is massacred; some with close in headshots. A group from the Special Forces A-Team is arrested for this atrocity. Sean Drummond, a JAG lawyer, is put in charge of the investigation, to find out whether it was self-defense or outright murder. With his witty and smart-alecky way, Drummond weaves from cover-up to cover-up in what seems an endless pursuit of justice.<br />I felt really comfortable reading this book. The writing style was fluid. There was not as much suspense as other military thrillers but the manner in which Drummond investigated and interviewed potential suspects kept me on edge. I got a pretty clear picture on the Serbian/Albanian relations and some of the politics involved with NATO operations. Military operations with the KLA brought some insight also.<br />Overall a satisfying read, especially for military buffs.<br />Inside the covers:<br />He said, “Sometimes those principles they teach at West Point about duty and honor and country, sometimes they clash against one another. The world’s not as pristine as West Point makes it out to be. Sometimes you have to decide which of those three is most important. You have to decide which principle you need to sacrifice.”<br />I said, “I didn’t go to west point, so I don’t know about all that. I tell you what I do know. I know what makes us different from the Serbs. We don’t coddle our murderers. We don’t lie to the world when our troops commit a massacre. We wash our laundry in the open. That’s duty and honor and country, all in one.” At least that’s what I thought.	2001-08-13
MHC  No Vacancy	Jeff Converse was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Falsely accused of rape and attempted murder, Converse is arrested and sentenced to serve just 1 year at  Rikers. While enroute to Rikers a fatal accident occurs and Converse is one of three people killed. Almost everyone accepts his death, except his father. The fact is that Jeff Converse has been dragged into the tunnels of Manhattan to become part of a big secret game. The MHC puts on this game.<br />John Saul has chosen to write a thriller this time around, as opposed to the horror novel. Good choice John. I'll say one thing about this story; I'll never look at subways the same way again. This has been a suspenseful foray into the depths of Manhattan that kept my interest to the end. Though at times predictable I think John Saul is still at the top of his game.<br />Inside the covers:<br />to allow for society's elite to do what was necessary in private, without the necessity of convincing a seemingly uneducable public to find the spine to do the right thing. The 100 Club.<br />Highly Recommended	2001-08-11
A fun ride	Covert-one operative Jon Smith is sent to Venice to help bring out Yuri Danko, who has sent a desperate message for help. Tragedy strikes. Yuri is killed and Smith barely escapes (thanks to a piano). Thus begins Jon Smiths desperate attempt to find out what Yuri knew that cost him his life.<br />This is what I consider good escapist fiction. International locales with some space shuttle action thrown in, drives this somewhat complex thriller. The idea behind this biological thriller, is using an altered smallpox virus with no possible vaccine, in warfare. Sure it stretches reality but that's what escapist fiction is all about. The motivation behind some of the powerful figures in this plan are??? I'm not sure.<br />Non-stop action and suspense.<br />Recommended for thriller fans who want to escape.	2001-08-01
average thriller	Peter Tyler, an ex-homicide detective thats about to lose his house, get's a temporary assignment with the National Transportation Safety Board to find out what is causing a series of train derailments. Almost 2 years ago Umberto Alvarez lost his wife and twins in a collision with a train, where the blame was ultimately put on his wife. Alvarez thinks differently and believes that Northern Union Railroad is at fault and is covering up some major problems. He want's to get even. Peter Tylers pursuit of this so called terrorist drives this story and brings it to it's exciting conclusion.<br />The action and romance move this story at a somewhat average pace. For some reason this latest Pearson novel just doesn't have the oomph I'm used to. More idle time than suspense could be a factor or the simple fact that some of the characters had little depth.<br />Recommend...Library first	2001-07-30
High on forensics	Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist, is summoned to the scene of an accident. An Air TransSouth flight has crashed in the mountains of North Carolina killing all eighty-eight people on board. Near the accident scene Tempe finds a foot with no other body parts around it. It turns out this foot does not belong to anybody on the plane. From who’s body does this foot originate? Why are people trying to stop her investigation?<br />As Kathy Reichs takes you on this highly detailed investigative ride, you’ll learn much about forensics and science on the way. I like that. To be both entertained and educated. I did learn just a little more than I needed to about VFA’s (volatile fatty acids), but it was fun anyway. Overall this was a good medical and forensics procedural with a lot of neat information.<br />A word of advice:  If you get a death threat, it’s best not to go running at night, even if you do have a dog.<br />Inside the covers:<br />Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an  Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.	2001-07-24
3 1/2 stars	This time around Paul Madriani and Harry Hinds are defending Dr. David Crone, a research scientist accused of murdering a young African-American colleague named Kalista Jordan. The evidence points strongly at Dr. Crone. Was it racial? Did it have to do with the highly secretive genetic research Dr. Crone was working on? Or was it a combination of both; Racial genetics?<br /> Madriani and Hinds do what they can in this rather lackluster effort by Steve Martini. A fairly slow-paced, very average legal novel like this is not what I expected from Martini. This was a dry Martini. It also seems to me that the title was chosen before the book was written. The Jury???<br />A good story thatâs just not up to Martini specâs<br />Inside the covers:<br />â~A scientist goes where science takes himâ<br />Recommendation: The Library	2001-07-22
Fair summer read	See storyline above.<br />I thought this was kind of a fun book to read. The character of Patrick Wallington as a woman loving reporter, though not highly likable, did grow on you. At times laugh out loud funny.At times not totally sensible. The story line did have a uniqueness only John Irving could bring to paper. I did enjoy the first half of the novel more, simply because there was more going on. Wallington's trip to japan--for the 'Future of Women' conference--was hilarious, as were some of his other rendezvous'. The subplot involving Dr. Zajac and his problems drew me in too. The character of Doris Clausen seemed rather shallow and I found it hard to believe that Wallington could even fall in love with this lady. The book did lack emotion and depth with some of the characters, but the plot and comical farce made up for some of that. An overall fun and quick read for the summer.<br />Recommended.	2001-07-18
4 1/2 stars	This was my first Buffa novel and I absolutely loved it! The brilliant but also very much hated Judge Calvin Jeffries is found murdered in a courthouse parking lot. A couple months later another prominent judge is found murdered in the same location and in the same manner. A different homeless man is arrested for each murder in what seems to be open and shut cases. Attorney Joseph Antonelli decides to defend the accused in the murder of the last judge and soon discovers nothing is as it seems.<br />This was a very engrossing read for me. I also feel that this is one of the top ten in this genre, as opined by a previous reviewer. The writing style drew me in as much as the story. Smooth and captivating dialogue really kept me reading all night. A finely written legal/mystery thriller with plenty of emotion and mystery that will make you want to bring the book with you wherever you go till you finish. It’s that good.<br />Inside the covers:<br /> Oh where is the noble fear of modesty, or the strength of virtue, now that blasphemy is in power and men have put justice behind them, and there is no law but lawlessness and none join in fear of the Gods.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-14
4 1/2 stars	It all starts when Jack Reacher is picked up, while hitchhiking, by a seemingly beautiful woman. This woman, Carmen Greer, seems to have quite a story to tell and wants Reacher help. It seems her husband is being released from prison for a stretch he did on tax evasion, and if her story is to be believed, he’s a very abusive husband and she needs help desperately. After a few tricks by Reacher to find out if Carmen is telling the truth, he agrees to help. So what’s next? Twists and turns with some great action and a very intelligent killing crew.<br />Lee Child has written another fine Reacher Novel. It was fast-paced and filled with some neat twists. Reacher’s almost supernatural ability of knowing how people think give this story the edge it needs.<br />Inside the covers:<br />“Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead”  Ben Franklin<br />Highly recommended	2001-07-04
4 1/2 stars	When Max Shapiro finds out he’s dying of cancer, he decides to quit his job as a money launderer for the mob and to spend his last few weeks spending some of his hard earned money. Well you don’t just quit the mob. While living in Aspen, he finds out he’s been misdiagnosed and actually has no cancer at all. He turns to Cole Springer, an ex-secret service agent, for protection. Unfortunately, Springer desperately needs the money to avoid the bank repossessing his tavern, and takes the job.  The action begins.<br />This novel was great fun to read. A sort of Elmore Leonard/Bill Fitzhugh mix, that’s filled with unique characters. Ray Dean and Auteen, two mismatched thugs, were a riot to listen too. Max Shapiro had the Joe Pesci type personality from Lethal Weapon, which was hilarious. Then of course there is Cole Springer, a hero who’s hard not to like.<br />Great dialogue and nonstop entertainment filled with just the right amount of humor, makes this crime drama fun to read. W.L. Ripley will go on my must read list.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-28
A good mystery	Joe Bailey is a police detective in Atlanta who specializes in debunking psychics. Dr. Robert Nelson, a professor at the local university, whose specialty is parapsychology, is found impaled on a wall by a sculpture that no man alone could have lifted. The number one suspect is an eight-year-old boy. In steps Joe Bailey.<br />Roy Johansen has written a good mystery, and in creating a skeptical and rational character, as portrayed by Bailey, a refreshing one at that. Johansen shows how easily charlatans and psychics fool people.<br />A solidly written mystery, which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br />  Inside the covers:<br />“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof”	2001-06-28
Good summer read	Dr. Laura Donaldson is a cancer researcher looking for the elusive cure for cancer, when she happens upon information and evidence of a death row inmate who seems to have an immune system that just eats up cancer cells. David Haines is the death row inmate with the super immune system along with a fanatical religious belief that will not allow him to give his blood. He's on death row for killing numerous doctors. Dr. Laura Donaldson's attempts to acquire a sample of his blood through legal means backfires when Haines makes a somewhat predictable escape from prison. Kevin Sheldrake, the FBI agent who captured Haines the first time, is on the case again. Can they capture him alive?<br />With a gritty edge of suspense and a little background on cancer and cults, this makes for some entertaining summer reading. You'll see the depths reached by religious fanaticism and the fervor of a scientist with a goal. The ending was left open for a sequel and, to me, a little disappointing.<br />Recommended.	2001-06-21
It kept me mesmerized	When attorney Beth Convey collapsed during a trial, she didn't realize that she was going to wake up with someone elses heart. During the healing process she notices certain things seem to be happening with her, such as nightmares, new food tastes, Russian poetry popping into her head, a hotter temper, a new ability to drive well at high speeds and a certain phone number that keeps coming into her mind.<br />On the other side of town is Jeff Hammond, a disgraced former FBI agent, now a Washington Post reporter. Jeff is on the trail of a former KGB agent.<br />What ties these two protagonists together is what brings this story its unique plot. Cellular Memory, a supposed closer link between the brain and the heart involving neurotransmitters. This premise itself could make for an exciting story, but when you throw in everything from assasination attempts to Russian history, brainwashed fanatics to double agents, you end up with a well researched novel riddled with intrigue. I thinks it's quite comparable to Ludlum.<br />Highly Recommended.<br />Inside the Covers:<br />The secret of human life, the universal secret, the root secret from which all other secrets spring, is the longing for more life. The furious and insatiable desire to be everything else without ever ceasing to be ourselves.<br />Miguel de Unamuno	2001-06-16
3 1/2 stars	Jessica Riley is a psychiatrist treating the presidents daughter, Cassie Andreas, for post-traumatic stress syndrome. This subsequent to her witnessing a brutal murder. When Melissa Riley comes to visit her sister Jessica, some weird connections occur between her and Cassie. Is it Melissa's past treatment for the same ailment that brings her to Cassie's side? Then enters Michael Travis, international bad guy. Whats his connection? This somewhat romantic thriller moves at a fair pace overall with a sometime slow moving plot. Higher in emotion than action, creating a better depth to the characters, this was a fast read with some good subplots.<br />A lite recommendation.	2001-06-12
4 1/2 stars	Former National Security agent Bill Lane returns in this fast-paced international thriller, to battle a former East German Stasi officer, Helmut Speyer. It seems there is a secret buried in an old german bunker under hundred's of feet of water. A secret not even the present day Germans want made public. With the help of his wife, Frances Shipley, he infiltrates Speyer's operation, and in doing so, helps recover this secret. The action is non-stop, taking you from the mountains of Montana to the countryside of eastern Germany. From the high seas of the Atlantic to the D.C. area. Ambushes, sinking ships, narrow escapes(quite a well dressed hero we have here)along with some underwater action, all bring this hard to put down novel a high edge of excitement.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-08
4 1/2 stars	Miami attorney Nick Rey seems to be on the fast track as far as his career is concerned, when he finds out his father has been kidnapped in South America. Here starts a chain of events that leads Nick on an adventure not soon forgotten. From the jungles of Columbia to the streets of Miami, Mr. Grippando has written another gripping adventure that dares you to finish reading in one sitting. At times emotional and at times humorous, yet always gripping, the author has written a solid story that entertains all the way through. A timely thriller including some ransom for hostage problems in S.A. You'll feel the sweat and chills as you read.<br />Highly recommended for all thriller readers.	2001-06-03
A keeper	Once again some top of the line entertainment from Jon Land. Palestinian American detective Ben Kamal and Israeli detective Danielle Barnea meet up again in this outstanding adventure. Holocaust survivors are being murdered. A labor camp escapee and New York billionaire loses a son to an assassin. High school students start mysteriously dying. This novel covers a lot of territory as most of it begins in the Middle East slowly spreading to Europe and ending in New York. Biological research as well as secrets of the holocaust are just a couple of the things involved in this top of the line adventure. Jon Land has created a vivid novel with colorful characters and locales, with surprises in store at every turn. Keep it up Jon, you're on my 'A' list.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-26
4 1/2 Stars	After Adrienne Cope's sister commits suicide, her mission is to find out why. She confronts the psychiatrist that treated her, a Dr. Jeff Duran, and places all the blame on him. When she does some investigating of her own she finds out Dr. Duran is not who he says he is and could actually be a victim himself. Things soon start spinning out of control as the bloodshed begins and  secrets become revealed. Because memory is not all it's cracked up to be.<br />A thoroughly exciting story with a harrowing premise. Great locales and great writing do make for a great read. I do feel that the ending came rather abruptly with not quite enough closure.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-25
A good Deaver novel	Wyatt Gillette is a hacker serving a year in prison when he's released temporarily by the California state police to help find a murderous hacker known as 'Phate'. The setting of course is in Silicon Valley. This is a highly suspenseful novel filled with some interesting twists. There are a lot of computer and hacking themes throughout the whole book but it's made easy to follow and understand by the author-even for the computer illiterate. A good suspenseful read.<br />Recommended.	2001-05-14
Typical Carlin	Sure there is some rehashed stuff in this book. Some things do bare repeating. As a George Carlin fan I found it quite satisfying and enjoyable to read. In fact I saw his act in January at Vegas and it was great. There are plenty of gems in this book along with some classic one liners. A treat for the George Carlin fan.<br />Recommended.	2001-05-08
4 1/2 stars	See story summary above.<br />R.J. Pineiro comes through again with another hi-tech thriller. The action blends smoothly with the techno-babble in this outstanding adventure featuring the IRS and FBI along with some other very powerful characters. You find yourself cheering on the underdogs with vehemence rarely felt in a novel. There were a few flaws in the editing, but overall I felt it was a well rounded story with a high entertainment value. Keep it up RJ.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-02
Some country thrills	Billy Tree is ex-Secret Service agent who returns to his small home town in Nebraska after experiencing a rather tragic event that took the life of his partner, causing him to resign. Old friends and bullys, cornfields and silos, along with murder and gossip are just some of the things that will be facing Billy  Tree when he returns. This average thriller has an edge all its own. Though the story moved at a steady pace and kept you supplied with a good dose of suspense, I felt that except for the protagonist, the characters seemed shallow and lacked depth. It would have been nice to know a little more about some of the characters.<br />Recommended...Lightly	2001-04-30
Good, but not his best	Once again Tulsa attorney Ben Kincaid's talents are required, when a young female stripper hires him to defend her against murder charges. It seems that a police officer has been brutally murdered and chained to a fountain in downtown Tulsa and all evidence leads to this rather petite stripper named Keri Dalcanton. Though William Bernhardt takes you on a twisty turny ride in this newest novel, it just doesn't match up to his previous work. The courtroom scenes are as good as ever. One reviewer also mentioned that this effort seemed amateurish. What I felt was amateurish was Ben Kincaid's character. Falling in love with a client? Not even questioning the clients brother? Not the Ben Kincaid from old, is it?<br />Recommended	2001-04-23
4 1/2 star thriller	Quinn Barry, a young computer programmer for the FBI, is testing a new program and stumbles upon a mysterious string of DNA that seems to connect some brutal murders. It seems that these murders were not meant to be found out about. This is where the thrills begin. Unusual Accidents, horrific murders, a madman that makes Hannibal seem like a misdemeanor offender, all come together in a great thriller that will keep you up all night experiencing an emotional thrill ride. This is a fantastic effort by Kyle Mills that will put him in my top ten authors list (fiction).<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-20
High flying action	A top international lawyer is hired by the Peruvian president to arrest the former president-for tortures committed in Peru-when the plane arrives in Athens. The captain of the European carrier that is carrying the ex-president has different ideas and will do what ever is possible to keep this from happening. While flying all over Europe to evade this legitimate warrant for arrest, the reader is treated to some suspenseful reading and some interesting cat and mouse ploys. This is a fast paced action thriller with some political overtones. Most of the action and descriptions seem to come from a knowledgeable pilot/author, but I truly must question one glaring error I noticed in the book that a pilot would never make. Squawk 266.....9? A nine? In a squawk? Not likely Mr. Nance.<br />Overall great entertainment.	2001-04-18
Enjoyable	See story summary above.<br />I enjoyed this mystery thriller. The locations in Alaska and the flashbacks to NYC all helped to bring a little more substance to this story. The characters did come of as a little shallow in my opinion. I also think a little more history could have been wrapped in the story. As with any fiction novel, I rarely read the whole jacket summary, for it gives away far to much information and leaves few surprises. I get the protagonists name and read the first couple sentences and that's usually all.<br />Recommended.	2001-04-11
Not quite a classic	See storyline summary above.<br />When I started reading this novel I thought I was in for a treat. It started out with all the classic Stephen King elements. As I progressed with the novel I began to change my mind. For one thing I think it was to long. Normally, as with classic King, the longer the better, but this story seemed to drag a bit at times. At times it also becomese a little confusing as to the perspective of the narrative. Such as when, where and who this perspective is coming from. An enjoyable novel overall for the true Stephen King fan and it's better than a couple of his previous novels, but it just isn't comparable to 'The Stand' or 'It'.<br />Recommended for Stephen King fans.	2001-04-04
Average for Patterson	See story summary above.<br />I did enjoy reading this latest from James Patterson. Only because it was a fairly quick read. At times emotional and at times suspenseful. It also introduced to us, what will be, a new group of crime fighting protagonists-The Womans Murder Club. I had a little trouble swallowing the idea of Mr. Patterson writing in the first person narrative of a woman. That just doesn't strike me as credible. A good read overall with the typical plot twists of a good mystery.<br />Recommended.	2001-03-25
The Program	See story summary above.<br />What started with a promising beginning as a nail biter, sort of waned as I progresssed into the story. During most of the novel, I feel the story line dragged quite a bit. There was a couple of suspenseful parts, mostly at the end and a little at the beginning. I did have a certain liking of the character by the name of Carl Luppo, who struck me as a sort of Joe Pesci type gangster with a sense of humor. An overall enjoyable read but not necessarily one that's hard to put down.	2001-03-22
Environmental Indy Jones	See summary above.<br />An overall enjoyable read. Fast and furiously paced with a touch of some unbelievable action. Reminded me of an environmental Indiana Jones novel. I could have rated this a 5 star if only it was written in a more character believable way. I loved the settings in the novel and the information it put forward. From biological hazards to potential water wars. From secret cities in Russia to biological dangers in the Middle East. You'll also learn a bit about Turkey and its surrounding neighbors. A thrilling ride. I look forward to the next book in the hopes that it gets polished up a bit more.<br />Recommended for the adventure reader.	2001-03-17
4 1/2 stars	A very well written thriller in the tradition of 'Silence of the lambs'. I truly enjoyed this novel because it kept me on the edge. Yes, it's graphic. Yes, it's violent. You also become well acquainted with the characters, thus making it emotionally charging. Jonathan Nasaw's evil protaganist, who is diagnosed with DID, drove the story to new heights with his unique set of personalities. A very scary and engrosssing read. As good as Thomas Harris and his Hannibal series.<br />Highly recommended	2001-03-11
Good book for teens	See story summary above.<br />An action packed thrill ride through the jungles. A good story for the comic books. I say this because, as implied elsewhere, it's all so implausible and unbelievable. This title will most be appreciated by young readers. Maybe grades 8-12. But be advised, there is plenty of violence and death.<br />Recommended for younger readers with a taste for adventure.	2001-03-06
GRRRRREEAAT	See story summary above.<br />A rare 5 star.<br />OUTSTANDING! Wow, what a ride. I must say that this is one of the most entertaining and engrossing books I've read. As mentioned elsewhere, the research put into this novel exceeds expectations. Not only will you be educated about history, but you'll get a good idea about what's behind some of the mystery concerning the pyramids and other structures. Ancient cultures are brought to light in an adventerous fashion. The book combines many genres. From 'Indiana Jones' to 'Men In Black'. From '2001' to 'Independence Day'. It leaves nothing out. One of the best adventure novels written in years. Keep it up Steve Alten, because your on my 'must read' list now.<br />Highly recommended for all.	2001-03-02
Nothing but action	See story summary above.<br />No doubt an action packed story that'll take you from spots in England to spots in the Mideast. Pure action all the way. If that's all your looking for, look no further. As far as details and dialogue are concerned, there is very little to sink your teeth into, which is typical for a Higgins novel. Though short and to the point, I do enjoy his books. I would match super hero Sean Dillon against any fictitious villian. Good escapist fiction and quick reading make this book enjoyable.<br />Recommended.	2001-02-25
4 1/4 stars	See story summary above.<br />I thought this was a very enjoyable medical thriller. It reads similar to a Robin Cook novel. The backbone of the novel is about herbal supplements. Good or Bad? You decide. Though an average medical thriller, it will educate you at the same time it entertains you. Both emotional and suspenseful, it will definitely keep you intrigued.<br />Recommended for the lover of medical thrillers.	2001-02-23
The Hunted	See story summary above.<br />I have to agree that this is definitely a page turner. The cat and mouse thrills are here, as is the suspense. When I started reading the book I was thinking of comparing it to Baldacci. The further I got into it the more I decided I was wrong. Though the action is exciting, it's a little far fetched. Some of the scenes actually made me stop reading and say to myself, &quot;Yea, right&quot;. The entertainment value is there if you can swallow some of the action scenes. I think with each novel, Alan Jacobson's writing improves.<br />Recommended.	2001-02-20
4 1/2 stars	See story summary above.<br />This was my first experience with a Dennis Lehane novel. A story of how the past can influence the future. I thought it was very good. A psychological thriller with great depth to the characters. Written in such a manner that you can actually feel how most of the characters feel. At times deeply emotional and compassionate, at other times, suspenseful and thrilling. As the editor says, 'It's not just a whodunit, it's a why they 'dunit'. After reading this novel, I intend on putting Mr. Lehane on my reading list.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-02-18
Mildly adventerous	See story summary above.<br />Dean Ing's latest offering doesn't seem quite up to his usual thrills. Though it moves at a steady pace and has a gripping storyline, it just somehow lacks the suspense that I expect from him. The storyline does include a timely subject, objects known as UAV's-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The timely subject and the steady pace of the novel still made for a good quick read.<br />Recommended.	2001-02-14
3 1/2 stars	See story summary above.<br />This, in my opinion, was a very average mystery. I've read one previous Connelly novel and thought the same of it. I guess if I would have read all his previous novels with both Bosch and McCaleb, my opinion would be different, but just by itself, it's average. It was interesting learning about the actual painter by the name of Heironymus Bosch-who's theme has a major role in this novel-and his rather gruesome paintings. The book did have a steady pace with a better than average ending that I enjoyed.<br />Recommended for mystery/procedural buffs.	2001-02-12
4 1/2 stars	See story summary above.<br />I also thought this was an exceptional story that took me right into the fray of the abortion issue. The characters all had their own personal feelings and their own agendas in regards to this issue. It's interesting to see just how this one issue can raise ones emotions to the point of excess. Mr. Patterson has written an engaging novel that involves some touchy subjects. With arguments presented on both sides, he has done an outstanding job. Protect and Defend is a good book with some strong characters.  I recommend this book to readers who like to get the insight on how Washington DC works and to readers who like a good argument.<br />Recommended	2001-02-09
4 1/2 stars	See story summary above.<br />I must admit that this is Stephen Frey's best novel so far. I know it sounds cliched, but it really grabbed me from the start and wouldn't let go. This book is definitely best read in one to three sittings because it is a little complex sometimes. As far as entertainment and pure escapist fiction goes, this was a great read. Power and Money make this suspenseful novel tick. Keep up the good work Mr. Frey.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-02-06
Thrilling	See story summary above.<br />An engaging mystery thriller set in the panhandle of Florida and parts of Alabama. The story moves at a good pace and provides plenty of thrills and some graphic violence. The lead character, Tom McInnes, seems to smart off quite a bit when he's surrounded by the enemy, which seems somewhat stupid, but other than that he's quite likable. An overall smoothly written novel laced with humor and bodies. I'm looking forward to the follow up to this novel, which is obviously to be expected, because of the unexpected....<br />Recommended for thrills and mystery.	2001-02-04
I was hooked	See story summary above.<br />I was hooked from page one! This book has everything I like.  Suspense, thrills, international locales, and most of all a writing style that fits the story. Story includes old nazis mixed in with international business, psychics, and small town life in the florida swamps. Unusual characters and unique settings set this thrller apart from most others. One Problem though....The art and design of the cover was terrible. It made it look like a dime store mystery, when it was anything but. I truly am looking forward to Singerman's next novel.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-25
Heck of a story	See storyline above.<br />Lochte and Darden have written a fast-paced, very readable,  action mystery. I didn't get a chance to read the first Nikki Hill novel 'The Trials of Nikki Hill',so the character of Nikki seemed a little shallow. Overall though, the book reads well by itself. The story moves at a steady pace until the action packed finale, which was entertaining, yet surprising. The relationship between Nikki and Virgil seemed a bit contrived. Didn't seem to have much chemistry holding them together. Overall a nice effort by Lochte and Darden.<br />Recommended for legal thriller fans.	2001-01-23
A good mystery	See storyline above.<br />Well I couldn't get as enthusiastic as some of these reviewers about this book, but it was a good mystery. It moves at a fairly good pace and keeps you guessing until the end. There are deceptions and coverups and a whole lot of insight into the White House. The character of Michael Garrick was hard to like because he seemed so pliable. Why keep putting up with Nora?<br />A great book for mystery lovers, with just enough thrills to keep you hooked until the exciting conclusion.<br />Recommended.	2001-01-19
A great thinker	See storyline above.<br />Daniel Hecht has written a superb novel that makes you think. I like that. A great intellectual thriller with action, suspense and emotion. A highly researched novel concerning genetics, and the idea that evil and violence can be hereditary or passed on via memes or virus's. A wide range of characters provide a wide array of opinions on this subject. Great subject. Great story. Great charcters.<br />Highly recommended for all.	2001-01-17
Not your normal Koontz	See storyline above.<br />I got hooked from the first few pages, thinking I'm in for a fast paced drama. Well, I got the drama. The pace lagged at times but because of Mr. Koontzs' writing style it was still great entertainmment. Such prose.<br />Although a little too spiritual, the fantasy Mr. Koontz has written has enough mystery and suspense to push it to the top of the bestseller lists. Some of the unique characters in the book include the brothers Jacob and Edom. Jacob is obsessed and knows all about man made disasters while Edom is the same about natural disasters. There are many characters in this novel with their own unique philosophies. The evil protaganist, Junior Cain, with a rather unorthodox way of recalling something, was a follower of the philosopher Caesar Zedd, whom I found to have some rather interesting outlooks on life.<br />At times emotionally gripping and full of surprises. At times preachy and annoying. A different sort of novel for Dean Koontz which should generate some new fans, and at the same time maybe lose some. Me? I look forward to what comes next.<br />Lightly Recommended	2001-01-12
International thrills	See storyline above.<br />I think Daniel Silva has done it again. Written a gripping and serious spy novel, that is. Although not as intense as his previous novels, The Kill Artist takes a top seat in the international spy genre. This international thriller, with well molded characters, will take you all the way from the Mideast to Paris and from London to Canada. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the main player in this book and Daniel Silva knows this topic well. The only problem I had with the book was the lack of gut wretching suspense that I come to expect with this type of novel (I guess I expected Ludlum). Still, a good spy novel with great characters and timely subjects, gives this one a high mark.<br />highly recommended for the serious international thriller fan.	2001-01-05

Keeps getting better	See storyline above.<br />I have to say that with each novel, Mr Cannell keeps getting better. The Tin Collectors is a gritty novel about corruption in the LAPD and the IAD. Mr. Cannell has an uncanny way of getting  good information about LAPD operations and also giving you a good picture into this organization. The pace moves rapidly making it hard to stop reading. Police drama at its finest.<br />Recommended for crime thriller lovers	2001-01-03
Almost there	See storyline above.<br />Steve Samuel's first novel of political intrigue reminded me a little of David Baldacci, though Baldacci is better by comparison. The pace moves steadily all the way to the somewhat predictable ending. The thrills are here, as is the suspense. For a first novel I think Mr. Samuel is on the right track. A couple things bothered me about the book, thus affecting the whole story. First is Mr. Montgomery's plan to keep multi-billionaire Sam Baldwin from going through with his assassination attempt. A kidnapping just seemed too amatuerish for this powerful man. Secondly what bothered me, was Sarah Peterson's assignment by the president to head security for the Secretary of State. Why her? Why now? Why didn't she? After her recording session she completely stayed away from him. At the time she had no reason to stay away. Seemed contrived. Of course that's just my opinion.<br />For a first novel I recommend this to political thriller fans and I look forward to Steve Samuels next effort.	2001-01-01
Good horror	See storyline above.<br />I really enjoyed this book involving Chase Dagger and Sara the shape-shifter. I must also mention Einstein the macaw, quite a bird in itself. There is mystery and there is horror and there is action, blended all together in this above normal tale of superstition. You really get to like most of the characters and their unique personalities. Lee Driver (aka Sandra Tooley) has written a very entertaining horror novel that will keep you in your seat till the sun comes up. I look forward to the next Dagger Mystery and hope that Sara tags along.<br /><br />Highly recommended for horror and mystery buffs.	2000-12-25
Luckily a short book	The year is 2054. Aurora Bell, an astronomy professor inFlorida, receives a message from outside the solar system that says&quot;We're coming&quot;. The source of the message is heading towardsearth and expected in three months time. During this 3 month period,the story takes you through the social fabric of the times. Designerdrugs are prevalent.  There are exotic sexual devices. A war is aboutto break out overseas in Europe.<br />Characters also take on a life oftheir own, though sometimes shallow. Such as Norman Bell and hisillicit sexual history and the extortionist by the name of Willie JoeCapra.<br />I did like the smooth transitions from chapter too chapterand some of the characters, but I thought the ending was rather dull.	2000-12-23
3 1/2 stars	Jay Sandek is hired for a job by his former employer, the CIA, to find a way to get Markham Fitch, a billionaire who is in sanctuary in Switzerland, to a place where he can be arrested. The methods used by Sandek are somewhat out of the CIA's area of legality. The quirky characters and odd the mannerisms of these characters, gave this novel a humorous edge. I see Sandek and his favorite drink, Corona, no lime, return for another adventure. Overall it was an enjoyable read, and quick.<br />Recommended.	2000-12-22
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Well, I have to disagree with a quite a few of the reviewers here and say that I found this to be a really enjoyable book. Fastpaced, suspenseful and very readable. I think that because the ending didn't satisfy most readers, their reviews were negative. I was surprised by the ending, which could have provided more closure, but I still enjoyed this book immensely. I look forward to the next Alex Cross novel.<br />If everyone had the same tastes in books, it would truly be a boring world.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-12-21
You gotta  like Wilford	A well written mystery. If you like Wilford Brimley, whom the protaganist is based on, and you like mystery's, you'll enjoy this book. A well written, yet, average mystery.<br />Recommended for Wilford Brimley fans.	2000-12-19
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />This is definitely a scientific thriller. The research and knowledge possessed by Mr. Powlik shows up in abundance in this tale of adventure. You'll learn a little bit about everything from Bacterial sciences to nuclear physics, tidbits of Chernobyl to the species balaenoptera. An adventure in the Artic should bring vivid pictures to the mind, and it does. Although there is more science than adventure in this novel, I liked it because I like science.<br />Recommended for science lovers who like adventure.	2000-12-16
Good psychological suspense	Tate Collier and his ex-wife Bett, are reunited to search for their missing daughter Megan, in this quite suspenseful psychological thriller. Aaron Matthews is a highly intelligent psychologist (and psycho) who can talk people into believing almost anything. The paths of Tate and Bett will soon cross with that of Matthews and we learn that something in Tate's past is the reason his daughter is missing.<br /> Filled with a few surprises and emotional situations, Deaver has written a satisfying story with some good characters. Matthews' use of language instead of tools (although tools are sometimes used) to knock his victims down, is a good change of pace. Overall, it's a good, quick entertaining read.<br />Recommended	2000-12-11
Not his best	See storyline above.<br />You can hardly go wrong by picking up a Follett book. He generally delivers top rated thrillers. I gave this book 4 stars because he's written a good story. The characters could have been established better, although with the flashbacks, you do get an idea of there personalities. This is definitely not his top of the line work, though it is better than most thriller writers. The author also does his research well. Throwing in tidbits about rocketry physics and mathematics, as well as the space program of 1958.<br />An exciting story well worth the read, but not his best.<br />Recommended.	2000-12-08
Fairly good horror	I started reading this thinking it would be a typical sewer monster story. It was a little more than that. An unknown creature is roaming the sewers of Warsaw, Poland. It's beheading all its victims in a brutal fashion. Sarah Leonard is in charge of getting a luxury hotel built in the city. When a few workers are killed, the other workers refuse to go back work until the murderer is caught (or the Devil as they call it). Detective Rej is in charge of the homicides and can't seem to find any connection between all the killings around the city. When a connection comes to light, it's to late, because he's been dropped from the case. Sarah decides to hire a detective from the states who's supposed to have great success in criminal investigations. Clayton Marsh is his name. It turns out that all the murders seem to be related to an event in the past.<br />Overall a captivating read. I found the character of Clayton Marsh, who supposedly had a brilliant mind, to be quite stupid. To search the sewers, knowing you'll meet the killer, without a weapon? Hello?<br />Fastpaced, with a little romance and a little money laundering, brought this gruesome and some time graphic novel together.<br />Recommended for older teens and lovers of horror.	2000-12-06
Noir	The protaganist con artist/thief known as Parker gets double crossed by three of his partners. In the ensuing story he seeks revenge. As he goes across the country acquiring money for his vengence, he crosses pathes with an unknown enemy that wants him dead. A very powerful enemy. The story moves at a rapid pace with a moderate amount of suspense. Somehow, you get a certain liking for this Parker character even though he is a thief and murderer. If you can feel any compassion for Parker, then I think you'll really enjoy this novel. If not, you'll come away unsatisfied. For me it was an entertaining read.<br />Recommend	2000-11-28
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />Eric Bogosian's first novel will make you look at the Mall in a different light. A fast read with a steady pace. Filled with drug induced teenagers and perverted adults, brings a sort of originality to this novel. The abrupt ending also caught me by surprise.<br />Recommend...Library	2000-11-27
Barely 3 stars	Carr's pessimistic view of the future and the preachy fashion in which it's presented made this book hard to finish, although with effort, I made it through. Carr's previous novels far surpassed this piece of work. The ideas and the plot definitely had potential, but Carr just couldn't quite fulfill it. This book seemed to be written more for Carr's ideas of the future, and not for thrills and suspense.<br />Recommend...The library	2000-11-24
3 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />I did find myself enjoying this mild thriller. It just didn't seem to grab my attention as much as others. From the abrupt beginning, on through too the end, I just didn't like the way the story was layed out. I usually don't notice this, but the characters seemed a little hard to get to know. For some reason I didn't care what happened to the protaganists. Lack of history? There are much better thrillers, but this one passed the day with a bit of enjoyment.<br />Recommend the library.	2000-11-20
Typical good Ludlum	See storyline above.<br />A bit of 007 mixed with some 'True Lies' gives you an idea of  what the new Ludlum thriller will give you. The protaganist Bryson gets into so many life and death situations during his deep cover operations, which he obviously always escapes, that you don't worry about him dying when he gets into another one. Bryson is definitely one of those heroes that's almost impossible to kill. This does make for great thrills though, because, as quoted above this review, this is escapist fiction. Nonstop, blood pulsing, twisting, turning, highspeed, whos who, back stabbing and front stabbing Action! One heck of a ride. Sure there are some flaws. How can you make a simple mistake like not knowing that the previous nights weather was severe storms (when they were running old footage over live footage). This,  personally, bothered me the most of the little things that didn't quite fit with the premise.<br />Overall an exceptional thriller.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-11-15
Great Entertainment	See storyline above.<br />As flat out entertainment, this is the book to read. One heck of a fun thriller. From laugh out loud to edge of your seat suspense. There are many entertaining factors about this book. The unusual accidents that occurred, the ones that could vie for the Darwin awards, were quite humorous, in a tragic sort of way, if not laugh out loud. You'll find insurance fraud takes on a whole new depth when the russian mafia gets involved. Dar's theory about the challenger accident was quite eye opening. You'll learn quite a lot about sniping also, in a suspenseful climax. With a Masters in physics, you'll find that not much gets by Darwin Minor. This is an all around entertaining book that will appeal to a wide group of people who like thrills and laughs.<br />Highly recommended<br />Darwins 5th law: Any organisms intelligence decreases in direct proportion to the number of heads it has.	2000-11-07
4 1/2 stars	See storyline above.<br />This is a well written novel that kept me at the edge of my seat. Well rounded with thrills and emotions. When you have cults, mixed with terrorism, during the apocalypse of the new millenium, what more can you expect than pure excitement. Robert Rice delivers. Keep up the good work Robert!<br />Highly recommended for thrills and adventures.<br />A rental car without a good credit card? Not likely.	2000-11-02
A timely novel	See storyline above.<br />This timely novel about terrorists and the Mideast has a riveting beginning, and doesn't let up till the end. I think people who like espionage novels will enjoy this book. From the twists and turns to the few surprises you'll find, this book will keep you engrossed from start to finish. Enjoy.<br />Recommended for readers of spy novels.	2000-10-31
Fun Read	I thought this was a fun book to read. As Dorfman goes back and forth between doctors and charlatans looking for a cure to his unknown ailment, he enlightens us about his past and his childhood, which of course, involves his somewhat strange parents. John Blumenthal has written a hilarious novel with a refreshing originality. I pictured the protaganist as a Martin Short type character that he had played in the movie 'Inner Space'.<br />One complaint I have is the quality of the publishers binding. The book was starting to fall apart when I started reading it and I had to treat it with great care to finish it. Not to worry. With the quality of writing that John Blumenthal is coming out with, I see a bigger and better publisher waiting in the wings.<br />Highly recommended for fun and laughs. You might just see a bit of your own self.	2000-10-19
Great Effort	This is another one of my rare 5 star books. This book was pure entertainment from start too finish. Written as a sequel, but reads just great by itself. I love supernatural thrillers and no one can beat F. Paul Wilson in this genre. If you want to read a feel good book where the bad guys always get their due, and in original ways, this book is for you. One great read!<br />Highly recommended.	2000-10-16
Good reading	See storyline above.<br />Tim Green obviously has no trouble writing about something other than football based novels, as this quite readable suspense novel proves. Just when you think you have it figured out and start cheering on the good guys, you read a little more and go oops! wrong one. Or is it? A good book with a lot of suspense and colorful characters. How about that Donald Sales guy, and what he does to prove a point? I also enjoyed the ending. Overall a very satisfying read. Keep it up, Tim Green, because Grisham has nothing on you.<br />Highly Recommended for legal thriller and suspense fans.	2000-10-12
Good first book	See storyline above.<br />Alex Kava-a female author-has written a good thrilling book. Not a lot of mystery, but quite a bit of suspense, made this story a quick read. The love story angle seemed to be a bit overdone to my liking, especially during a rather gruesome investigation of a serial murderer, who it appears, tortures single parent children before he kills them. There certainly aren't any happily married couples in this story. Overall, a highly graphic, yet satisfying read. Obviously written with a sequel in mind.<br />Recommended	2000-10-06
Great book	See Storyline above.<br />This, in my opinion,is one of those rare 5 star books. It packs a ton of action with an outstanding locale. You'll actually find yourself cheering for the good guys with enthusiasm. The two different plots in the book are weaved together with a fine touch. Jake Grafton must rescue his wife from a greedy criminal while at the same time rebels are trying to overrun the communists. This is one heck of a good read, and if action is on your list, don't miss this one.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-10-03
This is entertainment. 4  1/2 stars	Storyline above.<br />Elmore Leonard strikes again with another original novel that reaches from Genocidal Rwanda to the streets of Detroit. The novel moved at a fast pace and kept me reading into the night (as usual, for Leonard). The originality of the characters was refreshing as was the dialogue and humor. The massacres in Rwanda drew a sharp contrast compared to the activities in Detroit where most of the humor took place. I think Leonard pulled this contrast off real well and thus gave it an originality you don't often see.<br />Truly entertaining<br />Highly recommended.	2000-09-29
Par	See storyline above.<br />As far as the story goes, it is a real page turner. I must admit this is my first Sheldon novel. I'm a little disappointed in the brevity of his writing style. It reads somewhat like cliff notes. It is, no doubt, fast paced, but written in the summary style that it is, it would be hard to be slow paced. If you just want a fun read, and really quick, this is the book for you.<br />Recommended...For younger readers and older readers who like thrills.	2000-09-22
Fast	I really enjoyed this book and think it's Gilstrap's best so far. The action was fast paced and the emotion quotient ran high. For readers who like a quick wild ride, this is your vehicle. It seems the character you get to know best in the book is Samuel, the slow witted brother of a kidnapper. Other characterizations were adequate.<br />Highly Recommended for...Fast paced action and suspense with strong emotional situations.	2000-09-21
Mixed review	I found the book to be an entertaining read and think the author wrote a  good story. Though some of the scenarios with computer outages were a  little farfetched and hard to swallow, the adventure in the story covered  for it. I did notice some editing problems myself, but that didn't affect  the story much. I'm sure the editors heard a mouth full already. With each  book Pineiro writes he gets better. I look forward to his  next.<br />Recomended...for the thrills	2000-09-16
Not riveting	Story line above.<br />This thriller didn't hold my attention as it should  have. The second have did outpace the first have, but that wasn't enough  for me to give this a high recommendation. Very few of the characters were  very exciting. Of course Catherine was the most exciting, yet most  unbelievably potent, character in the novel. There are many more novels of  WW2 intrigue that out pace this one.<br />Recommend..Library	2000-09-13
4 1/2 star ride	See storyline above.<br />This, I think, is Margolin's best so far. It's one  of those stories that keep you guessing while you're on the edge of your  seat. A quick gratifying read indeed. At times gruesome and violent, with  descriptions of torture, it still comes of as a savvy thriller. I must  admit that I had the killer figured out at the two third area. Lucky  Guess.<br />Highly recommended...For a quick exciting read.	2000-09-08
Liked most of it.	Story line above<br />Overall I think David Hagberg does a fine job in his  latest thriller. The action and dialogue in the first two thirds of the  book is great. Towards the end it seemed that Hagberg couldn't keep it as  intense and I found myself drifting. I also found interesting,  McGarvey's-or is it Hagbergs?-love of the philosophy of  Voltaire<br />Recommended	2000-09-05
I drifted	I have never drifted as much with any other book. Meaning I would start  reading, and while I'm reading I would think about other things. I drifted!  The novel should have been condensed to about 600 hundred  pages.<br />Recommend....The library, even if you have to wait for weeks.	2000-09-01
4 1/2 stars	Story line above.<br />Robert Ludlum's collaboration with co-author Gayle  Lynds leaves little to be desired as far as thrills and action are  concerned. The story moves at a rapid pace that will keep you glued to your  chair, all the way to the suspenseful ending. At times you'll have to  suspend the believability, such as when you have all these powerful and  supposed respectful people willing to sacrifice what could be millions of  lives, for money. E.g. the Surgeon General? A Congressman? Top  Brass?<br />Overall a satisfying read. I intend to be a regular reader of this  new Covert-One Series.<br />Martin Zellerbach was quite a  character.<br />Recommended for an adventurous read.	2000-08-29
A Good read	This fast paced story about an unusual kidnapping kept me glued to the  pages. I found the dialogue between kidnappers and hostages quite  entertaining. Though, at times, it was somewhat predictable, the story kept  you on an emotional rollercoaster. The research regarding the airport and  tower scene could have been better (phraseology and control tower  functions). An overall good book.<br />Does... 'the kid always makes it'  really mean it?	2000-08-22
Just below par	I have read all of Fitzhugh's books. This was my least favorite, although,  I really did enjoy it. The hilarity was a bit more toned down than I would  have expected. There was a little more emotion and less intensity than  previous novels. An overall good read with some laughs. My rational mind  really enjoyed the religious barbs aimed towards....<br />Recommended	2000-08-20
4 1/2 stars	I truly enjoyed this comedic and at times horrific novel. This was a true pleasure to read. Characters such as Johnny Vegas and his attempts at  losing his virginity, too Boris 'the hateful piece of s###', lend an  originality I find refreshing. Though most characters are a bit shady, you  can't help but feel a little compassion for them. The book had a tendency  to jump around a little too much for me, but since I read it in a short  period of time, I could hang with it.<br />Highly recommended	2000-08-16
For younger readers	I just couldn't give more than 3 stars to this thriller. Basically a story  about a new quantum energy source discovered by an American scientist but  stolen by a Russian industrialist billionaire. The convenience of much of  the story was too much. For example, The ring switch and the digging up of  the parking lot. Everything fell too neatly in place. Since when do trained  Navy Seal snipers allow sun reflections off their scopes to be seen? I  think with a little more time, Tom Grace can come up with a better written  novel. Older teenagers will enjoy his books.<br />Recommend...Library	2000-08-14
Gripping mystery	James Grippando's latest kept me guessing the whole way. A missing wife  along with a serial killer on the loose can make for a predictable story,  but not in the hands of Grippando. The story kept me entertained  throughout, but I thought the second half was the better. Good mystery,  good thrills, and good suspense, kept me glued too the book till the  end.<br />Recommended	2000-08-09
great time killer	A great afternoon read. The adventures put forth by Cussler are by far one  of the most entertaining things to read. They are great fun...Higly  recommended.....	2000-08-06
So-So	I thought this book got a little more hype than it should have. None of the information in this book took me by surprise, yet there was some tidbits that entertained. Eszterhas' writing style did give the overdone  Clintoncapades a bit more readability and wit to entertain, but in the end,  it's the same willard story. The best part of the book is the supporting  cast.<br />Recommend...library	2000-08-02
First Hiaasen	Must admit this is my first Carl Hiaasen book...Loved it.<br />I was never sure which way the story would go. The originality and comedic touches were great. The characters and there eccentricities were outstanding. Everything  from Clapley's barbie doll fetish too Stoats' misquotes (from song lyrics)  too Mr. Gash and his need for a 911 fix. With the many interesting  characters and oddball situations, I found this to be one great  read.<br />Highly recommended...	2000-07-29
4 1/2 star winner	This prequel to the Swagger saga hits a home run.<br />Earl Swagger is a decorated veteran returning home from Iwo Jima, where he received the medal of honor. Owney Maddox is the gangster that runs the books, brothels, and  casinos at Hot Springs, which in 1946, is a city of wide corruption and  notoriety, attracting the rich and famous. A Mr. Becker, who is the new  prosecuting attorney, hires Swagger to train a group of men to clean up the  town. Earl Swagger does not let his impending fatherhood get in the way as  he deals with evils and betrayals and a rising body count.<br />I enjoyed this  book as much as his previous books. The writing jumps out at you like your  at a movie watching it all unfold. The history of Hot Springs (though here  made more violent, because afterall, its a Swagger novel) was quite  interesting. This is a highly action packed novel. Good vs evil, cops vs  gangsters. Of course 'Bugsy' makes his appearances also.<br />Highly  recommended	2000-07-22
4 1/2 stars	Another fine adventure from Preston and Child that doesn't disappoint.<br />Billionaire Palmer Lloyd usually gets what he wants. What he happens to want now is a 25,000 ton meteorite that's half buried on a  desolate island south of Cape Horn. Eli Glinn is hired by Palmer Loydd to  get this job done. Glinn runs a successful engineering company that has  never failed at any job its taken on. Sam McFarlane is also hired by Lloyd.  McFarlane's  knowledge of meteorites is needed and his old friend also just  happens to be the man who discovered this largest meteorite.<br />A darn good  read. Fast paced and almost believable. Intriguing reading begins with  Preston and Child. Keep it up...<br />Highly recommended	2000-07-18
Disappointed	This is not the novel I would take on vacation. This thriller just didn't cut it with me. It was just too fake. J.D. Cade's ease at getting so close to the President and his campaign just seems so far fetched, as was DeVitos  hatred and suspicions about him from their first meeting because he came  off as a rich man but didn't have a manicure.<br />Mr. Flynn's previous novel  'Digger' was much better than this recent effort.<br />My recommendation  is.....The library	2000-07-11

3 1/2 stars	A fairly good mystery with a hint of the supernatural.  This book reminded me of 'Psycho', with its somewhat odd family and shady history.

More good rants	The metaphorically talented Dennis Miller comes through with another fine performance with 'I Rant, Therefore I Am'. I listened to the 2 cd version.

Good Read	Quite the dilemma. To stay young or not. Once you take the elixir, you take it for life, or die a horrible death. There are quite a few things to think about in this book and Gary Braver pretty much hits on all the  consequences of most decisions. The pace of the book is fast. Maybe  sometimes too fast as far as skipping time periods. There is good (Chris  Bacon and family), there is bad (Quentin), and there is ugly (graphic  details). Of course, along with the good action, there is the evil  character of Antoine and the total idiot of Lamar Fisk. All  these things  bring this novel together to bring you some high brow entertainment along  with an emotional rollercoaster ride. Happy reading<br />Recommended	2000-06-23
3 1/2 stars	This is the story of a man who gets hypnotized at a faculty party, and during the hypnosis, reveals the he was Adolph Hitler in a previous life. This is revealed after he was an ostrich. The story progresses when Alan  Weston, a television reporter who happened to attend this party, reveals to  the public what happened. The public obviously believes this reporter  -because he's on TV- and soon all hell breaks loose, from vandalism to  murder.<br />The overall story is entertaining. The author has a good, yet  over enthusiastic, view of what the publics reaction would be. I see the  publics reactions to be not quite as stupid.<br />The pace of the story seemed  a little stretched, but with the twists and turns, it was still a good  read.<br />Recommended	2000-06-20
4 1/2 Stars	A great adventure lies ahead.<br />Danielle Barnea is an Israeli police officer. Ben Kamal is a Palestinian detective. A group of Archeologists are executed while at a site in the Judean desert. This starts the adventure  that brings Danielle and Ben back together again.<br />If you like Indiana  Jones adventures, you'll like this book. It's fast paced action all the  way. It has a tendency to go a little overboard on some of the action as  far as believability goes, but its still hyperdrive reading. As you read  through the twists and turns, from places like Boston to the North Sea,  you'll enjoy the ride, and at the same time see how relations between a  Palestinian and an Israelis can be a problem. One humorous note; Colonel  Al-Asi and his gambling 'inspections'.<br />Highly recommended..	2000-06-14
This cradle should fall	Abgd Rvw...I must concur with the majority on this book. James Patterson's work in the fantasy genre is terrible. The story moves quick enough but thats not enough to make this book good. The brevity of the chapters along  with the unbelievability of the story the way it was written, would have  made this book easy to pass up. Had I believed all the reviews and that Mr.  Patterson could write this bad I would have passed it up.<br />Recommend...No  purchase	2000-06-11
4 1/2 stars	This was the first Ben Bova Book I've read. I really liked it and intend to read more of his books. The action and adventure seems nonstop. I like it when an author can write scifi that seems plausible. Overall one heck of  a good story, and I'm glad I discovered another author to go on my 'must  read' list.<br />Highly recommended..Abgd rvw..	2000-06-07
4 1/2 stars	The talented Authors that put this book together combined to make a story that was very entertaining. Fast paced, non-stop readability! Sometimes erotic, sometimes violent, often darkly humorous. This is the rare gem that  you'll likely read in a day, whether your a golfer or not. Unique  characters along with a great story and locale bring this very original  book together nicely.<br />Highly recommended	2000-05-30
A good read	Lincoln Rhyme travels to North Carolina for an experimental operation that might improve his almost total paralysis. Luckily his mind is more acute than ever. Lincoln, and travel companion Sachs, are sidetracked into  helping the local sheriff solve a kidnapping and murder. But things aren't  what they appear to be.<br />This is a well paced novel that will keep you  guessing with its twists and turns. It will give you a good idea what it  feels like in the swamps of NC. The characters in the book seem to jump out  at you, especially the 'Insect Boy' from whom you'll learn quite a bit  about insects.<br />Overall a very satisfying read<br />Recommended	2000-05-29
Outstanding	If you want to read one book this year that will keep you so entertained, you'll not be able to stop reading (cliche'd but true), this is it. The surprises in store for the readers is amazing. Simply one of the best  adventures of the year (so far).<br />Highly recommended...	2000-05-26
3 1/2 star story	The basic premise of this book tells the story of a man's run for the presidency. Its a straight forward novel (forgive the redundancy) with few surprises. This is not a top of the line thriller by any means, but the  storyline is fast and to the point. With the thrills being few, the story  is more about the goings on behind the scenes, and the angst and glory that  goes along with politics. There are some manipulative, as well as criminal,  characters spread throughout the novel that give it an overall fast  pace.<br />A quick read...<br />recommend...Library	2000-05-23
Outstanding!!!!	I would like to thank Dan Brown for such an outstanding novel. The only  bad thing about this thriller is the fact that I'll have to read a lot more  books to find one thats even near as entertaining and riveting as this one.  The research was exceptional. The secrets that lie in wait for the reader  will amaze you. The history and life in the Vatican, the story of the  Illuminati, the science and research in physics, Galileo.  These are just  some of the things you'll learn about while on this rollercoaster ride of a  book.<br />A true 5 Star if ever there was one....<br />Highest  recommendation........	2000-05-17
4 1/2 Like a free fall..	Kyle Mills Latest novel makes you feel like your in a 'free fall'.  Exhilarating, suspenseful and drop dead readable.Mark Beamon is a suspended  special agent for the FBI who has a reputation for finding people who don't  want to be found. He is hired by an unknown client, whos willing to pay  well, to find a world class rock climber that happened to acquire top  secret files that could topple some very high level politicians.This book  was a great enjoyment to read. The hatred you'll feel towards Hallorin and  his 'at all costs' run for the presidency, to the chuckles you'll have as  Darby and Beamon ski there way to the tower, are just a couple of emotions  you'll have while reading this book.There is very little filler or  superfluous narration to bog you down.The ending, to me, was a little  disappointing, but yet, justice was served. Keep'em coming Mr. Mills Highly  recommended..	2000-05-09
Not real thrilling	Philip Kerr's latest involves Americas deadliest assassin Tom Jefferson. Jefferson is hired by the mob to kill Castro. After accepting money for the job, he happens across a secret recording of JFK having a go at his wife (who happens to work on JFK's campaign). This causes Jefferson to change  targets. Due to his failure to follow through with the Castro  assassination, the Mob now targets him.<br />The novel takes place in 1960 and  '61 and has been researched real well. From the songs that were popular to  the talk shows and movies (Psycho). The novel lacks suspense. We know no  assassination takes place in '60 or '61. It also lacks a protagonist to  cheer for. Most characters in the novel are crooked and corrupt. The  reading was dry.<br />Philip Kerr's previous novels 'Esau' and 'A five year  plan' were, in my opinion, much better books. As a thriller writer, I feel  Philip Kerr has slipped a notch with this latest  effort.<br />Recommendation...Library	2000-04-30
Don't waste your money	First off I'd like to say that the information in this book,8 so called secrets,is valuable. Mr. Edelman explains it in an easy to understand way. The reason I say not to waste your money is this. Each secret has a chapter  with an average length of 11.5 pages. So basically the good information is  in about 90 some pages. The rest of the book is filled with the authors'  clients telling you how they do the things that the book says. In my  opinion this should be a 100 page book at the most. It took me 2 hours to  get all the valuable information out of this book(it is good information).  I think the author expanded most of his energy trying to sell you his other  books by the numerous footnotes telling you to by his other books. He was  trying to be humorous most of the time with the footnotes but it became  annoying.<br />My recommendation is..The library	2000-04-26
Readable	I actually enjoyed this biography quite a bit. It surprised me somewhat to learn how aggressive and cunning Geffen was. The back stabbings and lies are all part of the reason for Geffen's success but I still admire his ambition to get to the top. Overall a well balanced biography that, in some  cases, doesn't go into enough detail. Overall, I find Mr. Kings writing  style quite smooth and easy to read. Recommeded.	2000-04-25
Irresistable..almost	Ethan Black's newest novel &quot;Irresistable&quot;, is almost that. It grabs you from the first page and keeps you reading. The characters Nora Clay and Conrad Voort seem to come right off the pages. A well written  novel. The only flaw was the strong anti-abortion stance the author  obviously tries to convey. Recommended.....	2000-04-20
4 1/2 stars. Great read	Must go along with the consensus in that this is Michael Palmer's best book to date. This fast paced novel grabs you by the greens and straps you to the gurney. A well researched story line combined with realistic  characters makes for a very enjoyable read. I particularly liked Alex's odd  snacking habit...Highly recommended	2000-04-16
RUN...from this	Would it be that hard to add quotation marks? This style of writing is terrible! The story-if you can get through it-is quite good. The fact that this author uses no quotation marks makes for a slower read. It slows the  reading down immensely when you have to stop and figure out 'is this  narrative or a character talking?' This seems to me to be lazy writing as  opposed to artistic writing. I do not recommend this book for that simple  reason. I do, however, recommend that you read an excerpt before you  seriously consider purchasing this book. In my opinion there is way too  much dialogue in this book to be written in this manner	2000-04-08
actually 1/2 star	Don't waste your time trying to decipher this supposed novel. Will make a good paper weight. Fortunately I got a copy from the library and didn't waste my money. Don't let the good reviews fool you. Check it out at the  library first....	2000-04-08
Thrilling read	Paul Garrison's latest novel reminds me greatly about the movies 'Die Hard 2' and 'Godzilla'. The story takes place in New York City and the protagonists take on impossible odds. The action is nonstop. Like the  movies mentioned above, the believability of the plot is not something you  should dwell on, though it makes for a great read. There was one character  in the book that kept annoying me...&quot;Jose wants to know&quot;. You'll  figure it out when you read it. Recommend this as a Quick Summer read...	2000-04-07
Hook with sinker	The Hook starts out with the impression that you'll be in for a great ride. This ride slows down towards the middle of the book. The suspense is not here. The suspense that could have been, isn't. The actual murder  happened before it could even begin to get suspenseful. The relationship  between Bryce and Wayne struck me as really odd and the agreement seemed  all to casual to seem real. This was a quick, interesting read, but nothing  I'd go out of the way to recommend..	2000-04-04
Will give 3 and 1/2 stars	This is one of those novels where its not really a problem to put the book down and take a break. The writing style is such that it just doesn't grab you and not let you go. It is well researched and brings back some history  that I've forgotten involving General Patton and his ideals and opinions.  The action-when it occurs-seems abrubt. The details could have been more  interspersed with the action to create a more fluid and suspenseful read.	2000-03-31
Outstanding	Truly a full circle novel. The writing style itself is great. In my opinion this is one of the best novels I've read in the last 2 years and I am an avid reader. It does get graphic at times but so does life. The  squeemish will shudder. If you want a truly exciting read this year, I  highly recommend 'A Slow Burning'.	2000-03-22
Not worth the day..	It takes to read this sophmoric novel. Cliche'd, predictable, abrubt, summarized. Reads like cliff notes. Worst Higgins novel I've read. Please take your time with the next book Mr. Higgins	2000-03-15
Research Required	I enjoyed this book very much. Good action, good story and good pace. BUT, as usual, when it comes to air traffic control, it needed more research. When an aircraft loses its radio its called a NORDO aircraft. Meaning it  has no rdo(the abbreviation for radio in atc). The whole accident procedure  when the aircraft landed was also erred. Research is what this novel lacks  and that is why people in the field of aviation and air traffic should read  this with a grain of salt.	2000-02-26
