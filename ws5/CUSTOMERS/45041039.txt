(RAW Rating: 4.5) - He Looks Like Mr. Right, But Is He?	Momma used to say, \\"What looks good ain't always good for you.\\"  In our natural pursuit of a mate, we all tend to look at a pretty face, a tight body, a sweet smile or a seemingly nice personality not realizing that what we're looking at is what Momma tried so hard to warn us about-a diabolical predator.  Predators can be found anywhere and they can prey on anything.  They look darn good, they know how to use what Mother Nature gave them and they know how to manipulate and use people for evil purposes.  They truly love to see, touch and inflict emotional pain on the unsuspecting.  But, THE DEVASTATION OF MR. DRAKE by Ron Houston takes inflicting emotional pain to a new level with one such predator named Russell Drake.<br /><br />Russell describes himself as a mixologist in his position at the Satellite Lounge.  He doesn't consider himself just a bartender, but something more along the lines of a total package in the lounge environment. He has studied the science of alcohol and mixing drinks, so he knows how to make the complicated drinks and serve a regular beer.  He not only listens to the patrons' problems, but he makes them feel better by paying attention to the small things others would miss, telling a few jokes and in many instances making some dreams come true.  His well-toned, well-endowed body and charming demeanor are a huge turn-on for many of the female patrons and a source of some disguised jealousy among the males.  Unfortunately, evil lurks in his shadow.  The lounge is his personal breeding ground for the evil havoc he wreaks in the lives of many women.  His sole purpose in life is to exploit the pain of women to satisfy his all-consuming hatred for them.<br /><br />Mr. Houston has definitely crafted an alarming and staggering piece of fiction.  The main character just seemed to ooze sexuality from every pore, but was also laced with heavy doses of evil.  I didn't know whether to run for the hills to hide in fear or go looking for an exact replica to have at home.  I will never look at a bartender the same again. As much as I hate to admit it, there are many women who are lulled by sweet words and good looks, making themselves easy prey for the sadistic mind games.  The realistic way in which Houston writes, lets me know that although this is fiction, it can really happen.  This is a thriller that could get your imagination working in more ways than one.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerslica to have at home.

Are you enjoying a blessed love walk with God?	Take a moment and really think about the following questions.  Do you love God?  Do you love mankind as God does?  Do you feel your actions speak love?  Will others see love emanate from you?  Are you beginning to feel a little uncomfortable?  When doing deep and personal introspection, these can be some very tough questions.  But the right answer to them is so necessary in the Kingdom of God.  In LOVE, LIVE AND ENJOY LIFE: UNCOVER THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF GOD'S LOVE, Dr. Creflo A. Dollar takes an in-depth look and analysis at what it means to walk in love with God.<br /><br />Dr. Dollar starts out by telling us what love is and how important it is in your relationship with God.  He says love is a force, that when in operation, will rearrange things and change people and circumstances.  Operating without it will hinder our relationship with the Master and prevent His ability to work in our lives.  He then goes into how God defines love and thoroughly covers areas where we need to be more diligent when walking in love.  He ends this book with prayers and confessions designed to help and inspire anyone with their love walk.<br /><br />Dr. Dollar has crafted an uplifting yet humbling book on what God requires from all Christians in the area of love. The author gave life to a subject that many Christians sometimes don't put any real effort into other then a few terms of endearment uttered on Sunday morning.  They fail to realize that love is not just in lip service, but also in actions and deeds all the time.  In this book, he has given them the knowledge and the tools necessary to bring about change that will enhance their relationship with the Father.  The message in each chapter was clearly presented with all the necessary scriptural references and some of the author's own testimonies.  After reading this book, no one can feign ignorance about what God truly desires in his Kingdom.  I believe this is a life-changing book, for it has left a great impression on my life.  If you yearn to know about the transforming power of God's love, please get a copy of this book.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Finding love	In THEN I FOUND YOU, author Simona Taylor introduces readers to ex-professional football player turned security consultant, Damon Saint Rose.  Damon and his partner, Leshawn, have a very successful business in the field of security.  In fact, with the exception of one very serious catastrophe, things are running smoothly, as long as Damon stays away from female clients and all thoughts of love.  Leshawn, on the other hand, decides to help another friend in need, which causes him to take an assignment for Damon that involves protecting a woman.  The woman is none other than Kenya Reese, a budding celebrity in the movie industry who has been painted unjustly as a sexual fiend in the tabloids.  At first, Damon is adamantly opposed to providing security services for Kenya, but Leshawn talks him into it, and he finally agrees.<br /><br />Kenya's reputation is taking a beating in the press.  After firing her previous manager and lover, some awful things have found there way into the press about her.  But none of the publicity has been bad enough to nose-dive her career, yet.  With all that is going on in her life professionally, someone is also trying to destroy her family.  Against the advice of her current manager, she goes to Trinidad to confront the source of her anguish.  When she arrives at the airport in a bad disguise, she literally bumps into Damon, who promptly informs her that he is the bodyguard her manager hired.  Of course, sparks fly, but Damon doesn't relent, and they make it to Trinidad where those sparks turn into a mutual attraction.  As Damon helps Kenya confront her fears of someone trying to harm her and her family, he must also confront that which has made him a prisoner of his own guilt and fear.<br /><br />Simona Taylor has written a heart-warming, romantic tale about finding love in the least likely of circumstances.  With her pen, the author whisked the two main characters and readers away to the beautiful island of Trinidad, giving us all a taste of the island.  Although the imagery was magnificent, I did not get completely lost in it and forget that the characters had some serious issues and flaws to deal with.  He was trapped in the past and needed to learn how to let go.  She was trapped in the present and needed to learn how to love and trust again.  And they both needed to find each other.  This was a very nice and cozy read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersl a taste of the island.

Internet Vengeance	Three women, tired of the current dating scene in search of Mr. Right, but what each finds is something that will change their lives forever.  Arianna is so caught up in a man's physical appearance that she may miss the opportunity of a lifetime by looking for the perfect male specimen online.  Nicole compromises her faith to keep her online beau.  Janelle, running very low on self-esteem, allows her online interest to deplete her finances as he helps increase her sense of self worth through other means.<br /><br />The amazing truth that these ladies face is that their Mr. Right is the same man, Chauncey.  Chauncey has turned Internet dating into a sport.  His field of play is the entire United States and any woman who is vulnerable and susceptible to his lines.  Arianna, fed up with his game, decides it's time to go after her own brand of Internet justice.  Unable to get Nicole and Janelle to buy into a plan for vengeance, she hooks up with another of Chauncey's victim to hatch a scheme designed not only to teach him a lesson about toying with the affections of a Black woman, but to strip away his pride as well.  When the plan goes awry, the consequences may not be a lesson learned for Chauncey only.<br /><br />In BUSTED, Rhonda Swan has written an amusing yet poignant tale about dating and the Internet.  With so many people turning to the Internet to find love, Ms. Swan touched on many of the possible problems and situations a well-intending person could encounter.  I was really caught up in the revenge scenario and could really feel and understand why Arianna would go to such lengths, but later realized also why we should leave all our battles to the good Master. Revenge plots can spin out of control and bring consequences that are unexpected for those doing the maneuvering.  I really enjoyed the fast-paced plot and getting to know the characters.

(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Identity theft	Josephine (Josie) Ferrell grew up with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth.  Her adoptive parents saw to her every need and comfort.  When her mother passed away during her childhood, her father simply doted on her even more.  When he dies, her whole world is turned upside down.  While grieving over the loss of her dear father, Josephine finds out she has a twin sister and meets her during the funeral.  What a wonderful thing to happen during such a tragic time, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />Michelle Andrews was anything but the loving twin in search of her biological sister.  Michelle grew up surrounded by poverty and abuse.  Everyday was a struggle for her.  She has been on the wrong side of the law for a long time, and now she sees her sister as the answer to her prayers. She wants her sister's life.  After insinuating herself into Josie's life and home, Michelle begins to maliciously plot to switch identities with her sibling.  One day Josie wakes up in a mental institution in a heavily drug-induced state, wondering why everyone keeps calling her \\"Michelle.\\"<br /><br />The blue-eyed Dr. William Hayes sees the bed-prone ebony beauty and is immediately transported back in time when he met Josie Ferrell while she was singing at a jazz club.  He realizes instantly that the woman whose eyes he now stares into is the same one he fell in love with all those years ago, and she is definitely not Michelle Andrews.  And what's more, no one believes him either.  Realizing that something unpleasant has happened to Josie, William decides to risk his job and a possible jail sentence to rescue the love of his life, and just in the nick of time.  As bodies begin turning up left and right, the two try to stay alive and out of prison.  But, their close proximity to one another gradually rekindles the love they once shared.<br /><br />In DEADLY DOUBLE, Adrianne Byrd forays again into the romantic suspense genre with a sinisterly evil take on the good twin/bad twin storyline. She does a very decent job of combining this often-used plot to ferret out a unique story concerning issues relating to mental disorders and interracial dating, while allowing a love story to brew in the background.  I especially liked the way the book opened, with our heroine already being whisked away from the institution and readers later being brought up to date in flashbacks while the story continued to trudge on.

Words of love	FOR U WHO LEFT ME WHILE I SLEPT is a collection of 86 poems by Torrance Stephens.  Each poem is dated and appears to be a journal entry that charts his journey in the world of love.  The poems speak volumes concerning the joys of falling and being in love, the very sensual side of a relationship and the unfortunate pain of heartbreak and break up. My favorite of the collection is \\"The Beautiful One  4.16.86.\\"  It tells of a relationship where the woman has moved on, but the author tantalizes her with the memories of how the passion they once had surpasses anything she could possibly have now. He tells her, \\"for i am the flame that burns your soul tickles your panties and bends your toes.\\"  The words actually caressed my senses and forced me to journey down memory lane with a smile. I was also able to feel the sorrow in the writer as he lamented about his lost love in the title poem, \\"For U Who Left Me While I Slept 4.12.86.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Stephens is very gifted and talented with the pen.  He has put together a unique collection of thought-provoking verses that will inspire one to really think about love and its consequences.  His style took a little getting used to, as there are no capital letters in any of the poems and some only have a date as a title.  The majority of the poems were easy to grasp and understand, while a few took some thought and visualization.  In all, I was amazed at how some spoke to me, a person who does not normally read poetry.  If you are a lover of poetry, Mr. Stephen's collection of verses will be a nice addition.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-09-03
Charting the Course	When it comes to education, all parents strive for the very best for their children, but background and family differences as well as circumstances can alter those plans.  For years, we as African American parents have experienced the sad educational outcomes that relates to our children not having the same advantages as many White American children.  In the second printing of HIGHER GROUND, Leah Latimer provides Black parents with a guide that is intended to chart a successful course for their children from kindergarten to college.<br /><br />Latimer has written an invaluable and resourceful handbook that will save many Black parents from years of anguish.  She arms parents with the truth about our educational system and a definite plan of action aimed at guiding their children through high school, to college and how to pay for it all.  She recommends beginning in kindergarten, but if your child is older, she shows you where to start at any age group.  Her advice is prudent and very hard to ignore.  She also uses advice from educators, students, professionals and parents to drive home all her points.  Her dialogue is very lively and optimistic throughout.  I was completely captivated by the information in this book and will definitely use the knowledge I've gained to start planning my child's educational future.  The main thing I've learned is in this age of skyrocketing tuition costs, there is a way.  This book is a must have for every Black parent.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - Secrets, Secrets, Secrets...Everybody has a Secret	In her first novel, SANGUINE SECRETS, novice Mariposa Jones dives into a tale that spans hundreds of years about the loves and secrets of a breed of vampires who live and mate among mortals. Leiandros, the ruler of the vampire nation, meets and falls in love with a human named Simone in a small caf&eacute;.  His love for her outweighs the tradition of intermingling with his own kind.  When he reveals his secret life to Simone, she chooses to stand by him and live in his world. Together they produce a child named Nadirah.  Nadirah is no ordinary child.  She is part royal vampire and part human.  Her blood is the purest and can kill a regular vampire.  Her blood can also awaken the sleeping evil vampires who have been punished by the Vampire Council and locked away for centuries. There are those who want her dead because of the potential blood lust she could unleash, then there are those who would like for her be able to live a normal life.  Staying alive is something that may be hard to do, especially if all the secrets don't kill her first.<br /><br />Mariposa Jones has written an interesting and fast-paced account of a vampire nation who love just as hard as they hate.  This intoxicating storyline had many hair-raising, spine-tingling twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.  Ms. Jones is definitely a skilled storyteller; however, her delivery may need a little work.  The story began with a prologue that covered roughly a third of the book and the layout was confusing.  Many of the scenes used in the prologue to set the tone for the book were conspicuously absent of names, which did not connect well with characters in the rest of the book.  I was constantly flipping back and forth trying to figure out who was who and how they were linked.  Characters, some named and some not, were introduced at random with what appeared to be no significant relation to the main characters or it was addressed much later in the book.  There were also a few typographical and grammatical errors to navigate.  Overall, it was a good read, but with some tightening this could be a great book and a great series, should Ms. Jones decide to go there.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Setting an example	In her book, THE SISTER'S GUIDE TO IN-DEPTH BIBLE STUDY, Ms. Johnson focuses on African-American women and urges us to not only study God's Word, but digest it.  Although life can be cumbersome and we often don't have enough time, she urges us to make time.  Preparation, planning and creating an environment conducive for reflection and learning is key.  Additionally, Johnson offers up seven steps which she refers to as the seven P's, to follow as a guide when beginning your own personal Bible Study.  This approach encourages the student to take notes in an outline type of format and apply various learning techniques to comprehend the Bible and apply it to daily living.<br /><br />Although Ms. Johnson's book may not be anything new to even the average Bible student, her explanation of the process, the examples she uses and the flowing manner in which she writes, struck a chord with me.  It reinforced the inductive study approach I had used many years ago, but it also added a new twist with the outline style format.  The method introduced by Ms. Johnson can be applied to your personal study or used with a group as well.<br /><br />Appendix A in the back of the book includes a leader's guide with helpful suggestions for Bible study leaders.  Appendix B includes a wonderful diagram explaining the different translations of the Bible.  Also included in the appendices are a resource guide in which Johnson recommends such tools as commentaries and Bible encyclopedias.  All in all, this book is small but mighty!  I believe it could be an excellent tool when applied to encourage the in-depth study of the Bible.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

The animals feel safe because they know if problems arise, Blue Eagle with his watchful eye will save the day.  Blue Eagle is strong and quick and doesn't hesitate to send ill-intending creatures packing.  In the book THE BALLAD OF BLUE EAGLE, an array of animals have gotten together for a game of \\"Sneak and Peek\\" (their version of hide and seek) when Clugar the Carnivorous Cougar comes prowling.  The animals must scurry to save themselves and hope Blue Eagle will come to save the day.<br /><br />THE BALLAD OF BLUE EAGLE is an exciting tale about a lively group of animal characters.  Written in rhyme, the book has a fun cadence that will keep even the youngest of readers listening intently.  The story's style is characteristic of a fable, with moral messages about friendship, accepting differences, and avoiding violence wrapped into an engaging tale about a typical day in Pleasant Valley.  The author introduces elements of humor which include witty character names such as Grady the Gopher, Mortimer Mole, and best of all Toby the Turple (a purple turtle).  While the length of the book may be a bit much for young readers to absorb in one sitting, the author has included chapter breaks, providing logical points to stop and resume the story later.  In addition, the story's suspense will leave youngsters eager to return to this book.  With vivacious illustrations and a well-written story that is just plain enjoyable, THE BALLAD OF BLUE EAGLE is a sure winner, and I hope to see these wonderful characters again in future works.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

Wisdom Unfolded	History, the basis of learning, can sometimes be drawn out and overwhelming.  Not so in SAPPHIRES AND SATIN: Beauty of Black Soul. Although this is a poetry book and not a history book, Mrs. Ross does an excellent job in setting the stage for reflection, appreciation and thankfulness in her poems which are broken down into one of four topic matters:  When the Spirit Moves, Ain't Nothing Like Sisterhood, Home and Love Notes.<br /><br />Many of the poems are written from personal experience and allow the reader to reflect on common subjects, such as slavery, spirituality, love and family experiences from someone else's perspective. In order for the richness of these poems to be recognized one has to be patient and not read hastily.  One of my favorite poems was \\"Surrender.\\" It's a poem that makes you remember and appreciate the moment you became aware of yourself and were able to go to the next stage of your life wiser and humbler.  There were times I found myself struggling with the flow of some of the poems, however, overall this book of poetry will be enjoyed by poetry lovers as well as anyone who appreciates the contributions of African-Americans.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kirste Young<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

Kingston Phillips is an entertainment executive based in Chicago who has carved her way into the industry, nabbing one of the top rappers for her new division and garnering the respect of her boss.  All is lining up well for Kingston, and she has two good friends who share in her happiness and a kinda-sorta boyfriend in the wings.  Or so it seems.  Just as things start running smoothly, her grandmother dies, and she must return to Jamaica for the funeral.  In addition, she finds out some things about her boyfriend that make her realize she's better off without him.<br /><br />While in Jamaica, memories overtake Kingston as she deals with the death and funeral arrangements, her situation back home, and the decisions she has to make regarding her future.  She encounters family drama with those who should be closest to her and is forced to relive events of the past, including tragedy and heartache.  Kingston also finds out that her grandmother has named her the executor of her estate.  This causes more stress between the family members, and Kingston is left to decide how she will proceed with her sanity intact.  Kingston has much soul-searching to do as she later finds out her grandmother not only made her executor of her estate, but with the request that Kingston return to Jamaica and live in the house so she can oversee the estate fund.  Added to the chaos is the fact that her ex-boyfriend lives in town, and he's trying to pick up where they left off in their relationship.  Kingston must decide what she will do professionally, personally, and romantically, but it is all easier said than done.<br /><br />Though the novel is fiction, it touches on many aspects of other genres such as romance, a bit of suspense, and a bit of drama found in relationship-type novels.  There is something for everyone.  The writing isn't overly complicated, the characters are well-structured, and portions of the book were so moving, I found myself feeling as if I were part of the cast and actually going through the ups and downs featured in the book.

(RAW Rating: 2.5) - Are you ready to delve into Dorrie's diary?	Author and entertainment journalist Dorrie Williams-Wheeler has written an autobiography about her life entitled SPARKLEDOLL.COM: Reflections, Celebrity Interviews, and Behind the Scenes, with Author and Pop Culture Critic Dorrie Williams-Wheeler.  It is a compilation of her thoughts, actions, and experiences organized into diary entries, articles, short stories, and excerpts from her other books. She begins the book by informing the reader that she wears many hats; writer, designer, critic, and ends the book with several random thoughts on a variety of topics. It has a conversational tone and reads like a personal diary, moving through subjects such as weight loss, childbirth, and the processes involved with writing a novel.  Additionally, she shares how she transitioned from screenwriter to published author and entertainment journalist.<br /><br />SPARKLEDOLL.COM also includes a chapter on the concept to conception details of various websites she has operated over the years and why she started them, such as imissthe80s.com.  Williams-Wheeler was feeling nostalgic for the 80's and couldn't find an 80's site that had everything she wanted, so she started one.  She is still into musicians such as Duran Duran, The Go Go's, The Bangles, and Billy Idol.  This was surprising because I thought she would have been into more African-American artists like LL Cool J and Kool Moe Dee from that time period, but she does mention En Vogue.  The book also includes celebrity interviews taken from her website thabiz.com with Cassidy, Towanda Braxton, Talib Kweli, JoJo, and Nivea; many of whom I had never heard of, so it may be a regional thing.  The interviews would've made a good addition, but were a bit repetitious and boring.<br /><br />SPARKLEDOLL.COM is a one-of-a-kind book.

Who are we really?	Joseph L. Graves, a professor of Evolutionary Biology, explains in THE RACE MYTH precisely why Americans insist that race does exist even though genetically, as human beings, we are pretty much the same. The exception are differences caused by geography or environment. Examples we have all heard are the genetic diseases that certain \\"races\\" are more susceptible to such as sickle cell anemia in black people. He showed that although the people of Syria and Ghana don't look alike, they share they sickle cell gene and malaria. Kenyans and Ghanaians do resemble each other but the similarities end there. The Kenyans don't have the sickle cell gene, which is a defense mechanism against malaria, because in the high altitudes of Kenya, there are few mosquitoes and none carrying malaria. This is an example of how environment and geography play an important part in genetics.<br /><br />He explains that the race myth exists in America as an outgrowth of European dominance. When they first landed in the New World, they sought aid and advice from the indigenous people but that quickly faded as they decided to take the land from the previous owners. In addition, they began to import stolen Africans to cultivate the large tracts of land in their search for wealth. In order to make the system work, they had to establish the idea of \\"race\\" and along with that, the notion of superiority and inferiority. The Europeans were of superior intelligence, Indians down a notch and Africans on the bottom. According to Graves, this structuring of \\"race\\" is actually a social construct to maintain control. These ideas have persisted and are obvious in the distribution of employment, education and wealth in America. He goes on further to explore the myth that African Americans are more athletically inclined than European Americans including the history of the NBA and how and when African Americans began to \\"dominate\\" that sport.<br /><br />In conclusion, Graves calls for each of us to do our part in dismantling this social construct and to work for justice and equality. While he admits that everyone will not read or heed this book, history has shown that even small groups can bring about change and he urges us to do our part.<br /><br />Even though I've been hearing that race was a social construct, I have never seen it broken down and explained so thoroughly. Graves does an excellent job of giving us the scientific facts with the social examples to back his arguments. He demonstrates time and again how similar we are as human beings. He explains the so called gap in African American and European American scores on tests such as the SAT, the LSAT and the GRE, which are used to determine which students go to what college or university. He explores the poverty, the under funded educational systems that exist in this country and how that affects the outcomes. He does a marvelous job of showing how this is by design and not by accident. He most definitely takes the authors of The Bell Curve, Herrnstein and Murray, to task for reenergizing the claim that genetics explained the differences in test scores. I would recommend this book for all thinking human beings.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZReviewersart in dismantling this social construct and to work for justice and equality.

Scheming Doesn't Pay	Scheming doesn't pay.  This is the lesson that Rashid Smith has never learned. Rashid is a 23 year old, inner-city gay male who knows what he wants and how to get it, which basically means by any way possible.  However, Rashid soon realizes that the one thing he really wants most in life is the love of a good man.<br /><br />The lust of Rashid's life is Troy.  I use the word lust and not love intentionally. Rashid thinks he's in love with Troy, but it doesn't keep him from jumping into bed with a long-time crush. He will do anything to keep Troy from not finding out, including murder. Rashid lives in the fast lifestyle of gay Philadelphia where he participates in unprotected sex with various partners and schemes for fast money. He lives in a world of self-doubt and insecurity and only wants someone to love him. After the breakup with Troy, Rashid meets Calvin, an 18 year old high school student, who brings the love that Rashid so desperately desires. Calvin comes with baggage which includes baby mama drama and sexual liaisons with different partners.<br /><br />Smoking Cigarettes was well-intentioned and character driven. The plot had many twists and turns with dramatic flair. The flow of the story was hard to follow at times because there were just too many characters to keep up with. I found myself flipping back and forth throughout the story because new characters were constantly being introduced. It was as if I was reading a tabloid story rather than a novel. Hall tried to portray a realistic gay lifestyle, but it confused the plot and the reader. Many of the supporting characters could have been eliminated.  With that aside, I liked Rashid's story. He was similar to Winter from the Coldest Winter Ever. Rashid and Winter were both connivers and schemers who suffered from self-doubt and insecurity. Their lives were filled with constant drama and brand-new schemes on every page. Rashid's  life was a new drama every time I turned the page. He was on an unending search for a new audience to entertain. Rashid's underlying insecurity sparked deep depression and never-ending questions of self-worth. The bouts of depression he endured were throughout the story.  He just couldn't figure out that he was his own worst enemy.<br /><br />Reviewed by Richell Winchester<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersing search for a new audience to entertain.

Can a dream become a nightmare?	When Morris \\"Mookie\\" Lovett wins a rap contest, he leaves his familiar life in Orlando, Florida and goes to ritzy Los Angeles, California.  With his superb hip-hop skills, good looks, and charisma, he feels he is destined for stardom.  His girlfriend Pam and best friend Fatimus follow him to Los Angeles with dreams of their own success.  Once the trio arrives in L.A. they experience the effect of Mookie's fame, fans, fortune, and unfortunately, females.  The  conclusion of this book lets us see how Mookie deals with success, how Pam deals with Mookie's infidelity, and how Fatimus learns how to look out for himself.<br /><br />The story was so realistic that I would not be surprised if it were true.  There are several major conflicts that are dealt with very maturely in this book:  the depth of friendships, the relationship between a father and his son, the difference between platonic love and amorous love, how a young man deals with quick fame and fortune, and how deadly and addictive illegal drugs can be and their effect on your life choices.  The most popular theme is \\"what is done in the dark will eventually come to light.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed Michael T. Owens' writing style and felt he did a wonderful job with A DREAM COME TRUE.  It was a well-paced story with a great, unpredictable ending.  The characters were interesting, the plot lines were managed very well, and the book had just enough drama to get the reader emotionally involved in the storyline.  In my opinion this book is very good, and I would urge all young men and want-to-be rappers to read it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ashanti<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31
The freak in you comes out at night...	They say the freak in you comes out at night and for Rena Robbins in SWINGERS, this could not be closer to the truth. For most of her life, she has yearned to be with another woman and it began long before her husband Greg stepped into her life.  Greg has been cheating for most, if not all, of their marriage, but when Rena receives a phone call from one of the women he has been sleeping with, she takes a stand.  Though hurt from discovering that Greg is in fact cheating, Rena seizes the opportunity to make her hidden desires come true and she goes all out.  She invites her husband to seek help from a marriage counselor for what she claims will repair their marriage.  The counselor suggests they admire women together.<br /><br />Never in his wildest dreams does Greg imagine the ultimate game being played on him.  Rena is secretly excited because she will have the opportunity to do what she's always desired.  So she gets on the Internet and starts her search to find a female she finds attractive.  Since her willing husband thinks he has a license to cheat, he agrees with her plan and sits back to take the ride. However, in searching for this female, Rena enters into a new place she had not considered and the lifestyle of swinging.<br /><br />In SWINGERS, Torrian Ferguson has given us a peek into a lifestyle that many people have embraced as a way to spice up their sex life.  Even though Rena set out to get her desires met, she really discovers more about her husband and herself in the process.  I like the way this story unfolds and gives the reader some voyeuristic peeks which allow him or her to engage their personal thoughts on the subject of swinging.  A definite page-turner, SWINGERS will keep you entertained until the very end.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nina Lewis<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

An interesting Journey	If you're looking for a financial guide that will help pave your way to financial abundance, then HOW TO ALMOST MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS may not be for you. If you're looking for a cute, antidotal account of one person's life journey, then don't hesitate to pick up a copy of Robert Leeds' most recent book.<br /><br />This book is more of a motivational guide to maintaining a positive disposition. It is laced with insightful messages, which Leeds refers to as proverbs. One particular proverb that caught my attention was, \\"Enthusiasm is the engine to success. Youth is the hole in the gas tank.\\" My personal interpretation gleamed from the author's story following the proverb is that we learn from our youthful mistakes.<br /><br />HOW TO ALMOST MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS is a different type of read that provides humorous wit relating to the author's personal experiences. It conveys an air of bold energy that cannot be denied.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31
Created for eternity	CREATED TO BE GOD'S FRIEND is an exploration into the life of Abraham.  By developing an intimate relationship with God, similar to that of Abraham, we come to a dimension of understanding, by faith.  Children of God must totally release their lives to Him to allow inexpressible joy and peace to prevail.  Blackaby points out that Abraham is the man God refers to as his friend (James 1:23) and God used his awesome powers to shape Abraham's life not just for a time but for eternity.  By studying the lessons conveyed in CREATED TO BE GOD'S FRIEND, it was Blackaby's intent that the reader would see Abraham's life from God's perspective as well as Abraham's response to God.  Then analyze how these lessons are manifested in our daily lives and help us to see our purpose.<br /><br />CREATED TO BE GOD'S FRIEND is not a book to be taken lightly.  It's lessons are comprehensive and provide further insight into the reader's personal relationship with God.  Each of the thirteen lessons can also be used on a stand-alone basis for personal or group study.  Mr. Blackaby's use of clear language, relevant examples and summary questions at the end of each chapter makes CREATED TO BE GOD'S FRIEND a study tool that I found to be very valuable.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

Do they really deserve all that?	Portland detectives, Ray Barkley and Nina Parker, are faced with a serial murderer that is going against all odds. This killer is wiping out men who have abused and beaten their wives or girlfriends, yet have gotten no punishment in the judicial system. Four men have been brutally slain with baseball bats and the count is rising. The killer beats them until they are unrecognizable. Not only is this criminal smart, the person appears to be a woman, which is a bit outside the profile for serial killers. To further complicate issues, Ray and Nina had an affair in the past and Nina becomes just a touch jealous when Ray falls hard for the judge involved in the case. Meanwhile, the judge's former lover, a defense lawyer who appears frequently in her court, has married and wants the judge to counsel his wife Vivien, on whether or not to have an abortion. The judge, Carole Cranston, is not sure whether to trust the friendliness of the wife or not. Maybe Vivien is the murderer; however, Nina is sure the judge is the guilty party.<br /><br />R. Barri Flowers has created a superb mystery. Every time you think you know who did it, another monkey wrench is tossed into the mix. Some characters seem so guilty but then you find yourself praying that they didn't do it because although they have good reasons for killing, it would just break your heart. There's just enough romance and romantic triangles to keep the interest going. It's a great book that any mystery lover will adore.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Street Fiction That Is True Hardcore!!!!	DUTCH II: Angel's Revenge is street fiction at its finest.  It is gritty, raw and hardcore, and at times downright disturbing.  It is the second installment by Ms. Woods that revolves around the life and times of the infamous drug pin, Bernard \\"Dutch\\"  Murphy.  The story begins with Dutch's trial and his going out, in a haze of gunfire.  We don't know if Dutch is alive or dead, but we do know that Queen Latifah's character Cleo, from the movie \\"Set It Off\\" doesn't have jack on Dutch.  His two lieutenants, Angel and One-eyed Roc, who are now serving life terms in prison, are expected to keep the legacy alive.<br /><br />However, while in prison One-eyed Roc, now known as Rahman, has experienced a conversion to Islam and wants no part of his former underworld dealings. He has a religious agenda to clean up his community, which includes a holy war with all criminal elements in the community.  This will place him into direct conflict with his former friend, Angel.<br /><br />Angel, who is now being released from prison on a legal technicality, has her own plans that are not as worthy as One-eyed Roc.  These plans include continuing Dutch's legacy of violence, drug-selling and just being a menace to society in general, aided and abetted by her girlfriend.  Angel is setting out to turn things upside-down.<br /><br />I am going to be honest.  I did not particularly like Dutch, the first book in the trilogy, because I thought it was a bad knock off version of the movie \\"New Jack City.\\"  The book was slow and repetitive of other books that were out at the time, and I was a little disappointed that Ms. Woods ventured so far from True To The Game, her first book.  I was a big Quadir and Gena fan back in the day and Dutch was so darn heartless. However, I truly enjoyed Dutch II. The pace was faster, the characters interconnected with more ease and the message was clearer.  The characters One-eyed Roc and Angel battle with a realm of emotions and conflict, two strong-willed individuals who both are determined to enforce their own private agendas by any means. Ms. Woods did a fine job of  examining the scope of friendship.  DUTCH II:  Angel's Revenge is suspenseful and dramatic.

An Explosive Dose Of Street Fiction:	AROUND THE WAY GIRLS 2 is the second grand slam production in the Urban Books street compilation of The Around The Way Girls series. The company's motto is \\"Where Drama Meets the Streets\\" and this book is a  fine example of explosive, dramatic stories with a sharply defined street edge. All of the contributing authors have laid their individual marks on the field of urban fiction.<br /><br />Kashamba Williams is a hardcore writer who pulls no punches when writing a story. Her books  Blinded, Grimey and Driven are examples of how she delivers a story with roughness and grit that is notable in urban fiction. \\"The Life of Juicy Brown\\" is the story of a 30 year old mother of five. Juicy is dysfunctional to say it mildly. She had all five of her children before the age of 18 and she openly puts her eldest son on the block to sell drugs.<br /><br />\\"Diamond n da Rough\\" written by Thomas Long is the story of Precious Paine, the daughter of  crack-addicted parents.  Precious' rough childhood has made her weary of the world. Her philosophy of life is scheming, stealing and plotting against men for their dough. Joined by her two best friends and her mother's crack-addicted friend,  Juicy forms a racket of stealing high-end merchandise from designer stores. This business endeavor has Precious on top financially,  but something is missing until Talib walks into her life to give a rude awakening.<br /><br />\\"The final story, Who Got Game?\\" by LaJill Hunt, is the story of Lyric Crenshaw, another \\"around the way girl\\", who is hell-bent on being on top of her game. Lyric's motto is to use what you got to get what you want and she has stood by that creed since high school. However, when she meets Jeremiah, she begins to have second thoughts about her shiesty and scheming lifestyle.<br /><br />When I see the title Around The Way Girl it brings to mind the  rap classic by  L.L. Cool J.  Being a self-proclaimed around the way girl, myself, I really enjoyed this book.  The stories were entertaining and colorful, but each had its own unique style and flavor. The contributing writers had their own take on how it would be,  to be an around the way girl.  The stories were different and true to the theme; ranging from golddigging to dysfunctional parenting. Each story brought to life the drama, the comedy, and the reality of how it is to be that around the way girl just trying to survive in the neighborhood. \\"The Life of Juicy Brown\\" is the standout.  She was so incredibly different and unique that she just stands out from the rest.  One minute I wanted to kill her, and the next minute, I wanted to just sit back and watch her do her thing. I found myself laughing out loud at the dialogue Ms. Williams used when describing Juicy's life.  Juicy's wit and  her schemes are so off the chain, I had to lean back and shake my head.  Juicy, Precious and Lyric were all different and appealing and each represented LL's song to the fullest. Just like the lyrics of the song, each woman  wasn't scared, each did her thing, and each were independent, while remaining  oh so crazy cool.  Definitely  the girls were from around the way.<br /><br />Reviewed by Richell Winchester<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersstories were entertaining and colorful, but each had its own unique style and flavor.

Out of the darkness and into the light.	JOURNEY OF MY SOUL is a collection of poetry by Sharnetha Roberson that was<br /><br />written as a living testimony of her struggle with depression.  The poems<br /><br />are intimate and showcase Roberson's raw emotions about her illness.  They<br /><br />are often dark, sad and conjure images of hopelessness.  Roberson takes you<br /><br />on a rollercoaster ride of the feelings that she was unable to control while<br /><br />she battled her disease at its onset.  She expresses perfectly, the damage<br /><br />and turmoil that the illness causes.  In Depression You Took My Life,<br /><br />Roberson shares her anger at depression and reveals how she feels like a<br /><br />victim.<br /><br />Reading JOURNEY OF MY SOUL is like peeking into Roberson's diary and feeling<br /><br />her pain and struggle toward recovery from a psychiatric disorder.  The<br /><br />collection is divided into sections with the beginning displaying her pain<br /><br />and hopelessness and the end showcasing her desire to overcome the disease<br /><br />through faith and trust in God.  JOURNEY OF MY SOUL gives you an inside look<br /><br />at the ravishing effects of depression, but is laced with hope of recovery<br /><br />with prayer, faith and perseverance.  The rawness of the emotion makes this<br /><br />collection compelling.  Stylistically, Roberson's technique is basic thus<br /><br />she utilizes little imagery, metaphor, or any other tools that more<br /><br />experienced poets might employ to illustrate their points.  That aside, her<br /><br />life experience is poetic and this collection bears witness to her struggles<br /><br />and triumphs.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31
A Mighty Noise	To say this poet has an exquisite compilation of works does the works no justice.  I will say this, which I extract from her dedications page.  \\"Kimya kingi kina mshindo mkubwa.\\"  Translated from Swahili, this means: A long silence followed by the mighty noise.  Like the end of a glorious theatre production, the audience is left silent and then, instantly and without warning, are brought to their feet in a thunderous applause, giving credence to a great work of art.<br /><br />Mikaylah Simone has created a book of poetry that spans every area of life.  We are drawn in during the first chapter, Spit'n Politics, with a powerful short piece, \\"Consciousness,\\" which speaks of integrity and justice.  She moves us then to Inner Voices, with pieces such as \\"One True Voice\\" and \\"Flatline,\\" works that dig deep into the human psyche, laying bare our heartfelt desire to have a voice in a world that would work to quell our views; and opening our mind to the reality of our mortality.<br /><br />Some Call it Love gives us a down-to-earth, sister-lemme-tell-ya view of love, with works such as \\"Cupid,\\" which spits resentment of an age-old love god who, without permission, shoots \\"unsuspecting people in the ass.\\"  And the remedy for keeping this deceptive love god at bay is something you would never imagine.<br /><br />Simone keeps us glued to our chairs when she moves on to For the Sake of Religion, a riveting look at secular religion and the damaging effects of creating a god for a people who have been yanked out of their culture and thrust into a state of destitution.  She fearlessly calls out priests on their penchant for nuns and little boys, while they lay warmly ensconced in their fine robes, concealing their false prophecies.

An Urban Street Tale	THE BADNESS is a modern-day urban legend that reads like street fiction.  In the tradition of urban legends, Nane Quartey's story is haunting and poignant.  It is the tale of four very unique individuals lost in the tough, gritty world of the inner city projects, whose lives connect in a hideous turn of events that will place each participant on the same dangerous path of destruction.<br /><br />Alias is haunted by a family curse.  He carries a terrible burden that torments his dreams and drives his days.  Doin and Joozy are two soul mates who share mutual physical imperfections.  Their unexpected love binds them together and seals their fate. After experiencing a traumatic abused childhood at the hands of his mother, D. Wayne is a sadistic tormented serial killer.  He is on a murderous spree, in search of fulfilling the insane demands of his imaginary god, Rah.<br /><br />Gripping and suspenseful, THE BADNESS played with my emotions from start to finish.  It wasn't an ordinary tale of life in the streets, instead all of the characters were developed and distinct.  This story has a lethal dose of hard-edged street life. The plot, the characters, and the setting, were utterly unique and fascinating.  The words and characters just jumped off the pages.  While reading this story, I was in the mind of each character.  I felt every emotion. When Joozy and Doin fell in love, I fell in love!  When Alias was fighting his nightmares, I was having nightmares!  The abuse and pain D. Wayne endured, I endured it!<br /><br />Quartay crafted a fine-tuned detailed story with love, angst, pain, and humor.  THE BADNESS is a suspense thriller that captures the lives of four very different lost souls, traveling on a haunted and tormented journey through life.  However, when fate steps in and places each on the same path, the results are the makings of a \\"true urban legend.\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by Richell Winchester<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31
Picture Perfect	In Francine Craft's latest installment of the Steele family saga, readers are introduced to Caitlin Coster.  Caitlin is the proprietor of an art gallery located in Washington, D.C.  Having endured the loss of her twin brother, husband and infant son, Caitlin doesn't know how she could have survived had it not been for her special friend and colleague, renowned artist Marty Steele.<br /><br />Marty has been in love with Caitlin for years, but has never made his intentions known.  When Marty decides to visit for an extended period of time, his first order of business is to persuade Caitlin to give them a chance.  After discovering some priceless paintings missing from her gallery, Caitlin finds herself in danger.  Will Marty come to her rescue or is it too late?<br /><br />Francine Craft has penned a very suspenseful tale.  The novel is well-written with an intriguing storyline that paves the way to a very romantic climax.  DREAMS OF ECSTASY is chocked full of murder, lies and deceit; readers will not want to see it end.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching each and every brush stroke fill the blank canvas of Caitlin and Marty's life to reveal a masterpiece of finding true love and happiness.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
(RAW Rating: 3.5) - A Whole New Perspective	Have you ever wondered why you like the things you like or even what career would best be suited for you?  Have you ever daydreamed about Mr. Right or what makes you really you?  Well, look no futher!  DAUGHTERS OF THE KING suggests the ideal types of careers, spouses, clothing and loads of other things! We've all seen or heard about personality analysis before, whether it was Meyers-Briggs or some other method.  Yet, Dr. Gail M. Hayes provides a whole new perspective in her book DAUGHTERS OF THE KING, which opens by providing an analytical quiz to the reader to help determine which of the six types they may fall into, from Jaunty Espirit to Sensual Exotic. For instance, if you fall in the \\"Harmonic Refined\\" category, you may see yourself as some type of diplomat affecting world peace or how about an accountant keeping the numbers in order?  With your distinctive traits, you like to plan your work and work your plan.  You have a great eye for detail.  Just like the prophetess Anna, people have great respect for you and how you get things done but their feathers may get ruffled by your directness.  Whereas your \\"Elegant Flamboyant\\" sister is a woman in charge and she has no problem letting others know it.  She is the free-spirit entrepreneur who loves marching to the beat of her own drummer, just like her Biblical counterpart Lydia.  She could also be that talk show host who likes to be the center of everyone's spot.  Although these are just two of the personality traits highlighted in the book, Dr. Hayes relates each of the six traits back to a Biblical female and thoroughly provides insight ranging from clothing and jewelry preferences to career choices and family relations.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the approach DAUGHTERS OF THE KING provided.  It was an interesting glimpse into a subject matter that I've studied in the past.  While I enjoyed the biblical references, I thought some of the generalizations about the various image types may have been just that, too general.  Yet, I found myself studying the text in the book and at times, laughing out loud or shaking my head in agreement.  If you're curious to see how your personality style matches up to your biblical counterpart, do not pass up DAUGHTERS OF THE KING.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthat, too general.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - Is It Really Real?	WHAT'S REAL is Daaimah S. Poole's story of three unlikely girlfriends trying to escape their everyday Philadelphia lives-even if it's just for the weekend.  The title of this book would lead the reader to believe that the friendship between these three women is what they discover is \\"real\\" in their lives, but that's not what happens.  What starts out as a relational book about three friends morphs into a selfish grab for what is important to each of them individually.<br /><br />While on a weekend trip to Miami for some fun and sun, the women end up thrashing their own individual paths through the Miami nightlife.  Janelle, an overworked and underpaid assistant manager at a retail clothing store, abandons the crew for a date with a rap superstar and ends up meeting a man who has the ability to take her away from the hardship and deprivation, both financial and emotional, that she has been struggling with.  The problem is he has to overcome his own issues first, and Janelle has made some major life decisions before she figures this out.<br /><br />Natalie, a young mother with questionable career goals, spends most of the weekend longing for her husband and baby whom she has ditched in an effort to teach her husband not to take her for granted.  The result, however, is not what she expected and changes her and her son's life forever.<br /><br />Tanya is the quintessential gold-digger hustler skank who will pimp her body to the right man for the right price without hesitation.  Although she usually comes out on top, she faces a few challenges on this trip that leave her taking a hard look at her life.  And when she returns home to find that the crack-addicted mother who abandoned her has returned and is displacing her from her grandmother's home, she releases emotional demons that have haunted her for as long as she can remember.<br /><br />This novel has the potential to be a really good story.  The problem is that every time the author hits an uncomfortable moment, she glides right past it.  Natalie's story is more intense than the other two.  Ms. Poole should have ridden that intensity through the other women's stories and not merely grazed over the issues of drug addiction, poverty, and family that the other two had to deal with.  There are also point-of-view problems with this story.  Each character relates her own story, but frequently the stories overlap and the reader must cover the same ground about one character while another character is telling her story.  I have to say I was disappointed in this novel, but hope to see Ms. Poole dig a little deeper in her next effort.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersoment, she glides right past it.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - What Goes Around Comes Around	MRS. RAFTON, REAPING AND SOWING by Lola C. Hardaway is the story of an elderly woman who becomes lost in the system of state-assisted nursing care.  The subject matter of this book was certainly unique as there are very few books that address the subject of elder abuse.  It was enlightening as it showcased many areas in which nursing homes can take advantage of the system and provided information with which we should all have some acquaintance.<br /><br />Mona Lockard, a feisty, double amputee octogenarian, carries her faith before her like a banner and shares that faith with everyone she encounters.  Mona suffers a stroke, loses her memory, and becomes separated from her only living relative.  Mona's niece, Melody Kyles, returns home following a failed marriage to find Mona missing.  With the aid of an old friend, she locates her aunt, and then sets about taking down the greedy Sara Rafton who has spent years preying on the elderly as the owner and administrator of a roach-infested nursing home.  Melody's adventures lead to romance, but, more importantly, she experiences a dramatic growth in her faith and allows it to guide her life.<br /><br />MRS. RAFTON is a well-written book full of the author's knowledge of the elder care industry and graphic descriptions of abuse -- mental, physical, and economic.  Although it is not marketed as Christian fiction, it certainly falls within that category; devotees of this genre will enjoy this book.  Although lacking in suspense and for the most part predictable, the ending has a bite that will leave readers feeling sympathy even for the villainous Mrs. Rafton.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
Life in the Fast Lane	Caught at the crossroads of all that is good and all that feels good, Solomon Woods is an accident waiting to happen.  On one hand, he is the responsible single father trying to set the example for his teenaged son, Isiah.  He has a promising career as an automotive design engineer and he is an all-around nice guy, yet he spirals down into a dark world.  The lure of drugs and fast money attracts Solomon like a fly to fly paper.  The whole time, his conscience is talking to him, so he takes on this Robin Hood mentality of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, but at what costs?  Will he be able to keep all of his balls in the air as he juggles right versus wrong?<br /><br />All in all, this was an fast-paced novel.  However, its characters lacked depth and could have been developed to have been more robust.  Some of the scenes contained people that were conveniently placed, yet these scenes and the characters in them could have been further developed to add more texture to the overall story.  The first person narrative provided an easy flow to the novel and it held my attention.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
(RAW Rating: 3.5) - Coming of Age	Adults, particularly parents, are at times so engrossed in finances, failed relationships, job stress, and so many other issues that they often forget that children have problems too.  In Keisha Bell's first novel, EMERGING FREE..., she examines the impact of parent's choices on the lives of their children.  Free, the main character, is a model teen; she gets good grades, is active in her church, and has a plan for her future which includes earning a scholarship to pay for college.  But when her mother decides to move the family so that she can be close to Tony, an ex-beau who is gravely ill, Free's world is literally turned upside down.  As the book opens, Free decides that running away is her As the story unfolds, Free meets Siarra, a classmate with problems of her own, and the two girls form a special friendship.  Siarra is trying to adjust to only option.<br /><br />her parents' recent divorce and is dealing with feelings of anger and abandonment toward her father.  The two girls are more than friends; but also kindred spirits, they both have their own pain, but learn to rely on one another for support, advice, and at times, simply a listening ear.  In addition to their respective family issues, the girls also deal with the day to day \\"stuff\\" that teens encounter, such as relationships with boys, academic pressures, and peer pressure.<br /><br />This is a book that young adult readers, particularly girls, will read and enjoy.  While there were times I felt the main characters were a bit melodramatic, I felt it was an accurate portrayal of young girls at that stage of life.  I would not consider EMERGING FREE... christian fiction, but rather a book featuring Christian characters.  Free and her family regularly attend church and many of her prayers are included in the story.  Realistic characters and a compelling plot make this a book a good bet for young readers.  The ending left me wanting more, but Bell's second novel will continue with the story of the lives of Free, Siarra and her friends.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersives of Free, Siarra and her friends. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
When we practice to deceive....	If you are a Brenda Jackson fan such as myself, you're more than likely patiently waiting for Chase Westmoreland's story--well, you will just have to wait.<br /><br />In her latest addition to the Westmoreland series, Ms. Jackson introduces us to Dana Rollins.  Her fianc&eacute;, Luther Cord, reneged on their engagement and now he wants the ring back.  He has hired the gorgeous high-powered attorney Jared Westmoreland to represent him.  Doing what any lawyer is paid to do, Jared convinces Dana that it would be in her best interest if she complies with his client's wishes.  Feeling she has made the right decision by giving the ring back, Dana extends Jared an invitation to one day return the favor.<br /><br />Being the eldest child, Jared's mother expects him to set an example for his other siblings by bringing a guest to his father's and uncle's birthday party.  Knowing full well he doesn't have a steady girlfriend, Jared is at a loss on what to do.  He runs into Dana and asks her to accompany him to the party.  Since she owes him a favor anyway, she says yes.  While at the party his eavesdropping mother overhears the word engagement, so naturally she believes that Jared and Dana are engaged.  When Jared stops by his parents' house to inform them of the misunderstanding, his father shares with him some devastating news regarding his mother's health.  Not wanting to see his mother unhappy, Jared asks Dana if she would just pretend to be his fianc&eacute;e, but makes it perfectly clear that she would be expected to perform as his fianc&eacute;e, in every sense of the word.  The problem Dana faces is enduring Jared's heated kisses and his many other tantalizing advances.<br /><br />In true fashion, Ms. Jackson has written a very delightful romance filled story.  The novel is well-written with a wonderful storyline, and the well-developed plot makes JARED'S COUNTERFEIT FIANC&Eacute;E a splendid read.

After the death of his abusive, alcoholic father, Abel Crofton leaves Harlem, New York in search of a mother he has never known.  His search starts in Amsterdam, the city of his birth, but ends in the tiny Dutch village of Haarlem in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Abel has both loved and hated the shadowy figure of his mother.  Not having any knowledge of her has haunted his childhood.  The abuse by his father, the pain of maternal abandonment, and the total lack of love in his life after the death of his grandmother eventually drives him to alcoholism and other self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />After his recovery, Abel isolates himself from society by climbing deep into the tunnels of New York where he drags cable for the electric company.  Although he has mastered his addiction and been sober for more than a decade, he struggles daily with his \\"Thirst,\\" as he refers to it.  He thinks that by ignoring his past, he can simply forget it, which is contrary to everything he was taught in his twelve-step program.  Owning his past abusive behavior to the people around him is the one issue he and his best friend/sponsor, Serge, cannot reconcile and keeps him from advancing his recovery.<br /><br />After his father's death, Abel discovers a lead to his mother's whereabouts and heads to Amsterdam.  While there, he meets Sophie, also a recovering addict.  She is an African/Surinamese woman struggling to stay in recovery and trying to help her drug-addicted sister get there as well.  It isn't until Abel meets Sophie that he discovers the value in claiming his past and finds the strength to help others seeking recovery.  Sophie also aids Abel in the quest to locate his mother.  With her assistance, he discovers that there is much more for him in Amsterdam than he ever suspected - redemption, love and family.<br /><br />HAARLEM by Heather Neff is the story of a man in search of his family.  Neff draws a deft portrait of Abel as he maneuvers through a foreign environment and uses the theme of jazz to metaphorically describe scenes, feelings, and places, comparing them to various musical masterpieces.

Fresh out of law school, he enjoys talking to his neighbor, Mrs. Petroff, who believes that if he eats her beef stroganoff every Friday night, he'll find someone to have a meaningful relationship with.  That is, until he pairs up with Steven Cox, an arrogant, no-good lawyer with a penchant for showing off.  After 2 years, the case that Jason's been working on hits pay-dirt.  Problem is, he's looking for love the wrong way and gets influenced by Steven, who's not only jealous, but intends to help him spend the four-million dollar bonus he received from winning his case.<br /><br />Carole Brantford works at a non-profit agency.  Her sole intent is to help others, but she just can't seem to help herself.  In and out of relationships, she feels like she'll never find \\"the one.\\"  Finally, with advice from her good friend Marcia and the help of a magazine, she begins to realize that in love, there are no set \\"rules\\" and you have to play your cards to win, but with the right person.<br /><br />These two never anticipated running into each other again; there are still scars from their college days.  Carole hasn't gotten over what happened in their relationship and still holds a bitter grudge against Jason.  Although they have a close, mutual friend in common, he just wants to stay out of her way.  Will they ever put aside their difference to really come to know and understand what's important in life?<br /><br />FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS was an easy, light-hearted read.  From beginning to end, I found myself laughing and thinking about situations where I could recall reading a magazine and trying to follow the advice, realizing that it was very misguided.  Lawrence Ross does an excellent job of showing how you can be easily influenced when you want to fit in, and the beauty of being exactly who you are.

(RAW Rating: 2.5) - Picture Perfect	Life was excelling for international business owner Keino Mazrui. As the eldest son of wealthy African parents, he had more than his fair share of responsibilities. Obligations to his culture, family, business, and pending marriage, left Keino's life complicated and occasionally stressful. However, after meeting and being immediately smitten by the lovely Amara Terrell, his life gets even more problematic as his desire for her directly affects most of his other obligations.<br /><br />Amara was also living a life just as satisfying as Keino's with just one thing missing: deep, gratifying, romantic love. She had a wonderful family, a prospering business, a beautiful home, and great friends.  Reared with deep family values and self-respect, she refused to carelessly give herself to any man and chose, instead, to wait until everything felt perfect. She definitely meets her match when she lays eyes on the powerful Keino Mazrui and begins a picture perfect, cross-cultural affair that neither one of them would forget.<br /><br />Graced with sweet romance and tastefully created sexual episodes, A FOREIGN AFFAIR by Chilufiya Safaa gives readers that charming, idealistic story often absent from contemporary romance. Everything is perfect; opulence radiates in everything that the Mazrui's and the Terrell's do and have. However, problems were solved so effortlessly that the conflict needed to drive the plot and hook me as a reader wasn't there. The novel is overly predictable with static, impersonal conversations, and the characters are flat and two dimensional. The constantly shifting perspectives (among all characters, even those who do not play a major part in the plot) only aid in showing readers what other characters are thinking instead of adding depth to those characters' personalities. The settings are described well and the African customs and traditions are an added bonus; in spite of this, I felt no connection with the main characters or their deep, overpowering love for each other.<br /><br />For me, the best feature of this novel is the international setting. The insight into another culture truly held my attention. Even though everything is all too perfect in A FOREIGN AFFAIR, that isn't always a bad thing, especially if you are looking for a read that will take your mind off the universality of drama-filled love between the less fortunate.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersng love for each other.  <br /> <br />For me, the best feature of this novel is the international setting.

She started out life as a foundling, left in a shoebox in the alley behind Vittorio's Italian restaurant.  Due to the intervention of the Blessed Virgin, according to her rescuer, she is discovered before becoming food for the rats and subsequently adopted.  Unfortunately, she never establishes familial ties with her adopted family and, as an adult, struggles to make a place for herself in the world that feels like home.<br /><br />Rebecca's life is changed for the better when she meets and moves in with Joe.  Not her lover, but definitely loved, he changes her life for the good.  He even introduces her to her future husband, Adam.  Rebecca lives a blissful existence with Joe and Adam and eventually gives birth to beautiful, red-haired, Ruby.  For the first time in her life, Rebecca is connected to someone by blood, and she finally begins to feel that she is not alone in the world.<br /><br />Fate, however, has other plans for Rebecca.  Ruby dies.  Rebecca and Adam are both lost in grief and end up losing each other.  They slog through their days trying to stifle their grief, Adam as a neonatologist, seeking ways he could have saved Ruby in every premature baby he treats, and Rebecca as the steadfast assistant of a wealthy hotelier, Mr. Damiano.  Her beneficent boss sees Rebecca's grief and finds a way to help her re-invent her life's story.<br /><br />Joe, devastated for his friends and trying to deal with the angst of growing up without his own father, makes a tremendous sacrifice for Rebecca by turning away from his all-consuming historical research and crafting a novel set in World War I of two lovers who might have been Rebecca's mother and his father, binding them as siblings as surely as if they had been born that way.<br /><br />Fiercely emotional, hauntingly sad, and yet joyful in the end, MOURNING RUBY is a story of loss and redemption, grief and grace.

A Whole New World	THE BARON SON: Vade Mecum 7 is just what it purports to be-a useful reference book or guide that one would want to keep nearby.  Whether the reader is a CEO, salesperson, inventor, merchant, or civic leader, this book addresses major concerns in today's business and social arenas.<br /><br />The authors, Vicky Therese Davis, William R. Patterson, and D. Marques Patton, all entrepreneurs and executives in their own right, use their diverse, collective knowledge and experience to share standard tenets of wealth-building and leadership that readers who dislike the self-help/motivational genre's lackluster style might really enjoy.  THE BARON SON is the allegorical, biographic tale of the main character, the Baron.  The Baron takes on three students who come to him seeking his advice on improving their position in life.  He shows them exactly how to accomplish their goals by using his own life as an example.  He teaches them eleven supreme principles that are universally applicable in business matters, civic groups, or religious organizations.<br /><br />THE BARON SON is an excellent exploration into the new world of ethical leadership and wealth-building strategies in the post-Enron business environment.  It focuses on success strategies that hinge on the betterment of all involved.  The archaic use of language, which felt like a convoluted cross between Shakespearean Old English and a bad Sun Tzu translation, was a little distracting at times, but if you're entertained by the fantasy fiction genre, it's probably not a problem.  The other shortfall was the lack of female characters in positions of power.  This is a rather glaring oversight that should have been addressed, considering the prominent place of women in today's business world.  The authors have indicated, however, that their next offering will be entitled The Baroness.  Hopefully, it will pick up where THE BARON SON left off and incorporate women into this man's world.  The book in total, however, provides very good guidance in an entertaining fashion for the reader looking to get ahead in life and business.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersdes very good guidance in an entertaining fashion for the reader looking to get ahead in life and business. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26

One frustrating day, the young boy falls asleep under a tree feeling dejected and with little hope.  He is awakened by a big blue bird, who explains that he has come because the boy called him using the language of his heart.  He goes on to explain that if the boy wants his greatest wish, to tell his parents he loves them, to come true, all he has to do is tell them using his heart.  As the boy returns to the house, he remembers what the bird told him and once again tries to convey to his parents all the words trapped inside of him with hopes of finally being heard.<br /><br />This touching story is written in a style reminiscent of a proverb or fairy tale.  The warm, calming illustrations drew me into the story and were the perfect complement to Yamanaka's writing style.  The content of the book was inspired by the author and her husband's experiences as parents of a child with autism, yet its message is universal.  While the story focused a lot on the boy's inability to communicate in the beginning of the book, it is just as much about using the heart's language to communicate as it is having a heart that is open enough to hear what is being said.  THE HEART'S LANGUAGE is a wonderful story about unconditional love and listening with more than your ears.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26

(RAW Rating: 3.5) -  Written from the Heart	DEAR DIARY...LETTERS FROM LANA is a book that exposes the very heart of a child with an unimaginably difficult life.  Told through a series of diary entries, readers learn firsthand what Lana is thinking and feeling.<br /><br />As the book begins, Lana is living with her mother in utter misery.  Her mother's boyfriend, who also lives in the home, makes regular visits to her bedroom at night where she is victimized by him.  While the pain of the abuse is bad enough, she is particularly hurt by the sense of betrayal she feels towards her mother, who pretends nothing is going on.  At school, Lana is a loner.  Without the money to buy stylish clothes, the confidence to believe in her own value, and the weight of her personal issues bearing down, she pretty much goes to classes and is unnoticed by her peers.  As the story evolves, things escalate and Lana finds herself even more alone, fending for herself.  As Lana's life continues to spiral downward, she becomes an easy target for predators.  This in turn causes her life to spin even further out of control.  The surprising light in her life is the unexpected friendship she develops with Chris, a popular student from a wealthy background.  But will her relationship with Chris be enough to save her from all the darkness in her life?<br /><br />Audra Woodard has written a deeply moving tale that shows how abuse, abandonment, substance abuse and a myriad of other issues can impact the life of a child.  Lana's words were poignant; as I read, I was moved by the raw emotion.  I couldn't help but empathize with her character, even when I didn't agree with her behavior.  In spite of the diary entry format, the characters were carefully thought-out and the plot was generally well executed.  There were moments where I felt the story stalled a bit and other aspects were a bit rushed, but neither of these issues took away from the story in a major way.  Tragic, yet in some ways triumphant, DEAR DIARY...LETTERS FROM LANA lingered in my heart and mind long after I had finished the last page.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersred in my heart and mind long after I had finished the last page. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26

(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Fitting In	THE UNWANTED CHILD is a collection of poetry in which author Camille K. L. Anthony expresses some of the experiences and emotions she dealt with while growing up.  She is a young author, who aspires to one day attend college, but the wisdom reflected in her poetry exemplifies a maturity that surpasses her age.  She writes about her insecurities and the emotional difficulties she encountered after learning that she was adopted.  Her poetry expresses her feelings with such heartfelt intensity that it immediately summoned my full attention.  In addition, she writes about God, family, death, suicide, young love and many other topics all from her teen perspective.<br /><br />Some of my favorite poems included \\"I'm Tired of Waking Up in the Morning,\\" a poem in which she discusses several sources of frustration, ranging from the thug image to President Bush's policy's with regards to Iraq.  This poem was socially relevant, current, and is sure to encourage young adult readers to be more aware of the world around them.  In \\"Taken-For-Granted Friend,\\" Camille writes about the hurt and betrayal she feels as the result of being mistreated by a friend she has known most of her life and in \\"Inner & Outer Beauty\\" she talks about her issues with self-image.  Young love is explored in poems like \\"Waiting for Your Call,\\" \\"Poem of Apology\\" and \\"Mixed Feelings.\\"  And \\"Unwanted Child Part I,\\" \\"Mysterious Mother,\\" and \\"Lil' Cuz'\\" were among my favorite poems dealing with family.<br /><br />Camille K.L. Anthony has openly shared her innermost thoughts and wisdom through her poetry, and in doing so, gives voice to an experience many young adults face.  Her poetry took me back in time and reminded me of the thoughts and feelings I had as an adolescent and young adult.  I am confident that teen readers, especially girls, will enjoy this book tremendously and will find at least one or two poems they can relate to deeply.  In addition, the very publication of this collection of poetry can serve as a source of inspiration for other young aspiring authors.  I hope Camille continues to write; as she matures and learns more about the technical aspects of poetry, her writing is sure to evolve and reach even greater heights.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerscan serve as a source of inspiration for other young aspiring authors.

Literary Treat	Set mostly in 1948 England, with flashbacks taking place both there and in Jamaica, SMALL ISLAND by Andrea Levy is a complex story told through the voices of four main characters, two black and two white.  Hortense is a young Jamaican girl, who has lived on the island rather comfortably because of her father's status.  She is well-educated and aspires to be a teacher in one of the island's prominent schools.  She dreams of the glitz and glamour of life in England, and when she meets Gilbert and he offers her a chance to move there along with his hand in marriage, she jumps at the chance.  However, from the moment she steps off the ship she knows that life in England will be far different than she imagined.  When Gilbert had the opportunity to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), he thought he finally had a chance to take the world (and all the women he could handle) by storm.  But his encounters with racism both during and after his tenure with the RAF soon leave him disheartened.  After sending for Hortense, he and his new wife set up house in a small room they rent and begin trying to build a life together.<br /><br />Queenie, named after Queen Victoria herself, always dreamed of having a great life but her married life is not quite how she had anticipated.  When her husband Bernard joins the RAF but doesn't return, she has to make it on her own and begins renting rooms in her home.  She is socially ostracized when she decides to allow blacks to rent rooms in her home.  Things seem to be going well for her, until her husband suddenly returns and shakes things up around the house.  Finally, Bernard is a middle-aged banker with little meaning or purpose in his life.  He decides to join the RAF in an effort to avoid being drafted into the infantry.  Surprisingly, he finds that he enjoys being part of a team and he has even more pep in his step.  When it is time to return home however, he decides to take a scenic route, and doesn't return to his wife until two years after he should have.<br /><br />SMALL ISLAND has created a lot of buzz and captured a few awards.  After reading the book, it is clear that it is Levy's writing which is literary, poetic, ironic, and lyrical, that is responsible for the positive response to the book.  Her character development was superb, and as I read I felt as if I was having an intimate conversation with the characters.  She fluidly transitions between past and present and between the voices of the various narrators, all the while, drawing you deeper into their respective stories and indeed, their lives.  The plot addresses issues of poverty, racism, classism, and other social issues as well as more personal ones such as the search for true happiness in life and in a marriage.

To Go Boldly Where You've Never Gone Before	The Reverend Dr. Susan Newman opens YOUR INNER EVE by asking \\"Have you felt there was another you - not a mini me but another expression of yourself - a part of yourself waiting for permission to speak?\\"  The Inner Eve is defined as the feminine expression of God's spirit residing in each of us.  Throughout life's journey, we may have lost touch with our Inner Eve because of societal issues, shifts in self-esteem, and faltering faith.  In order for us to sense the presence of the Holy Spirit around us and re-connect with our Inner Eve, we must allow our rational mind and our intuition to unite as one.  There are seven chapters, plus a resource guide, contained in this powerful book.  Each chapter addresses some aspect of the Inner Eve theory, such as proclaiming your power, walking in purpose, and being a goddess - just to name a few!  This is the book that will make you stop, pause and evaluate who you are, where you are, and where you want to go!<br /><br />From introduction, INNER EVE had me enthralled with its flowing messages.  In chapter one - Eve Where Are You?, we learn from the creation story to not speak to snakes.  No, we're probably not going to see the actual serpent that Eve saw slithering around and talking to her in the Garden, but snakes are people in our lives that will attempt to deceive us, upset our personal utopias and bring heartbreak to God.  This chapter coupled with the other chapters reminds us to be cognizant of our surroundings and to create our own joy by what we gather in our minds, spirits and surroundings.<br /><br />The messages contained in INNER EVE are written in a clear, conversational manner that sparks a new understanding.  The pearls of wisdom shared by Dr. Newman are insightful and offer great opportunities for self-reflection.  If you are a Christian woman seeking a closer relationship with God, I urge you to do some self-exploration with this great book!<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers<br />	2005-08-26
(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Life on the Edge	Ever hear the expression, \\"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up way too much space?\\"  Well, Stephen E. Chatman keeps his self-titled main character constantly hanging on for dear life.  Fortunately, Stephen is the most charming bi-polar psychopath around.  He is a retired prizefighter turned computer tech who finds himself constantly fighting guys who disrespect him.  His \\"fight-first-and-ask-questions-later\\" attitude lands him on probation and in the bad graces of a gang of porn-producing Russians.  He's also caught up in the mix with four influential women in his life: Liza, Max, Gigi and Rachel.  Three are former lovers with unique significance and one is the love of his life.  Although Stephen is a first-class ass, the reader can't help but cheer for him, even when it's clear he's about to screw himself again.<br /><br />COOKING BACON NAKED is filled with raw sarcasm, graphic wit, gritty portrayals, and habitual violence.  Stephen staggers through life in a merlot and drug induced haze as if he's not afraid of dying.  And why should he be?  His addiction and over-medication leave him feeling invincible and unaccountable for his actions.  The effect is hypnotic.  Chatman tells Stephen's story in the first person as if the character is sitting at the local watering hole swilling merlot and swapping lies.  Chatman had the courage and foresight to leave himself room to bring Stephen back in a sequel to tantalize readers with more of his dysfunctional logic and questionable judgment.  Undoubtedly, most readers would like a novel to end in a satisfying conclusion, but Stephen's life is just a little too complex to tie up in a predictable package.  A commercial ending would not have fit the characterization.  COOKING BACON NAKED is original, unapologetic, and crass; it will leave women rolling their eyes at the arrogance and men secretly wishing for a mental disorder as an excuse to act out.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
Is it Possible to Mate for Life?	SWIMMING WITH SWANS is one of those books that leave you caught in the middle as a writer/reviewer and as a reader.  The plot begins with a wedding between a demanding bride, Lori, and her groom, Wayne.  Wayne yearns for the stability of family life and being a father to his children, but does not relish the thought of having to sleep with the same woman for the rest of his life.  Their marriage quickly heads downhill when Lori turns out to be less than desirable as a homemaker and Wayne turns to the affections of another woman to satisfy his thirst for sexual diversity.<br /><br />Lori's sister, April, and her husband, Paul, appear to be the poster couple for domestic bliss.  Their lives seem perfect until April becomes chronically ill and secrets are revealed that threaten not only their marriage, but their lives.<br /><br />Leeanna and Frank are the young women's parents.  For almost forty years, they have held up the banner of the traditional roles between men and women.  Frank has supported his family, while Leeanna has played the part of the domestic diva, going to work only after her two children are old enough to fend for themselves.  But as they near retirement, the stress on Frank's job and Leanna's mounting impatience with his domineering ways escalate to the boiling point and has them examining the true meaning of lifetime commitment.<br /><br />To sum it up, there is good news and bad news about this novel.  The bad news is in the mechanics.  The book falls short in the areas of editing, dialogue, consistency of point of view, transitions, and the introduction of some unnecessary characters.  The good news is that it is actually an engaging story.  It has a beginning, middle, and an end.  The necessary characters are well-sketched, and their personalities and motivations are clear.  Carla Diane Ellis is not afraid to approach issues that most writers are hesitant to deal with effectively.  She touches on some uncomfortable moments with skill and takes the characters through some unexpected, and sometimes politically incorrect, twists that increase tension in the plot and make it original.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersakes the characters through some unexpected, and sometimes politically incorrect, twists that increase tension in the plot and make it original.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
(RAW Rating: 3.5) - A  storm is raging....	While preparing for the onslaught of Hurricane Lily, Jessi Andrews is enroute to her husband Derrick's car dealership.  She finds Derrick in a very unpleasant act with his assistant, and leaves without either of them knowing she's aware of their dirty little deed.  Although she is in the midst of a raging storm, it doesn't measure up to the one raging within her heart.<br /><br />Jessi, not wanting to face Derrick, drops their twin sons off at her mother's house and ends up at the home of Karen, one of her best friends.  Karen, who is white and married to a black man, drops everything to be by Jessi's side.  When Regina, the last of the trio, finds out about Derrick's indiscretions, Jessi and Karen fear the worst because of Regina's streetwise attitude.  Instead, she, along with Karen, encourage Jessi to do what she feels is in her best interest.<br /><br />Cassandra Darden Bell has written a very poignant novel involving three women who are the best of friends.  Jessi, Karen and Regina are as much alike as they are different.  Encased in the pages of this novel is one woman's plight of finding herself, while the weight of the world is on her shoulders.  Jessi is not only faced with issues of her own, but those of Karen, Regina and her mother.  The novel seems a little slow at times and then gains momentum.  All in all the characterization and the storyline makes AFTER THE STORM a wonderful read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
History Comes Alive	Throughout his writing career, Julius Lester has made numerous contributions to African American Children's Literature.  His latest book, DAY OF TEARS is no exception.  The book, presented in dialogue, is a fictional account of a real historical event, the largest slave auction in American history.  The auction took place after Pierce Butler, a wealthy plantation owner with a gambling problem, was forced to sell off over 400 slaves in order to pay his debts.  The auction took place on March 2nd and 3rd, 1859 in Georgia.<br /><br />The principal characters in the novel include slaves from the Butler plantation, as well as from one of the plantations some of the slaves were sold to, members of the Butler family, the auctioneer, and other businessmen.  As the story unfolds, the consequences of slavery, not only for the slaves, but also for their owners, become apparent.<br /><br />DAY OF TEARS looks at the history of slavery in the United States in a way that depicts the human casualties of the institution.  Whether it was the broken families and friendships that were destroyed when slaves were callously sold away like material possessions or the moral and spiritual consequences of being responsible for such sales, Lester captures it all.  He highlights the mentality of the slave-owner and vividly depicts the reasoning used to justify their acts and assuage their guilt.  He also shows the mindset of some of those who were enslaved and presents slaves who were seemingly satisfied in their position, as well as those who aspired for freedom.  Finally, through his characters he reminds readers that not all whites supported slavery and that some even helped facilitate their escape to freedom.<br /><br />The dialogue format of this book made the story come alive.  I would love to see this novel acted out in schools and youth groups as a teaching tool.  The book is sure to garner in-depth discussion about the history of slavery in this country.  DAY OF TEARS is a poignant tale that is full of emotion and a satisfying work of historical fiction that should be required reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersignant tale that is full of emotion and a satisfying work of historical fiction that should be required reading. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
Lost in Translation	WHAT THE SHADOW TOLD ME by Kurtis Davidson, the writing team of Kurt Jose Ayau and David Rachels, begins when Rufus Walter Eddison, America's greatest African-American writer, dies suddenly.  His editor, Justina Patterson, is left scrambling to find the manuscript to his second novel before an unscrupulous senior editor at her publishing company can generate a fake to be passed off as the work of the dead genius.  Justina has been brought up to revere the famed author, as has all of America and most of the world.  The only problem is he wrote his great American novel in 1951 and for forty-eight years has failed to deliver the manuscript of the sequel as he was under contract to do.  Eddison was so paranoid that his second novel wouldn't live up to the world's expectations that he never even wrote a grocery list after that.  Or so it seemed.  Justina has to find his book or face grim alternatives: seeing Eddison's elderly widow, the sweet Maisy May, impoverished because she has to pay back the large advance the publishing company paid Eddison years before or allowing her publisher to perpetrate a literary fraud in the name of book sales.<br /><br />In the effort to locate the lost manuscript, Justina meets a wide assortment of hilarious characters, which are well-developed and unique in their voices.  Among them is Biminim Strimpoonanamam, an Asian man with an unpronounceable name and nearly unintelligible English.  Biminim translates novels from English to another foreign language to English for people who speak English as a second language.  The result is outrageous translations of great literary works in Pidgin English that border on the racist, but land on the side of just plain funny.<br /><br />Ayau and Rachels as Kurtis Davidson have written a story that takes humorous stabs at the publishing industry, sports, music, the rural South, academia, and literature, in general.  Most of the characters in this story are African-American, but the theme is so universal in its appeal that it doesn't feel weird that two white guys wrote this novel.  WHAT THE SHADOW TOLD ME is clever and satirical.  It is the winner of the 2003 Faulkner Society of New Orleans Award.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerssal in its appeal that it doesn't feel weird that two white guys wrote this novel.

Evil Uncoiled	In MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH, Dr. Lesego Malepe takes us back in time to the beginning of the end of apartheid.  The Dutch and English colonized South Africa in the seventeenth century, but by 1963 the Boers had taken oppression to unbelievable heights of outrage.  Black South Africans were foreigners in their own land - required to carry passes at all times and jailed for disagreeing with a government in which they had no representation.<br /><br />The Maru family has been fortunate.  Although they live in a village haunted by the specter of Mamogashwa, a mythical monster that drowns black children in the river, their lives are better than many.  Edward is a professor at a university and his wife, Evelyn, is a teacher.  The Maru children are following in their parents' footsteps and attend boarding schools, but their world is turned upside down when their brother, Tiro, only seventeen, is arrested at school and charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.  Tiro and his co-conspirators' fictional trial mirrors the infamous Rivonia Trial of 1963-64 in Pretoria in which a number of defendants were accused of similar crimes, including a lawyer and activist named Nelson Mandela.<br /><br />The trial takes a toll on the entire family, but it especially impacts the Marus' only daughter, Neo.  She must draw on the strength and wisdom of her mother and grandmother as she comes of age in a very volatile environment.  In the end, Neo leaves South Africa, but returns many years later, triumphant in ways that her brothers only dreamed.<br /><br />Malepe effectively uses Mamogashwa, a giant snake that is actually a white woman, as a symbol of apartheid.  She draws a convincing parallel between Mamogashwa's evils and the horrible iniquity of apartheid, destroying black youth at will.  MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH is powerful and patriotic.  The Marus' story will bring perspective to how families struggled on a daily basis under apartheid and engender a new respect for the sacrifices of millions of black South Africans.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersrespect for the sacrifices of millions of black South Africans. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
Not Guilty	In his book NOT GUILTY, Creflo Dollar reminds us that we cannot purchase our salvation. This gift was already bought and paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ.  Simply put, God just wants us to believe in him!  \\"Our attitude should resemble the attitude of God\\"  (Philippians 2:5, 6) and we should aspire to conduct ourselves more like Jesus did while he was on the Earth.<br /><br />Dollar explains that righteousness is something that is available to everyone - Christians and non-Christians; however, it's based on personal choice to stand with God. He compares this principle to a master key that will unlock our blessings. It is important to be renewed in the word of God to have a successful life filled with prosperity. To be prosperous, we must first take care of our personal needs and then try to impact the live of others.  This right standing with God ultimately leads to the joy of salvation.<br /><br />This covenant is a bond to God, which compels us to lean on our blind faith, and Christian values. To aid in our understanding, Dollar differentiates between a belief  and our faith.  A belief is defined as something that is mentally accepted as truth, although absolute certainty may be absent.  Whereby faith is defined as acting on what you believe.  Therefore, faith is what carries belief into action.  A simple example of faith is a chair.  What is she talking about you may ask?  The explanation is easy.  When you sit on a chair, you don't give it much thought, but you have the faith that the chair will support your weight.  This same type of faith is crucial in our relationship with God.  Dollar urges Christians to match their actions to their faith.  In the New International Version of the Bible, James 2:17 states that \\"faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.\\"<br /><br />NOT GUILTY is not a book to take lightly.  It requires careful reading and meditation.  It provides biblical understanding to the precepts of kingdom principles. The flow is easy, not preachy.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - Open Your Mind	WU-LING & I-LUNG is a re-telling of a traditional Chinese tale.  I-lung and his father Wu-lung live together in a forest on the outskirts of town.  Wu-lung was a sought after calligrapher and he taught his son his special trade.  He was adamantly opposed to Buddhism, and on his death bed, he made his son promise to never to copy the Lotus Sutra (teachings of the Buddha).  I-lung kept his promise for many years all while continuing the family business in calligraphy.  One day however, I-lung is forced to make a decision which would require him to break his promise to his father.  He later learns that this choice is life-changing not only for him, but also for those he cares for very deeply.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful educational tool and the story is quite interesting.  I would suggest this book for older readers because of the advanced vocabulary and minimalist illustrations.  WU-LUNG & I-LUNG is a well put together package that includes pronunciation keys, a glossary, additional background information on the story and other resources.  This book will serve as a good introduction to Buddhism, and more importantly, it teaches valuable lessons about open-mindedness and religious tolerance.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26

The Bricks are Brown...	THE SCHOOL IS NOT WHITE! is a work of historical fiction that is set in Drew, Mississippi in 1965.  In the story, young readers are introduced to Matthew and Mae Bertha Carter, sharecroppers and parents who only want the best for their children.  The Carter's believed that in order for their children to have success in life they needed the best possible education.  Because of this, they decided to go against local convention and send their children to \\"all white schools.\\"  This choice did not go unpunished, the children were ostracized by both classmates and teachers, and the family was forced to move when the owner of the land would no longer allow them to sharecrop.  However, as a result of the faith and perseverance of the family and assistance from local and national groups who supported their cause, things began to change.  The book concludes with an author's note and a brief history of the Carter family, which lets readers know what happened in the real lives of the people who inspired the book.<br /><br />Doreen Rappaport has written a story that teaches children that even ordinary people can stand up and make a real difference in their community.  Further, the story highlights the importance of faith, strength in times of adversity, and courage.  Curtis James does a wonderful job illustrating the book.  Through his artistry, readers can see the story unfold and see the emotions the characters feel through the expressions depicted in the richly detailed pictures.  THE SCHOOL IS NOT WHITE! is a great introduction to the Civil Rights Movement, and particularly the important role children played in it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
Go Get Your Girlfriend	A COLLAGE OF LIFE is the quintessential \\"girlfriend\\" book in the style of Waiting to Exhale and other similar novels featuring ensemble casts of female characters.  One of the few differences here is that all five women are involved in committed relationships and none are single mothers.  This is a novel of friendship, camaraderie, and loyalty.  The extended plot touches on a huge variety of issues.  You name it and these characters experienced it - anything from drug abuse to \\"middle child\\" syndrome to the \\"glass ceiling.\\"<br /><br />The two main characters, Angel and Autumn, have been friends since childhood.  Together with their girls, the trash-talking Wanda and the happily married Lynne and Michelle, Angel and Autumn have created a cozy niche in Savannah, Georgia that keeps them rooted in reality.  The scene where the girls strut into a birthday party in their ultra-chic clothing and designer shoes defines the tenor of the entire novel.  This is the story of beautiful, successful, hard-working black women with firm identities.  Although they have trials and doubts from time to time, they rely on each other to stay on task and keep moving in a positive direction.<br /><br />This is a really enjoyable light, summer read for lying on the beach or lounging at home in your pajamas.  It has hot sex, tender romance, and comical moments with family and friends that will have you laughing out loud.  Lisa Harris and Tuesday Hambric make it easy to become engrossed in the girlfriends' lives.  The authors write well together, so there is no obvious seam that one author wrote one chapter while the other wrote another.  Reading A COLLAGE OF LIFE will be time spent that you won't regret.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26

This book will be your inspirational cheerleader to remind you of God's awesome goodness.  From Genesis to Revelation, this book is chock full of reminders relating to God's wonderfulness.  The first step in recognizing God's potential is accepting Him as your personal Lord and Savior.  By understanding the truth of the words in the Bible and believing in the goodness of God is the foundation of our faith, Mrs. Copeland states, \\"He will restore wholeness in your life, spirit, soul and body.\\"  She cites Psalm 84 which tells us that \\"No good thing will be withheld from those who walk uprightly.\\"<br /><br />The book is laced with metaphorical encouragement that just prompts the reader to be enlightened and renewed.  One passage that stuck with me was \\"Feed your heart with the goodness of God.\\"  Here, Ms. Copeland is urging readers to not only trust God for eternal salvation but challenges us to see the daily goodness of God in the land of the living.  He is a redeemer, a conqueror, and all in all, He is love!

Murder for the Greater Good	After the success of his debut novel Drop, Mat Johnson has returned to the literary scene with his second novel, winner of the 2004 Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for fiction, HUNTING IN HARLEM.  This the story of three ex-cons who are recruited by a Harlem real estate company to get a second chance at making good with their lives.  Horizon Realty has set a plan in motion to stop the gentrification of Harlem by upper class whites and reinvigorate a sagging economy by re-populating the neighborhood with good, honest, black folk.  But like any area suffering from urban blight, you have your unwanted denizens:  the pushers, the whores, the child molesters, and the gun runners.  It's hard to create a family neighborhood with these types as residents; so when they start to have convenient accidents, it's all good.<br /><br />Snowden, Bobby, and Horus begin life after incarceration as interns with Horizon, literally working their way from the bottom up.  Supposedly, they will be introduced to the world of real estate and trained to be real estate agents.  But the trio soon discovers that they were chosen for their new jobs specifically because of their pasts.  Snowden's lover, Piper Goines, is a reporter for a local minority owned newspaper, and it isn't long before she senses something foul at Horizon and starts investigating.<br /><br />Mat Johnson has used his considerable talents to explore current urban social problems, but he also touches on cultural pursuits by subtly raising the topic of popular urban fiction and the lack of love received by black writers who study their craft and spend years writing literate, thought-provoking books only to be outsold by upstarts supplying readers with \\"melaninized, low-tech versions of their afternoon soaps.\\"  Johnson, as usual, is smart, witty, and destined to be one of his generation's best writers.  The plot moves quickly once the introductory matter is out of the way.  A well-executed example of fine literature, HUNTING IN HARLEM will keep you thinking about contemporary urban issues... and looking over your shoulder.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersHARLEM will keep you thinking about contemporary urban issues... and looking over your shoulder. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
A long time coming...	Tired of trying to climb the ladder to being a top model, Morgan Allgood realizes because of her age, gigs are becoming few and far between.  While watching a football game, she wonders if she has the potential to become a sideline commentator.  After researching the possibility, Morgan travels to Chicago for an interview with ESPN.  Having just left the interview, she spots the dashingly handsome weatherman Van McNeil.  It has been eight long months since their last encounter, one she has never forgotten.<br /><br />Van had been a child when he first laid eyes on Morgan, and from that day on he knew that she would become his wife.  So when Van sees her again, memories of him walking out on their first date resurface.  His problem--will Morgan forgive him for his past mistakes.  Once he regains her confidence, they share a night of intimacy but this time when all is said and done, Morgan walks out of his apartment and his life.  Knowing she has made a big mistake by sleeping with Van, Morgan seeks refuge at her friend's clothing design studio.  To keep from thinking about him she channels all her energy into making a wedding dress; she has been procrastinating about for months, for her sister.  With wedding dress in hand, Morgan dashes off to the airport to catch a flight home to Atlanta.  However, when her flight is delayed indefinitely and there are no rental cars available, her only recourse is to ask Van for a ride.<br /><br />Kim Louise's latest installment in the Allgood series is one that is sure to please.  Morgan and Van's story was very realistic.  Their trek home was heartfelt, funny, adventurous and full of zany characters they encountered along the way.  Although, I own several of Ms. Louise's novels, this is my second in the Allgood series.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - A Diverse Collection	BUTTER BROWN is a collection of sixteen short stories written by Torrance Stephens.  The stories take place in a variety of settings both in North America and Africa, are told from the first person point of view, and cover a broad range of subjects and themes.  They are emotionally intense, political, at times erotic, and urge the reader to reflect on the subtleties of the content.  One of my favorites, \\"Shannon and the Maharaja,\\" is unique in that it is told from a woman's perspective.  Maharaja in Hindu means great king, and in the very brief story, the narrator relates her experience with a man whom she initially thinks has very little to offer; later however, she realizes that he taught her more than she could have ever anticipated.  Another favorite was \\"The Police State,\\" a story about a man who fought in the Vietnam War, only to return home and have a hard time supporting himself.  He resorts to cleaning windows as a means of survival, but finds that he is the target of harassment from police.  Like most of the others in the collection, the literal meaning is interesting, but upon further reflection of the language and symbolism the stories take on a deeper, more satisfying meaning.<br /><br />BUTTER BROWN not only showcases Torrance Stephens' abilities as a writer, but also his broad range of personal experiences and familiarity with other cultures, both national and international.  In each story, the settings, though diverse, are presented with an intimacy that reflects the author's knowledge of the various cultural nuances.  This is noted not only in the descriptive use of language, but also through his use of colloquialisms unique to a certain area.  Fortunately for those less traveled, he includes definitions and other helpful information in the footnotes.  The only real shortfall of the book was in the area of characterization.  It seemed as if Stephens had created two prototypes, one for the male characters and the other for the female characters and simply changed the name of the characters in each story.  The similarity among the characters in the different stories was so confusing that it took away from the overall collection.  Still, it is obvious the author is a talented writer, with a unique style and a lot to say.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerssimply changed the name of the characters in each story.

Wouldn't it be nice if Mr. Right would just ride up on his proverbial white horse, knock on our front door and sweep us off our feet? In DOWN FOR WHATEVER, this is the desired scenario for Keith, Tommie, Rafael and Marco. Each is seemingly looking for Mr. Right in all the wrong places. Each hails from various backgrounds, yet when thrust into the fast-paced limelight of Los Angeles, will they be able to stake their claim on true love?<br /><br />All of the characters have their individual concerns, which unite them together. As the lead singer of an R&B group from back in the day, Tommie was \\"Mr. It\\" back then. Hooking up was not an issue. Now that he is a little older and has reached the big 3-0 mark, he is still clinging to his celebrity status with his much younger, jock boyfriend on his arm. Will Tommie's insecurities plague him from allowing love to blossom? Marco finds himself in a quandary when dealing with a long distance relationship. Can he stay faithful despite all of the temptation that presents itself each day? Keith finally thinks he has found someone who is too-good-to-be-true, hopefully this isn't the case. Rafael casts caution to the wind and does whatever is clever and feels good at the moment. In the end, who ends up with a broken heart and who walks away happily ever after?<br /><br />The story is told from the first person, conversational perspective of the four friends.  Not being familiar with the gay lifestyle, the depictions of the scenes seemed believable and despite the protagonists' sexual preferences, I found myself pulling for them to realize the happiness that everyone deserves and shaking my head at some of their antics.  Although the it started out a little slow to me, if you're looking for a book that has handsome men, attitude galore, and relationship drama mixed with some same-sex partnering, then DOWN FOR WHATEVER may be the book for you.<br /><br />(...)	2005-08-26
Precious Gems	DYMOND IN THE ROUGH is the first of a new line of books known as the Platinum Teen Series.  We are introduced to Dymond a hip, popular, and well-grounded adolescent girl.  She lives with her mom, a single parent, who is strict, but available to her daughter.  They have open communication and Dymond's mom is dedicated to providing the right foundation for her daughter.  In the course of the story, we follow Dymond through her day-to-day life, and get a bird's-eye view of some of the experiences and issues faced by a more or less average girl.  She struggled with new and confusing feelings about boys, is tempted by her friends to do things she knows are wrong, is faced with several moral dilemmas, and is troubled by her father's inconsistent role in her life.<br /><br />DYMOND IN THE ROUGH is a dynamic introduction to this new series of books.  The characters are realistic and deal with issues that are current and relevant to the target audience. The book's urban flair will appeal to hip-hop generation readers, while the lack of profanity and overly mature storylines will appeal to parents.  Primarily character driven, and told from the first person perspective, the book immediately draws you in and almost forces you to empathize with Dymond.  Her character isn't perfect; yet, she clearly knows right from wrong and aspires towards the high road.  The book exudes positive messages about the importance of education, communication between parents and children, resisting peer pressure and on and on, yet it never comes across as preachy.  DYMOND IN THE ROUGH is a double bonus; a page turner for young readers and a book that parents of adolescents can feel comfortable allowing their child to read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
A Focused Study	Beth Moore chose to delve into the life and times of David, a mere shepherd boy who was chosen to be the leader of Israel.  In A HEART LIKE HIS, Moore poses the practical questions as to how a person can be forgiven and restored after sin?  How a person can continue to be faithful when nothing seems to be going his way?  How can a person find God when feeling lonely?  How important is God's influence on our family?<br /><br />Moore begins the journey into David's life in the book of 1 Samuel.  She uses several Biblical references and provides background into the trials and tribulations David faced.  With God's assistance, David rose from basic obscurity into a position of amazing power.  When he operates outside of God's will, he makes an unwise decision that will prove to unravel his long reign and have dire consequences on his family.  In his earlier times, Moore depicts David who continually seeking God's guidance and is quick to offer praise to God.  Yet, David was a man with a weakness for beautiful women.  Although he was married, David enjoyed the attention his power garnered him from the fairer sex.  Moore enhances the reader's understanding of how David's adulterous conduct with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband cast David out of God's will.  On this subject, Moore states that David had a \\"far away heart.\\"  It was not until David was \\"bankrupt in spirit\\" over the death of his illegitimate son that he repented for his sins.  Moore reminds the reader that although God will forgive us of our sins, He will pass judgement on us.<br /><br />In A HEART LIKE HIS, Moore does a very good job of setting the scene.  She takes us back to the beginning even before David had knowledge of the greater things in store for him.  The book's lessons are based mainly on 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel. A HEART LIKE HIS would be a great tool for individual or group study.  Each chapter is laden with cross-references to other Biblical references.  At times, it was confusing because the complete Biblical citation was not used in the text.  However, this was not distracting enough to detract from the great presentation of King David's reign.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerscause the complete Biblical citation was not used in the text.

Hustlers need love too......	Portia Lane was introduced to the world of stripping as a means of monetary support while attending school.  However, with degree in hand, she is still unwilling to tear herself away from the hustling lifestyle.  The money she makes, in a couple of nights, affords her to live comfortably without the monotony of a regular nine to five. When she finds herself falling in love with Jay Mitchell, one of her regulars, she decides to stop stripping, get a real job and let him know how she feels.<br /><br />True to his game, Jay knew that Portia was not \\"wifey\\" material, but that didn't stop him from caring about her. Once she makes her intentions known, little by little, Portia is able to melt the iceberg; a result of major baby mama drama, surrounding Jay's heart.  Jay swiftly falls in love and what ensues is a street saga and fairy tale romance between two people destined to be together, all rolled into one.<br /><br />Caroline McGill has written a very gritty tale filled with jealousy, rage, drugs, lies, and deceit.  The storyline is realistic and readers will enjoy how the relationship between Portia and Jay evolves.  Readers will encounter a few punctuation and grammatical errors; however, they are not a distraction.  I finished the book in a few hours and did not want to see it end.

(RAW Rating: 4.5) -  It Won't Happen to Me	In Alan Lawrence Sitomer's novel we meet Andre Anderson, an African-American teen nicknamed, \\"The Hoopster.\\"  Andre is athletic, does well in school, and is an aspiring writer.  He has landed the internship of his dreams, working for a small local magazine.  His next door neighbor Shawn, although white, is like a brother to him, and at the open of the book, they are enjoying a happy and relatively uneventful summer.<br /><br />When Andre is asked to write a feature story about racism for the magazine, initially he is put off by the topic.  He doesn't think he has experienced racism personally, and feels that a lot of people use race as a crutch instead of assuming personal responsibility.  When his boss refuses to let him off the hook, Andre works hard and creates a heartfelt article that gains him a lot of attention.  Unfortunately, his article catches the eye of a local hate group and he becomes the victim of a senseless and brutal hate crime that threatens to change his life forever.  He must rely on his family, friends (Shawn in particular), and all of his strength to overcome his physical and emotional wounds.<br /><br />THE HOOPSTER is the first of a planned trilogy of books.  The story is well-written, with believable characters and a good pace.  As I read, I found myself thinking over and over, how nice it would be to see this book played out on the silver screen.  The book has an urban feel, yet it doesn't buy into the prevalent stereotypes and includes young people with positive dreams and goals, who live in two-parent households with caring adults.  While the main character is black, the supporting characters come from diverse backgrounds, making this a story that will attract a diverse audience of readers.  While girls may enjoy this book, boys, even those who tend to be more reluctant to read, will especially like this engrossing and realistic story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
Obey and Be Blessed	BUILDING WEALTH THROUGH SPIRITUAL HEALTH is a journey through spiritual guidance and counsel to explain the importance of placing your faith and money in God.  This candid snapshot of reality is laden with bible verses, stressing the values of reading and understanding the principles associated with tithing and money management.<br /><br />Backed by biblical principles, this book speaks honestly and forthright on what God really says about money and getting your financial house in order.  Broken down from the beginning, everything is outlined, with specialized topics such as Spiritual Disobedience and the Results, to the prosperity you encounter when you are in line with the Word and being obedient to it.  Providing insight on real life topics such as Investing, Debt Management, Retirement and Real Estate, these guidance modules are demonstrated and backed up with scripture.<br /><br />Danny Freeman does an excellent job in breaking down a lot of questions that have gone through the minds of not just Christians, but everyone wanting to understand the principle of how God wants to bless you financially.  I've never encountered a book that gives these principles to you plain and simple.  It definitely helps clear up some misconceptions and false teachings that we all have encountered at some point in our lives, and I encourage everyone to read it while having their personal bible at hand.  I highly recommend this book to anyone; the Word does not disappoint.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
(RAW Rating: 3.5) - School Daze	In the last one hundred years, Greek life on college campuses has become a staple in the lives of young, African-American men and women.  Fraternities and sororities offer students the opportunity to socialize and bond with others of similar character, while inspiring them to contribute their time and talents to their communities.  LAZARUS by Rashid Darden is a two-fold story of a young, African-American man coming of age at an elite, predominantly white university.<br /><br />Adrian Collins wants to make a difference in the life of others.  As vice-president of the campus chapter of the NAACP, he thought that was enough, but once he was introduced to the men of Beta Chi Phi fraternity, he realized that there was more he could be doing.  Feeling abandoned by his father, Adrian seeks that familial bond with the pledges and brothers of Beta Chi Phi.<br /><br />In addition to making the adjustment from an all-black environment in high school to being in the minority at his campus, he is also struggling with how to publicly embrace his homosexuality, but still be accepted by those he emulates.  Adrian has always known he was gay and is keenly aware of the ostracism it may cause him to experience at the hands of people he respects.  These two desires frequently clash, but Adrian stays true to himself and refuses to compromise his ideals.  His underground relationship with his boyfriend, Savion, however, is suffering while he goes through the grueling pledge process.<br /><br />Rashid Darden has produced a vivid description of fraternity life on a predominantly white campus.  LAZARUS is fun and light, but also engenders poignant moments that underscore the meaning of fraternity and the closeness of the bond that is shared.  He has also created some memorable characters which he has already written into the sequel to this novel, Covenants, due out in 2006.  LAZARUS is an enjoyable read and I look forward to the sequel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
The Mark	BOURBON STREET is the story of a complicated family whose visceral interest in poker leads the other characters through a labyrinth of games.  The story starts out detailing the purpose of the Moreaus' poker extravaganza, but soon strays to more carnal issues amidst the decadence of Mardi Gras and post-war New Orleans.<br /><br />August Moreau is a wealthy man whose ego is so massive that he made the arrogant mistake of thinking his white society friends would accept him living openly with his black mistress, Christine, and rejoice with him at the birth of his mixed race son.  He soon discovers who his real friends are and makes a point to keep them close and his enemies closer through brutal vigilante enforcement of his every desire.<br /><br />Alex Moreau is a bi-racial, very disturbed, and very angry young man whose invincibility has been assured by his white father's notorious menace and wealth.  No one in New Orleans would dare cross August Moreau, even if he did elevate his bastard son higher than most white men.  His treatment of Alex provokes outrage and alienation among the citizenry, but it is Christine's death that drives a permanent wedge between father and son.  Her death and his tenuous position in life - a wealthy black man with no real power of his own - fuels his rage and creates a desire to obliterate everything that is Moreau.<br /><br />Using an annual poker game to set his vicious plan in motion, Alex has invited a new player to the game in addition to his father's usual select guest list for this high stakes affair, and Deke Watley, a two-bit card hustler from Dallas, can't resist the urge of easy money and lots of it.  Deke's greed leads him back to a former love whose tarnished image has evolved, yet remained the same, over the years.  Now, she is trying to find a way to bury it in the past and re-incarnate her lost innocence by betraying the only person who could redeem her.<br /><br />Leonce Gaiter is rapidly ensconcing himself as a master of noire mystery.  His characters in BOURBON STREET literally jump off the page at you.  Their pasts, feelings, and secret motives are known instantly, but the mystery of the story is preserved until the end.  The gift is that his characters are not scripted in narrative, but carved lovingly in dialogue and action.  From semi-shrouded Ray, whose soul has become as scarred as his face, to hard-hearted Hannah, who only wants to be clean and pure again in everyone's eyes, Gaiter does an exceptional job of making the reader see, feel, hear, and smell the sights, sounds, and textures of Mardi Gras 1958.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersmaster of noire mystery.

From semi-shrouded Ray, whose soul has become as scarred as his face, to hard-hearted Hannah, who only wants to be clean and pure again in everyone's eyes, Gaiter does an exceptional job of making the reader see, feel, hear, and smell the sights, sounds, and textures of Mardi Gras 1958. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-08-26
Friends till the end	JUST BETWEEN US by Wyndy J. Adkins is a novel based on the trials and tribulations of three best friends, Ebony, Mona and ShaLisa.<br /><br />Reeling from a devastating divorce Ebony, a flight attendant, meets the dashingly handsome Jackson during one of their many girl's night out activities.  Although Jackson is a kind, respectful and loving person Ebony has a hard time trusting him or any man for that matter.

Their fairy tale marriage is missing only one thing, a baby.  After two miscarriages they are determined to conceive a child if it's the last thing they do.  When a tragedy happens in her life, Mona will have to depend on her two best friends to see her through.<br /><br />ShaLisa, the wildest of the three, is the manager of a clothing boutique. Since she is having trouble finding her Mr. Right, she spends her days stringing men along until she tires of them.  Finally, ShaLisa feels she has found someone with whom she is willing to settle down.  However, if his identity is revealed it may very well cause her to lose one of her most cherished friends.<br /><br />Small in size, JUST BETWEEN US is a very inspiring story of how three friends remain together through the good and bad times.  Although they all were faced with issues in their lives, they still found the time to be there for each other.  For those in need of a shoulder to cry on, a much-needed hug or a little prayer to see you through, I recommend you read this book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
What We Created	For Jill Nelson, Martha's Vineyard has become more than a vacation spot.  It is a place of rejuvenation and rebirth, inspiration and motivation.  She shares everything this island has come to embody to many of its black residents in FINDING MARTHA'S VINEYARD: African Americans at Home on an Island.  Tracing the roots of the island's black inhabitants to slaves and servants brought there by their owners/employers, Jill Nelson follows this trail to the modern day residents who are slowly seeing their way of life slipping away as the once all-black communities become more integrated.<br /><br />Sustained primarily with interviews of African-American residents of Martha's Vineyard, the book is part memoir, but at the same time, part travelogue, part history, and part cookbook.  One interview subject, Vernon Jordan, former presidential advisor to Bill Clinton and former Urban League president, reminisces that the constituency of the black residents has changed over the years.  Back in the `70s when he first started visiting the island, every person there was a doctor, lawyer, or teacher - the epitome of W.E.B. Dubois' Talented Tenth.  Now, the gamut is expanded.  You see black businesspeople, investment bankers, and CEOs.<br /><br />Nelson also explores the social and artistic outlets on the island.  The island has offered social outlets to black middle class families who struggle to interact with more African-American families as their economic status rises and their subdivisions become whiter.  Many of these families have been coming to Martha's Vineyard for generations, as evidenced by the Shearer family who have owned a house on the island since the turn of the twentieth century.  The island has also offered artistic freedom to writers, painters, sculptors, and others who seek the complacency of the island to hone their craft.  This island has been home to many famous artists, academicians, and politicians.<br /><br />Jill Nelson vividly describes life on Martha's Vineyard in this all-encompassing work.  FINDING MARTHA'S VINEYARD is lyrical in style when Nelson uses her own voice, but just as entrancing when hearing the voices of the residents.  Their recollections and obvious joy in sharing their past, including a few family recipes, gives the work a unique allure.  Historically accurate and socially stimulating, readers will feel like they have spent a good portion of their lives on this island as well.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersa's Vineyard in this all-encompassing work.

Have faith	In BREAKING OUT OF TROUBLE, Dr. Dollar offers a discussion of peace, joy and healing.  He reminds us that as heirs of God, salvation is our ultimate inheritance.  To gain this inheritance, we must be born again, which is a conscious spirit experience of repentance and moving from darkness into light.  Dr. Dollar highlights Psalm 103, which lists the benefits of salvation, including forgiveness, redemption, mercy and renewal, just to name a few!<br /><br />Dr. Dollar cautions us that as we grow roots in God, it may seem that our trials and tribulations increase, but not to fear because in Jesus Christ there is peace!  Our faith can help us to overcome the world's system that is plagued with adversity and questionable values.  Joy is another spiritual force that will aid in our conquering of trouble.  Although God's goodness and mercy provide a covering to us, we still have a responsibility of what is or is not happening in our lives.  God has a covenant of peace with us.  The devil's job is to try to destroy this covenant and our job is to be cognizant of temptation and not yield to it.<br /><br />In BREAKING OUT OF TROUBLE, Dr. Dollar provides a wonderful prescription of how someone can build up their personal peace by having the faith in casting their cares to God.  The book is written in a very thorough, thought-provoking manner.  While reading this book, I often found myself taking notes and frequently referencing the quoted passages in my Bible.  Once again, Dr. Dollar's ministry has provided an inspirational yet educational message that is right on time!<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
Love Potions	Since the deaths of her parents, Kate Duncan, who is surprisingly the daughter of an earl, has had to endure being belittled by her money hungry aunt.  In order to have a somewhat pleasant life, Kate has to live with her aunt and serve as a chaperone to her cousin Melanie.  When they are invited to London, England for a dinner party, Melanie asks Kate to help her in luring the man of her dreams by using a magic love potion.  All she has to do is get close enough to Marcus Pelham, the Earl of Stamford, to put the potion in his drink.  Since the dinner party is not scheduled until the next day, Kate ponders over her plan of action.  Meanwhile, because she feels her cousin has been deceived, she drinks the potion instead to prove her point.  Kate starts<br /><br />having hallucinations and ends up in the bedchamber of a man she has never seen before.<br /><br />While engaged in an extremely provocative sexual act, Marcus notices Kate watching him.  He does not know who she is and seeks to find out the identity of the woman staying in his home.  When Marcus sees her at the dinner party, Kate is at a loss for words when she realizes that Marcus was not just a figment of her imagination, so she steers clear of him.  Marcus, on the other hand, would like to get to know her a little better.  When Kate refuses his advances, he uses his power and status to make her his bed partner.<br /><br />Cheryl Holt has written a very touching romance.  While the hot and steamy sex scenes will have you fanning, there seems to be something missing.  Ms. Holt rushes through, in my opinion, what should have been a very awe-inspiring tale of finding never-ending love. The storyline has a great concept and with a little fine-tuning will make for a wonderful read.  Although this was my first novel by Ms. Holt, it certainly will not be the last.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-26
The True Meaning of Love	DADDY'S GIRL is a chilling tale of love gone bad.  As the story opens, readers are immediately touched by the poignant tale of love between Brenda and Bruce.  Soon readers are slapped in the face by the chilling violence Brenda must endure at the hands of a once charming husband.  A few children later, Brenda mysteriously leaves the family and this is when the true horror begins.  Leona, the oldest daughter from this union, bears the brunt of her father's inappropriate attention, becoming a victim of sexual abuse.  As the story unfolds, more and more horrors are revealed and the devastating impact of abuse is boldly demonstrated.<br /><br />This is a hard-hitting, emotional tale about the far-reaching impact of all forms of abuse.  Wattley did a decent job highlighting the emotional turmoil and confusion that result from victimization.  However, I felt the author's characterizations were weak, there was not enough character development for me to really understand why the various characters behaved as they did, and too much was left unexplained.  Further, most of the young characters seemed incongruent; their precocious speech patterns and philosophical ramblings seemed inconsistent with their naïvet&eacute;. For example, it seemed unrealistic for a child who could fluently discuss something as complex as the nature of God to not understand something as basic as the meaning of virginity.  My other issue with the book was that the ending was very abrupt, and while there were some issues that were wrapped up at the close, I just didn't walk away with the sense that the story was over.  DADDY'S GIRL sheds light on a serious topic and despite its weaknesses, it is an average read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-17
(RAW Rating: 3.5) - The Missing Link	Darrius McMillan is the 13-year-old main character in A HOLE IN MY HEART.  The book is co-written by Edward Booker (a 14-year-old) and his aunt, Rose Jackson-Beavers.  Darrius doesn't know who his father is, and he and his sister live with his grandmother because his mother's drug addiction makes it impossible for her to care for them.  Darrius is an excellent student, involved in extracurricular activities at school, and active in his grandmother's church.  Yet more and more, he is plagued by feelings of uneasiness and a sense that a part of himself is missing.  These feelings stem from his desire to know his father's identity, his mother's addiction and erratic behavior, peer pressure he encounters in school, and the sense of guilt he feels for burdening his grandmother with his care.  His grandmother never complains, and she encourages her grandchildren to remember the lessons they have learned at the Adventist church they attend: to have faith in God and always pray.<br /><br />In addition to a supportive grandmother, Darrius is blessed with a loving and responsible aunt, with whom he can talk about anything.  He also has a special friendship with Nathan, a boy from his neighborhood, who practices a different religious denomination, but is equally spiritual.  Between his grandmother, aunt, and Nathan, Darrius has a lot of people he can talk to and pray about his problems with. When even those resources are not enough, his aunt pays for him to attend counseling sessions.  The story that unfolds as Darrius copes with the issues in his life is touching and wrought with great emotional highs and lows.  By the end of the book, I felt the same sense of peace and hope that he spent the entire book trying to achieve.<br /><br />I applaud Edward Booker and his aunt for taking on the daunting task of writing a fictional novel that deals with so many painful issues.  The characters were well-developed, and I particularly enjoyed the manner with which they incorporated each character's faith in God into the story.  I was a bit disappointed that even though they mentioned Darrius' entrance into counseling, there wasn't much emphasis on what the therapy entailed or the work involved in his growth process.  Also, while I realize that this book was co-written by a middle-schooler, it had numerous grammatical errors and would be greatly improved with further proofreading.  I feel it is especially important for books aimed at middle readers and young adults to model correct grammar, as it is an important skill that they are still developing.

(RAW Rating: 4.5) - New Adventures	A BRAVE SPACEBOY is a wonderful rhyming tale about a little boy who transforms his moving day into a great adventure.  In a new house filled with boxes which need unpacking, he and a couple of his new neighbors decide to pretend they are going into outer space.  With colanders and bowls for helmets and an empty box as a spaceship, the three children launch their great voyage into space.  On the trip, they use other household items to leave footprints in space, collect artifacts, plant flags and take souvenir photos.  Upon his return home, the brave spaceboy realizes that in addition to having fun, he has also made two new friends.<br /><br />Dana Smith's playful, rhyming words paired with Laura Freeman's detailed and engaging illustrations make this book a real treat to read.  A BRAVE SPACEBOY shows just how much fun children can have with ordinary kitchen items, a few empty boxes, and a little creativity.  In this age of cable and satellite television, DVD's, video game consoles and the like, children rely on their imaginations less and less.  This book re-affirms the simple things in life and will remind parents and teach children just how much fun a little innovation and imagination can be.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay (Children's Editor)<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-17
Getting To Know You	Albert Diggs has all his cards in order: fiance&eacute;, good job, and nice house.  Just when he thinks things are going his way, his job throws a wrench in his plans by asking him to transfer to Miami for a year to fix some problems in another division. Although he doesn't want to go, he realizes that this is an excellent opportunity to get the promotion he's been waiting for.<br /><br />Albert contemplates the move, but dreads telling the news to his fiance&eacute;, especially since their wedding was already rescheduled once before.  While having dinner with his parents, he brings up the new opportunity.  Before the evening is over, Albert is definitely relocating, has a rescheduled wedding date and a place to stay, rent-free.  Upon arriving in Miami, Albert realizes this new environment holds more than an opportunity for promotion, and he gets a chance to know a side of his grandfather that he never knew.<br /><br />Micheal J. Lore does a great job with this storyline.  Although fresh, true-to-life and hilariously funny, a major flaw in this manuscript was the constant presence of typographical, stylistic and grammatical errors.  It's in dire need of an editor.  His characters were down-to-earth, familiar and reminiscent of folks we all have flowing throughout our families.  From the non child-support paying cousin, to the crazy aunt, you won't be disappointed.  One thing I can say is the novel still proved to be a good, down-home laugh.  When this manuscript is edited, what a difference it will make.  (RAW Rating: 2.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewers	2005-08-13
Daddy Dearest	John Wallace, author of IT'S YOU, DADDY, has written a cute story about a daughter's love for her father.  As a little girl gets ready for bed, she asks her daddy a question: \\"Can you guess who my favorite person in the whole wide world is?\\"  When her father requests a few clues, she gives him hints.  He's big, strong, funny, caring, and other attributes her dad has.  In their conversation, she equates everything to a circus.  For example, when she says how big and strong he is, a strong man holding weights and resembling her daddy is shown.  When she says he helps her reach things up high, her daddy on stilts is shown.  Finally, after she's given him many more clues, she finally tells him it's him.<br /><br />The watercolors used for the illustrations bring out the circus theme and the fun in playing the guessing game.  I really enjoyed the interaction between father and daughter.  However, for the age range of four to eight, I think the book may be a bit too simplistic and would suggest it for  younger kids.  While the story is cute, older children may become bored because it's obvious after the first clue who the little girl is referring to.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - The company you keep...	Living in the quiet little town of Willow, Ohio, Kendra Clayton doesn't get too much excitement.  She spends her time working as an instructor and she also works at her uncle's restaurant as a hostess.  When her best friend Bernie decides to finally break it off with her freeloading, cheating boyfriend Jordan, Kendra is right there to comfort her, all the while trying to keep her snide comments about him to herself.  She wasn't too fond of Jordan,  but, before the celebration can actually begin, Bernie finds Jordan murdered at the house she's leasing out to another woman -- a woman Jordan was involved with.  Kendra is caught off guard, but regroups and goes into Nancy Drew mode.  Sticking by Bernie's side, Kendra withholds key information from the police.  Unfortunately, when she shares news of her findings, she's looked at too closely and is added to the list of possible suspects. This sets the stage for clearing not only her friend, but herself.<br /><br />I love a good mystery and working my brain trying to find out 'whodunit'.  Angela Henry has presented the first in a series of books focusing on average citizen Kendra Clayton.  I found THE COMPANY YOU KEEP to be an interesting, quick read, but I didn't feel overly connected to any of the characters.  The plot was intriguing and the resolution left me reflecting on how the things in one's past can always come back when least expected.<br /><br />Although I wasn't quite shocked at the ending, it wasn't overly predictable, rushed, or unbelievable, making this an enjoyable read I'd recommend to others.  I am definitely interested in finding out what Kendra will be up to next; especially since she's not the typical private investigator.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Daddy's little princess?	Out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and<br /><br />affirmation for her existence, MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT is born.<br /><br />Melda Beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young<br /><br />girl she has worth, beauty and unlimited potential. For a<br /><br />male love that is disconnected from possession, obsession or<br /><br />penetration; love that only a father can give. Never knowing<br /><br />that magnitude of love, she harbored ill feelings for her<br /><br />father. Traumatized since she was a little girl, her<br /><br />nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a<br /><br />legitimate voice, and truly forgave her father.<br /><br />Since her atonement, Ms. Beaty has been blessed to meet and<br /><br />share stories with other Black women with similar histories<br /><br />of overwhelming father-daughter relationships. Relationships<br /><br />that more often than not, define how we relate to the men in<br /><br />our lives. MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRT speaks of the totality of our<br /><br />lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with<br /><br />our fathers.<br /><br />MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT does not  bash fathers, however, it does<br /><br />present a penetrating view from every possible angle. The six<br /><br />powerful chapters, Loving: Daddy's Girl; Distant: Every Once<br /><br />in Awhile; Abandon: One Day He Was Gone; Non-Existent: Could<br /><br />Pass Me on the Street; Amended: Time and Forgiveness Heals<br /><br />All Wounds; and Deceased: Gone Too Soon, cover the gamut of<br /><br />emotions daughters have felt for fathers. I applaud Ms. Beaty<br /><br />and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing<br /><br />and strengthening for the family unit. I venture to say each<br /><br />reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings.<br /><br />This is a humbling read; an epiphany.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Exposing the myth	Using the history of Aunt Jemima as a springboard for researching<br />the affinity between African-Americans and food, BLACK HUNGER<br />focuses on debates that have been waged over the term 'soul food'<br />since the tumultuous era of the late 1960's and early 1970's.<br /><br />BLACK HUNGER looks specifically at how the association of African-<br />American women with food has helped structure twentieth-century<br />psychic, cultural, sociopolitical, and economic life in America.<br />An association that has blossomed into a complex web of political,<br />religious, sexual and racial tensions between Blacks and whites,<br />and within the Black community itself.<br /><br />Doris Witt uses vaudeville, literature, film and cookbooks to<br />explore how food has been used to perpetuate and challenge racial<br />stereotypes. Hence, the main focus is the controversy surrounding<br />the authenticity of soul food and stereotypical views of black<br />women in the United States. Witt fervidlyly contends that Aunt<br />Jemima was not only used to sell pancakes, but also to perpetuate<br />post-Civil War race and gender hierarchies, including the<br />subordination of African-American women as servants, and white<br />fantasies of the nurturing mammy.<br /><br />As I read this book, I sensed Witt raising her fist in a Black Power<br />salute and wielding her spatula like a sword; as if Aunt Jemima had<br />stepped off the pancake box with vengeance and fury. BLACK HUNGER,<br />which began many years ago as a dissertation at theUniversity of<br />Virginia, is now an extraordinary book that should claim a viable<br />place in African American history.

(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Lighten Up!	George Carlin has been offending audiences since the 1960s, and it's worked for him for over 30 years. So why should he change now? If anything, the world has provided more material for Carlin; more stupid things people do, more political dog and pony shows, more lapses of common sense. In his latest book of humor, WHEN WILL JESUS BRING THE PORK CHOPS?, Carlin provides the laugh-out-loud moments that make people wonder why you are laughing hysterically in a room by yourself.<br /><br />Ok, so Carlin isn't a comedian for the faint of heart, the easily offended, or the politically extreme. But everyone already knows that, and it's doubtful that these folks would even consider contributing to Carlin's wealth. However, for those who enjoy Carlin's observations, rantings, and satire, this book will provide a healthy dose of Carlinism.<br /><br />In some cases I stared blankly at the pages, wondering where he was going with certain passages, but that's the beauty of Carlin. You never know what's going to come out of his mouth, or in this case, his pen, and I think he likes it that way. I think his aim is to befuddle you every now and then. Nonetheless, while reading most of the passages, nuggets of wisdom, and scenes, I produced either a muted snicker, a head nod, or a gut-wrenching fit of laughter. Fans of Carlin will appreciate this book, and those who question the motives of America and the rest of the world will likely enjoy this journey to Carlin-dom.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13

Those involved in this project range from authors and journalists, to beauty, career and health advisors, but also includes doctors, activists, and those with seemingly ordinary lives, committed to various programs and causes.<br /><br />The book is designed to be a 31 day guide toward empowerment in which the contributors share many pieces of wisdom such as learning from elders, understanding your purpose, claiming what is meant for you, learning from life's lessons and growing as a result of them.  Also showcased are pieces on optimizing health, giving back to others, and finding your own voice.  Of the selections, I enjoyed many of the various anectdotes, stories, and reflections, yet some of my favorites, in addition to the highlights mentioned above, were learning to free yourself and letting go of grudges, as well as the sections on recalling memories and journaling as a means to improve one's emotional and physical state of mind.  To sum up each day is an affirmation, and the book concludes with a detailed biographical sketch of each contributor.<br /><br />Women seeking guidance, balance, and encouragement should pick up this gem of a book and lose themselves in the teachings, and fully realize their destined place in the world.  100 WORDS OF WISDOM will inspire and enrich the lives of every woman who reads it, applies it, and utilizes it as their guide on the journey to empowerment.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A woman scorned	In EVERY WOMAN NEEDS A WIFE, by Naleighna Kai, for better or worse is the resounding sentiment.  Brandi Spencer knew what she wanted early in life, but she didn't know that it might take her a few years to really know what sacrifices one has to make in a marriage. Brandi discovers that Vernon, her husband and business partner, has been less than faithful in their marriage. In fact, he has a completely new life somewhere else with a mistress.  Brandi wants to benefit from having a mistress too, so she concocts a plan.  The only catch is who will reap the most benefits from her scheme.<br /><br />Tanya, the mistress, is sure to keep you interested in her tale as well, because she agrees to keep up the role as \\"wife\\" to Brandi.  She finds herself in the middle of a triangle and since it's payback time, Tanya must earn her keep. She also has to confront her past in order to secure her future. Though she ran away from home years before, the demons resurface and begin challenging her, even in her new life.  Things come full circle, as she faces the memories of her childhood, and she is forced to take control for the last time.<br /><br />EVERY WOMAN NEEDS A WIFE is hilarious and thought-provoking. I really enjoyed this book and it has brought out a lot of discussion amongst my book club members. As a single female who has been married, it made me wonder just how many women would really befriend their husband's mistress.  Not many women think they would benefit from their husband's infidelity.  However, Vernon is not alone in this world in his plight to have his cake and eat it too, but when faced with a plan like Brandi's, he really only had two ways to react -- get out or stay put.  Kai has given an original twist to an age-old problem that shows the many dynamics of marriage and what one must do to get over the betrayal.  It also shows that it is possible to can heal from past wrongs.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Nina Lewis<br />TRR Guest Reviewer	2005-08-13
The window...	Narrated by a young girl, THE HELLO, GOODBYE WINDOW is an endearing story that details the importance of a very special window and the grandparents who live on the other side of it.  The little girl uses the window to greet her grandparents, play games, look out at the world, and wave goodbye at the end of her trip.<br /><br />I enjoyed THE HELLO, GOODBYE WINDOW and its view of the relationship between children and their grandparents.  The drawings are almost kid-like scribbles that give the story a more child-like appeal, complementing the narration.  The colors are bright and craftily tell the story of those passing the windows, Poppy's harmonica playing, the dark blue/black sky and the stars that inhabit it.  Juster does a wonderful job of showing the world through the eyes of a child and her connection of all things important to the kitchen window.  Additionally, teaching children about interracial families (depicted in the drawings, not the words) is a good way to introduce those children of mixed heritage.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

(RAW Rating: 4.5) - The light within...	THE LIGHT IN THE DARK by 11-year-old Eric I. Keyes, III teaches a wonderful lesson about not being afraid at night when it's time to go to bed.  The book opens at bedtime when a little boy cries out to his parents, asking them to leave the light on because he's afraid of the dark.  After a bit of talking amongst themselves, his mother and father tell him about the light inside his head and how he can make it come on and all the wonderful things that can result from his light.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading THE LIGHT IN THE DARK both alone and also with my daughter who is afraid of the dark. Though she isn't quite old enough to fully understand the light within, it is a wonderful story for parents to share with their children.  I loved the positive tones of the story, the rhythm and rhyme of the words, as well as the beautiful illustrations by Paula Marie.  Though minor, the only thing I didn't really care for was how the artwork was reproduced.  While I was pleased with the bright vivid colors and distinctly drawn characters, they appeared to be stretched across the page to fit the page size instead of being drawn to scale.  Children may not notice, but it made the images look distorted and distracted somewhat from their beauty.  A plus is that the book includes a word list, glossary, discussion questions, and a place where readers can jot down their thoughts on a journal page.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to parents, teachers, and librarians to share the inspiring message of a person's goodness and how they can not only help themselves but others as a result of their \\"light.\\"  Additionally, it is great to see such a young author giving back to the community and helping children to overcome their fear of the dark.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Although this was a predictable storyline; overbearing parents not liking their son's choice, with characters who offered few surprises, the author still manages to keep the story entertaining. I would have liked more confrontation as the drama unfolded, but I still enjoyed reading about the unscrupulous things people do as the title says, IN THE NAME OF LOVE.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
(RAW Rating: 3.5) The spiritual awakening of a priest	THE MAN WITH NO SKIN by Orfhlaith N&iacute; Chonaill opens as the market place in a small village in Kenya is set on fire by persons unknown. It is such an important event because the market embodies the livelihood of so many of the villagers. Two men are captured, have tires placed around their necks, and after being doused with gasoline, they are set on fire. The priest, Ciar&aacute;n, attempts to stop it but he is too late. Understanding the outrage of the villagers at having their lives disrupted, he forgives them and lets the police think that the burnt men are villagers who were accidentally killed. A deacon is very upset with him and tells the bishop, causing grief for the priest. This particular deacon is a priest-wanna-be and he constantly tattles on Ciar&aacute;n. Ciar&aacute;n also discovers that, even though he has taken a vow of celibacy, one of the young Kenyan women is extremely attractive to him and she finds him equally alluring. It causes him to make moves to remove her from his sight. We also catch glimpses of Ciar&aacute;n's life in Ireland, both before and after he became a priest.<br /><br />Irungu and his wife, Wambui, play significant parts as their lives as Kenyan villagers emerges and they struggle for survival as well as adjusting to the new way of life inspired by the Europeans. Ciaran notices Irungu's latent anger at the European intrusion but he doesn't fully understand it until he goes on a field trip with archeologist, Julius, who tells him the legend of 'the man with no skin.' Until that point, he has been able to say to himself that people who lived long ago caused the ills that continue to plague Africa and he bears no guilt. As he grows spiritually, he sees that the same racism and issues exist and he is helping perpetuate them. Finally, a physical dilemma causes Ciar&aacute;n to question his entire life as a priest and he wonders if the priesthood is really his calling.<br /><br />Chonaill has written a compelling novel that delves into the AIDS epidemic that is decimating entire villages in Kenya, as well as exploring the ills caused by Europeans replacing Africa's religion and way of life with those things European. It is full of little known tidbits about the culture of Kenya that were very intriguing as well as helpful in understanding how and why Africa is as it stands today. I did get a bit confused as Irungu was introduced in the beginning of the book and it felt as if it was his life we were reading about. Then later, the priest said, as he wrote in his diary, that he had fictionalized the character of Irungu. Although Irungu was a real person, Ciar&aacute;n said he gave him the life he imagined he had. I wasn't sure if that was really Irungu's life as he was living it or if it was the fictionalized version that Ciar&aacute;n admitted to writing, especially since the majority of the book was written in first person in Ciar&aacute;n's voice. In spite of that, it is a novel well worth reading.

(RAW Rating: 3.5) - Finding Happiness Despite the Obstacles	Having survived a physically abusive marriage, Piper Alexander is left to face other harsh realities that her ex-husband left in his wake.  She feels and sees her life spinning out of control daily as she tries to hide a devastating secret and the resulting shame associated with it.  She sees her only option as never being happy again.  Facing a life of possible loneliness, she tries to cope in the only way she feels she can-contemplating suicide.  Only her closest friend, Andy Denoffrio, knows what she must confront daily and stands by her to help her keep a grip on sanity.<br /><br />Piper is a successful columnist for Woman Magazine in Chicago and Andy is her assistant.  With her boss breathing down her neck to produce a major expos&eacute; for the Christmas edition of Woman, Piper has to pull herself together and interview none other than the Irish television superstar, Alexander Maxwell.  Alexander has shied away from personal interviews during his career.  His only reason for agreeing to this one is because of his best friend, Joshua Callahan, who is a photographer at Woman.  Both Joshua's and Piper's careers are riding on this interview.  After a mix up, Piper walks away without the expos&eacute; they were looking for, but she does find a mutual attraction between the two of them.  His interest isn't something she wants at this moment.  It would mean having to tell him about her past, and that can never happen.  Alexander is smitten, and he wants to share it all with her, including the secret that has been plaguing him.<br /><br />DISARMING PIPER by T. E. Kendall is a very emotional roller coaster ride.  I found myself drifting from tears, to laughter, to outright whoops of joy, as Piper was able to navigate her way through the maze of pain, deceit and emotional obstacles to gain happiness.  Kendall has written an interesting storyline that she attacked with the tenacity of a pit bull.  The prologue was just as explosive as the rest of the book.  I would've loved to have seen more in-depth characterizations in a couple of the characters and a little more fine tuning in the editing department.

Enthralling	Eric Jerome Dickey has crafted a story based on secrets, deceit and redemption.  In GENEVIEVE, the story of a woman who has run from her past into a world of her own creation is told from her husband's perspective.  Genevieve left her family in Alabama when she was a teenager and never looked back.  She changed her name and recreated herself into a savvy and astute woman in the academic and financial worlds.  Her life seems to be going along as she planned until she receives a call from her grandfather telling her that her grandmother has died, summoning her back to her Odenville, Alabama roots.  The journey that Genevieve and her husband (who remains nameless throughout the novel) take will change their lives and make it impossible for them to view each other the same ever again.<br /><br />Dickey creates a layered story that enthralls you from page one.  He pulls you in immediately with a steamy love scene with a forbidden turn that commands you to read on.  He has created characters that are three-dimensional and complex.  Using language that is both descriptive yet simple, Dickey weaves a story that at times feels too detailed.  Therefore, patient readers will be satisfied and pleased with this novel and are rewarded with a surprise twist at the end.  GENEVIEVE is an engrossing read that showcases complex characters dealing with harsh situations.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Blurring the Color Lines	Somewhere between the harsh lines of black and white lie the inevitable shades of gray, as Laurie Gunst so adequately describes in her memoir, OFF-WHITE. Growing up in Richmond, Virginia, Gunst formed a strong bond with not only her nanny and caretaker Rhoda, but with all of the faces of color that shared her life.<br /><br />Already marked different because of being Jewish, Gunst felt her insides were different as well. In many ways, she saw herself as a white face with a black psyche due to her family's racially liberal ideals and her environment. She was the surrogate child of many African-Americans who were not only workers in her family's wealthy home, but also genuine adopted family members. She takes her readers on an identity pilgrimage throughout her childhood and adult years, adventures at Harvard and in Jamaica, and climaxing with the search for ancestors of both blood and spirit.<br /><br />While I thought OFF-WHITE started out a little slow, once I got to know the cast of characters in Laurie Gunst's life, I was smitten, intrigued, and enthralled with every last one of them. Gunst's writing is pensive and reminiscent without being too philosophical or academic. While the prose is certainly intelligently written, it was done so in a way that I felt she was telling me a story rather than relating mundane facts. Valuable lessons and awakenings abound in Laurie Gunst's memoir, and I am glad I got to know her and the people who touched her life.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
(RAW Rating: 4.5) - A Closer Walk With God	Looking at the description of A HEART OF DEVOTION by Tia McCollors was enough to get me excited about reviewing it. I was intrigued by the idea of a Christian Fiction novel that included the elements of drama and entertainment that many readers require. What I found in this book was a truly engaging and uplifting experience.<br /><br />After a year's hiatus from the dating game to strengthen his relationship with God, Tyson has finally allowed himself to feel for and become close to a woman. His girlfriend, Anisha, seems nearly perfect for him as she inspires, motivates, and supports his every endeavor. However, there are loose ends from Tyson's past that are threatening to strangle his newfound love, and when Anisha tries to focus on her own goals, they move in for the kill.<br /><br />Anisha's best friend, Sherri, prides herself on being a devout Christian and living by the Word. She is quick to judge and preach to others about their shortcomings, but temptation can be a powerful force. Sherri must learn to step back and take a look at her own life and decisions before judging those of others.<br /><br />Tia McCollors is a breath of fresh air in the Christian Fiction genre. She had me wrapped around her finger, wondering where things would end up, how the story would twist, and how the characters would grow. Never preachy, never unbelievably saintly, always human, and constant works in progress, her characters formed a bond with me that caused me to admire their resilience rather than scoff at their perfection. Humans aren't perfect, but this addition to the Christian Fiction genre nearly is. With her expertly woven novel, Tia McCollors has placed herself as one of my favorite authors in this genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13

It is of a time when people were at the height of power, intelligence, and beauty. A time when extraterrestrial beings from other galaxies, which Ms. Anderson believes are still hiding behind the clouds, visited the planet.

Their marriage, arranged when they were children, will unite the two territories and give Dumah absolute power. The wedding is planned for Aamina's nineteenth birthday. Months before the wedding Aamina shares an energy connection with King Daniy'el.

Aamina, yielding to her heart, slips away to Daniy'el's castle. Dumah is furious at their disrepect and plots to take a life and work a potion that will guarantee his marriage to Aamina. He stands to loose a kingdom if they do not marry.<br /><br />After ten years, Nichel Anderson accepts that she lived a former life, in another time. Influenced by several books on spiritual and intellectual journeys, she writes a mystical story filled with dreams that no longer frighten her. Ms. Anderson was compelled to open up her soul and reveal her journey through one of her many lifetimes; which highlight the mysteries of Ancient Egypt.

A fresh voice in fiction	Torrance Stephens has a very distinct style to his writing. At times, his prose almost seems like a lilting cadence; other times it's like a finely crafted speech, complete with pauses for applause. In his short story compilation ROCKSTAR, STUD, GIGILO, Stephens marries intelligent literary fiction with an element of grittiness and realism.<br /><br />My favorite piece in the collection was the first story, \\"Cutlass Daddies,\\" and, consequently, my favorite line was the first.<br /><br />\\"My castle was the city and my fort was the street.\\"<br /><br />This book abounds with funky fresh prose. I found myself marveling at both Stephens' poetic command of language and the fact that he is somewhat unsung; I hadn't read anything by him until this point. Other standout stories include \\"The Rockstar,\\" the story of a -- well -- rock star, \\"Reciprocity,\\" a short three page story that touches on platonic relationships, and \\"Wicked Ego Strokin',\\" the story that alludes to the adage that all is fair in love and war.<br /><br />While, at times, the various narrators in the collection seemed to have similar voices, I was still intrigued and elevated by them. I felt satisfied and enlightened by each of the stories; they were raw and different from the norm. Torrance Stephens not only thinks outside the box, he has stomped on it and left it lying on the concrete.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
Voice of Reason	If you've ever speculated about what happens to human beings once they cross over from the land of living, WHEN LOVE CALLS, YOU BETTER ANSWER might allow you to entertain one possibility. What if the ancestors who came (and left) before us were watching over our lives and guiding us to make the right decisions in life? While it may be a scary thought, especially to those of us with relatives who've passed on to Glory who weren't the type of people we want guiding us anywhere. Bertice Berry's characters in this novel soothe some of the fears, misgivings, and apprehension you might feel.<br /><br />While among the living, Aunt Babe was a loose woman looking for love in men who were incapable of giving it to her without a whole ball of string attached. She made a great many mistakes, dishonoring her family and herself. However, now that she's passed on to the other side, Babe is determined that her niece Bernita finds her path to happiness, even if she needs a guide from the other side.<br /><br />Filled with hilarious secondary characters and antics, hysterical commentary from Aunt Babe, and emotional circumstances, WHEN LOVE CALLS, YOU BETTER ANSWER is a book that has a little of everything needed to take the reader on a spiritual, comical, and emotional journey. Bertice Berry has mastered the art of conversational narrative; it was as though Aunt Babe was speaking directly to me. Life lessons abound in this little book, one of which is most definitely that when love calls, you'd better answer.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
Searching...	At one point or another, we can all relate to searching for something in life.  Whether we're searching for love, for self, or for understanding, the search never really ends.  In Bonnie Glover's debut novel, THE MIDDLE SISTER, she focuses on this search as she introduces us to characters who are on the journey to finding themselves and those around them.  We meet Pamela, her imaginary friend Kwai Chang, her two sisters, and her mother.  The story follows Pamela's growth from a young girl and the problems she encounters growing up after her father exits their lives.  We also are privy to the many changes on the surface of her life, such as her mother's depression and mental instability.<br /><br />Battling against the dilemmas of their young lives, they encounter many struggles caring for their mother, maintaining a household, and growing into women.  As they mature and start relationships outside of their family, they take one step closer to really understanding and seeing each other for who they are, accepting of their flaws, societal abnormalities, and past hurts.<br /><br />Shortly after beginning the novel, I felt it seemed a bit weird for an imaginary friend to be popping up -- mostly announced -- throughout the story.  Why would a young black girl in the projects choose to conjure up a Kung Fu character to guide her through the experiences of life?  It seems Kwai Chang served more as her conscience or as her advisor since her father was gone and her mother appeared to be mentally unstable.  In the vein of most contemporary books bordering on literary fiction, THE MIDDLE SISTER makes you think beyond the words, beyond what is actually being said.  At the end, I was left with the true meaning of family -- flaws and all -- and following one's own search for identity and the unconditional love of family.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Love at what cost?	Camille Roberts is determined that she will only marry for money. Love comes in a poor second for her in SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT by Niqui Stanhope. She has found a 57-year-old rich man who has asked her to marry him. He's not much in the love department, and he doesn't want any children, but she's willing to forego all that for the unlimited credit card he gave her while they were engaged and the thought of her life of leisure after they are married. Knowing what she'll be giving up and feeling the need for one last mad lovemaking session, she travels to Jamaica on her friend's private jet for a final fling. She is determined to find the most sexy, good-looking man for a one-night stand because she doesn't believe in being an unfaithful wife, even if her husband isn't interested in satisfying her physical needs. What she doesn't count on is falling head over heels for that one-night stand: a poor Jamaican hustler, or so she thinks. Just how important is money to her after all?<br /><br />This is an amusing romp through the fairy tale life of Camille Roberts. It is well written and definitely makes you want to visit Jamaica to see the island paradise for yourself. There are enough twists in the plot to keep if from becoming an ordinary romance story. At times the suspense gets a bit tense, forcing you to continue to turn those pages.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13

One determined woman, three handsome men, two longtime friends, an enemy that won't go away, a few \\"screaming orgasms,\\" the Kama Sutra, and a nude beach, all culminate in one spot-The Hot Spot.  And it's not just about the place on a woman's body that brings pleasure; it's a place where one woman finds her purpose and regains her strength.<br /><br />As long as one of Atlanta's high profile politicians can't keep his Johnson where it should be, Kendra Harrell, publicist extraordinaire, will always be in demand.  Though she's barely one step ahead of the bill collectors, chasing new clients at very every turn and trying like hell to keep her life together, recent events keep Kendra constantly in CMA (cover my ass) mode.  Adding to all that drama is a handsome chief of staff, a stalker ex-boyfriend and a hungry reporter who has come too close to the truth and is willing to steamroll over anyone to be the first to put the scandal into print.<br /><br />Hopefully, the latest series of fiascos will turn into a solid contract that will keep her above board, especially since Kendra's old boss and rival has suddenly closed in for the kill, aiming to crush Kendra's spirit and drive her out of business, if not out of the state.  What does a strong Black woman have to do to stay ahead?  Enter her best friends who have had her back since college.  Stephanie Ivey, the queen of engagement rings with a hefty stash to prove it, and Meg, a VIP event planner with a weakness for one man who has a special flaw of his own which may keep them away from the altar.  A chance invitation brings them all to a place that will be a turning point for some, but will definitely change their lives forever.<br /><br />THE HOT SPOT was a smoothly written piece that taps into the emotions as effortlessly as a knife slides into Red Velvet Cake.

Did it ever dawn on you that many times a man isn't really looking for sex? Rather, he just wants to know he can have it? These and other startling tidbits are revealed in the latest collection of interviews by Ursula Inga Kindred and Mirranda Guerin-Williams in their follow-up to Sister Gumbo. Women all over the planet will be stunned at the things revealed in this veritable handbook for getting and keeping a man.<br /><br />The authors interviewed several men of different ages, different backgrounds, and different marital experiences, providing readers with a wide range of answers. Though the subjects were primarily African-American, it seemed that many of the concepts could be applied to all men, regardless of race. Topics included commitment, pet peeves, sex, fatherhood, eroticism, dating, marriage, and everything in between. The interviewees were extremely candid, as some of the things they said were a shock and awe campaign on my senses.<br /><br />I must say that these ladies are a joy to read. They knew just the questions to ask and just how to ask them to provide us with the lowdown on how men really think. While the beginning introductions to the interviewees were a bit long, it was nice to have them there to refer to later in the book. I would suggest that if you get anxious, skim them in the beginning and go straight to the good part.

Friends or Lovers?	With SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT, Melanie Schuster has delivered an energectic<br /><br />family drama. Adam Cochran and Alicia Fuentes have been best friends since college. He is the yin to her yang in a purely platonic way. But life is rarely ever that simple between a man and a woman who are that close.<br /><br />After Adam's girlfriend and Alicia's fianc&eacute; were caught in a compromising position, Adam and Alicia rebounded and took their friendship to another level. Later, deciding friendship was more important than a relationship,  they toned down their emotions. For the last ten years they have shared a lucrative partnership with their architectural firm. But an annual community fundraiser, which features eligible bachelors to the highest bidder, stirs Alica's emotions, emotions that are more amourous than platonic. She may finally be bold enough to act on her feelings for Adam.<br /><br />Adam has always felt more for Alicia than friendship, he was merely respecting her wishes to just be friends; a position that is becoming increasingly hard to maintain. While planning how best to share his feelings with her his father drops a bomb on the family. The fallout alienates Adam  and sets him up to do something he adamantly opposes. But this may be just the incentive he and Alicia need to throw their 'friendship thing' out with the bath water, and finally follow their hearts.<br /><br />Melanie is relatively new in the Romance arena in terms of years being published; however, her writing is not an indication of this fact. She has blended powerful characters, caring families, believable drama, an element of scandal, and has produced some action packed moments. SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT is the sixth novel in this series and it still has readers anticipating how the family drama will play out. Good writing, great characterization, entertaining reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
How children survived an adult mess	In a land where family life was everything and the most fearsome thing was a prowling hyena or lion, fire suddenly exploded from the sky. THEY POURED FIRE ON US FROM THE SKY is the vivid description of the war in southern Sudan as seen through the eyes of three little boys, Benson, Benjamin and Alephonsion - who suddenly became homeless orphans and were forced to trek across Sudan to Kenya and Ethiopia without food or water. No longer having a father to frighten away the animals or a mother to prepare food, these five-year-old boys had to figure out how to survive. In addition to the horrors brought on by nature in the form of heat, no water, no food, hunting animals, biting snakes and insects, they soon discovered that people were not very nice to boys traveling alone. Frequently their food, clothing and blankets were taken from them or they were beaten and driven away. Even their own soldiers mistreated them and they found that after surviving so much and traveling so far, they were not exactly welcome in Kenya or Ethiopia. But survive they did to come to the United States to begin life anew.<br /><br />This gut-wrenching book is a real page-turner and I found myself unable to put it down, even when the stories brought tears and indescribable anger. It was a real eye-opener to read of United Nations aid gone astray as locals took the best for themselves and left the refugees starving. There were, of course, the good people who helped the refugees with food and transportation and even lost their jobs because of it. If you never believed that war could change ordinary people into selfish monsters, then this is the book for you. The book is well written, flows well, and the transitions are so smooth that sometimes I found myself going back to the beginning of the chapter to see which lost boy was telling this particular portion of the story. There were amusing sections such as when the boys were preparing to go the US and they were attempting to learn about flushing toilets. One of them didn't remember what the book instructions said and managed to flood the restroom at the airport terminal. The things we take for granted get a new life when viewed through these boys' eyes. I recommend this book for everyone in America.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersg toilets.

Finding Mr. Right	Shannon Grier, a lawyer, decides to try internet dating. Her co-worker, Matthew, gives her some rules about what to do and what not to do to keep herself safe and out of trouble. Shannon, after conversing with several men over the internet, decides to break the rules. She decides to engage in deception with a rather nice man that she has talked to on the telephone and eventually meets in person. To gauge his sincerity, she adopts another persona and engages Joseph in conversation. Not realizing that some of her other rule breaking is not as easily escaped, Shannon finds herself in a great deal of difficulty with some of the men she contacts both on and off the internet.<br /><br />THE WRITE1.COM is an interactive book with usable email addresses. We learn quite a bit about Shannon Grier's life through her emails, as well as the narrative. She is the sheltered daughter of very caring parents, but I found myself wondering how a thirty year old lawyer could possibly remain so disconnected from the larger world outside herself, her church and her parents. Perhaps Ms. Davis has made her a bit too naïve. Her father religiously calls her at 1 AM every morning just to make sure she is okay and both parents seem to want to keep her in a teenage mode forever. While Shannon is deeply religious and is certainly searching for a Christian man, her prayers get a bit repetitious. In my estimation, it would be enough for the reader to know that she prays without having to read every word of every prayer every time. In spite of this, the book does have suspense and would definitely interest a reader who is about to launch herself/himself into the world of internet dating.

After meeting Travis in a local bookstore, Mar&eacute; is caught up to the point she becomes obsessed over having him in her life.  He is attractive, articulate, listens well, and seems to actually care about what she has to say.  Immediately Mar&eacute; feels they are kindred spirits. Unfortunately for Travis, things will not turn out all rosy and sweet, because Mar&eacute; is a bit obsessive.  She has one thing on her mind and that's getting him at any cost, to him or those around him.<br /><br />Her whole personality changes as she plots behind closed doors.  She shuns her girlfriends, doesn't return their calls, or hang out as much as in the past, and her demeanor changes as she sneaks around setting plans in motion.  Those around her notice the differences, but are easily appeased by her lies and cover-ups.  And, as often as she can, Mar&eacute; is in the bookstore, looking for Travis on his normal Tuesday and Thursday after work stop.<br /><br />Written in first person with Atlanta as its backdrop, WON'T BE DENIED is a bit one-sided as the reader is only afforded the opportunity to see things from Mar&eacute;'s point of view.  Yet it was interesting to follow along her thought process and see her come to the conclusion about what she would do to ensure she wasn't denied the love she wanted.  Because of the dynamics of the story and how it was set-up, I really wanted to know more about some of the other characters, how they felt, and why they reacted (or didn't react) to certain things.<br /><br />The pace of the story was too slow initially, especially for a suspense and I found myself putting the book down, impatient because it was taking too long for the climax.  Once it actually happened, I became more involved in the story and questioned the actions of the protagonist. She definitely didn't have \\"it\\" all together and this book clearly showed that some people simply have no conscience.  They are willing to do whatever they must to have things the way they want them.  Sad, but a definite reality we face much too often in today's world.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Striving for Success	I haven't read an abundance of self-help books in my day; perhaps the reason I love fiction is because it allows me to immerse myself in the characters' problems and ignore my own. I selected to review RECIPE FOR SUCCESS on a whim because it sounded interesting and I figured it was worth a shot -- especially since we all have areas of our lives that can be improved.<br /><br />I've always been a bit of a packrat. I find it hard to let go of things for fear that I'll need them at a later date. Nevertheless, the clutter gets to me at times; it makes me feel anxious, nervous, or tired. Well, it turns out that one of Etuk's twenty-one indispensable things is to clear the clutter. I identified with nearly every sentence the author wrote, and it was somewhat of a wake-up call. I have since committed myself to clearing a little clutter every day.<br /><br />In addition to the section on organization, Etuk provides many other tips that I think anyone can use to improve habits, work, and life in general. For instance, time management, recordkeeping, taking time out for oneself, building a strong family base, gaining and maintaining spiritual health, and believing in oneself are all covered. Realistically, who can argue that these principles can improve a person's quality of life? In general, these are universal concepts. While Dr. Etuk employs many Christian Bible verses and quotes into his work, most of the principles and guidelines can be adapted to fit any religion or culture.<br /><br />Dr. Etuk's writing was concise and easy to digest, and the book was well-organized and nearly flawless in the editing department. If you had told me a month ago that I would be singing the praises of a self-help book, I might have told you to go sit down somewhere. However, I am inspired to delve into this genre a bit more, thanks to Dr. Emma S. Etuk.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
Boy meets girl	Valencia Hill, self-employed Bridal Consultant, plans the most fabulous weddings. At the wedding of a good friend of hers, she meets a fantastically handsome, professional athlete who shows a great deal of interest in her, but she can't be bothered. Two years ago at her own wedding, her groom-to-be stood her up at the altar and she has had nothing to do with men since. But there is something about baseball player, Michael Gomez that eventually gets through the tough armor she has erected to protect her fragile feelings. With much coaching from her friends, Valencia finally drops her guard and agrees to date Michael. Will she be able to lay her fears to rest and experience some of the marital joy she has arranged for so many others?<br /><br />In LOVE TO BEHOLD, Ms. Sammie Ward has constructed a boy-meets-girl, boy-marries-girl novella that shows how love can conquer all, even in women who have given up on men. The story was predictable from the beginning to the end and unfortunately, didn't generate much excitement. As uninviting as it may seem, a few glitches in the walk to the altar might have added that necessary tension that would have dragged the reader into the action. It's a nice, easy read for a snowy afternoon.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
Come Share My Pain	THE WORLD I ALWAYS KNEW takes readers on an intense, emotional voyage into the depths of the author's soul.  Frequented with passages of experiences we all may have endured, this book captures the turmoil, anguish and pain of a love forsaken, feelings of guilt and the reality of being abused.  With stand-alone titles such as Letting Go, Blindness see the Truth, and The Arriving, each one uniquely speaks for itself.<br /><br />Diamond Crystal Haynes writes with a voice that resonates with feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, grief and shame, but also challenges the readers to assess their own values and self-worth.  Although the book needs a little editing, the passion evoked from these poetic pieces have you wanting to reach out and help the author, reflect on your past failed relationships, face some truths and take a stand for the better.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
Changing horses	Camille has always preferred women. She experimented with a man once and had a child, Calvin, who is now a teenager. After having been hurt in love one too many times, she has sworn off relationships. That is, until she meets Billy on a beach. His smooth brown skin and handsome face entice her, and she succumbs to his charm. She suspects that he isn't what he says he is, but he's dynamite in the bedroom, so she overlooks it. Things get tense when her life starts to unravel as one jolt after another shocks her. Camille suddenly finds out what a small world she inhabits when she realizes that her teenage son and her lover's teenage son are friends and play on the same football team. Plus, without realizing it, she has become friends with Billy's wife, who has always referred to him as William. Camille has even chatted about Billy to his wife, Georgia, but neither knew he was the same man. In addition, she doesn't like the label \\"bisexual\\" which is applied to people like her. She prefers to think she is merely taking a sabbatical from women because she notices that she is still very much attracted to them.<br /><br />D.C. Johnson's A SLICE OF LIFE is a page-turner and is filled with suspense. You know, with all these people knowing each other without realizing they know each other, an explosion is about to happen and the tension keeps you turning those pages. Johnson has come up with more twists and turns than a corkscrew. And then there are the laugh-out-loud moments. It does remind us to listen to those small voices that tell us when something isn't quite right. I found the book to be very entertaining even if waiting to see how it would all turn out made me a little crazy as my imagination ran away with me. It was well-written and enjoyable.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
(RAW Rating: 4.5) - Listen to your heart	LOVE RUNS DEEP is an intense story about wasted love when individuals don't listen to their hearts. At the age of thirteen, Malcom Loring loved Jessica Ramsey; even then he wanted to share his life with her. Now 23 years later, his dream has flatlined, Malcom and Jessica are best buddies, and he is dating Jess's best friend. The irony is neither has been involved in a serious relationship; they are committed to their careers.<br /><br />Malcolm is the Sheriff of Codell County and is pleased with his life career wise, but is wondering where to take his personal life.

First, a trip to rescue his girlfriend reveals something he has ignored far too long. Second, when Jess is separated from him and her life is placed in danger, Mal looses his composure and is forced to reveal his true feelings. But has he wasted too much time?<br /><br />Geri Guilliaume has written a Contemporary Romance heightened with the drama of a natural disaster. She removes the facades and forces the characters to admit the inevitable. The message is that life is to be lived to the fullest, and love is too deep an emotion to be washed away by shallow waters. With solid characterization and a tight storyline, LOVE RUNS DEEP reads like more than a romance.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-13
A father's delight...	If you've never watched a father interact with his young daughter, you have missed a delightful treat.  There aren't many things as sweet as the love a father has for his daughter as he watches her in day-to-day activities.  The love returned from the daughter is almost one of adoration.  Such is the sentiment of Garrison Kellor's children's book DADDY'S GIRL.  In it, he shares four stories in which a father celebrates moments of quiet time, taking walks, dining, and dancing with his little girl.  The joy of fatherhood bounces off the pages and into the reader's heart.<br /><br />Robin Preiss Glasser's illustrations set this book off perfectly, with her depiction of the little girl in various poses of exuberance and the father glowing with pride.  I loved it!  Adding to the charm of this book is an accompanying CD which includes several of the stories/verses put to music that is catchy, a bit jazzy and fun to listen to and sing along with.  DADDY'S GIRL was a fun, delightful, and heart-warming read.  I look forward to sharing it with my husband and our daughter -- a definite Daddy's girl!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Empowering Others...Through Words	Frederick B. Covington has compiled a collection of sayings and teachings shared by African-American men ranging in age, social status, and beliefs in his first book, THEREFORE I AM: A Book for African-American Men. Broken into six main sections: Intelligence, Responsibility, Point of View, Character, Diligence, and Relationships, this book shares the lessons these men have learned through the words given to them in various parts of their lives.  One of the more well-known sayings is \\"to whom much is given, much is required\\" which states one should give back from which they've been blessed to help others, as a means of progress for everyone. Also included are teachings that children are influenced by what they see and being accountable for your actions, no matter how small they seem as they can affect someone else. These types of teachings, amongst others in this book and those passed down from parents and other relatives, if followed, will build up not only the reader, but also those they interact with.<br /><br />While this is a very good book and does a commendable job of keeping one focused in the right direction and informing men of their worth, their value, and the power they hold within themselves, I didn't necessarily see how it was specific to men. Most of the sayings I've grown up with myself and have also applied them to my life, so I don't think the collection is gender specific, but basically an inspiring and motivating guide in which anyone who chooses can use to empower themselves and those around them.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A few sex secrets...	SEX SECRETS FOR THE MARRIED WOMAN has one of the prettiest and inviting covers I've seen on a book, especially a self-help one.  After seeing it advertised online, I promptly ordered a copy, thinking it would be a book full of sex secrets and other hush-hush advice to help keep relationships on the upswing.  Deborah Smith has presented a few of her \\"secrets\\" in this short collection of what are basically sexual scenarios or what some would call role-playing.<br /><br />Is your husband working too much and forgetting about you?  Has the love-making become boring and repetitious?  Is there just not enough time with the kids underfoot, work, and other responsibilities?  Smith emphasizes that the other woman (aka wanna-be-mistress/hoochie/homewrecker) is out there waiting to lure away the husbands of married women, but she encourages wives to listen up and work to keep their men at home and in their marriage bed.  While I won't throw out the argument that men shouldn't cheat anyway, I will say that I get the point the author was trying to give.  No, I'm not going to share what the six secrets were, you have to read it yourself.  I will say that one in particular caught my eye, and I will definitely have to test it out.<br /><br />SEX SECRETS FOR THE MARRIED WOMAN has a nice, conversational, girlfriend-to-girlfriend tone, which I easily connected with, but it didn't seem to be more than a pamphlet or an article as it only included six \\"secrets.\\"  It is a nice step toward adding more spice to your love life and keeping things interesting, so yes, I would recommend it.  The concept is a good one, but I wish Ms. Smith had taken a bit more time to increase the amount of information given and to expound on it.  With additional editing and an expansion of the content, I'm sure this book could be much more of an impact to married women.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

How Much In A Day?	Being a high school graduate with no set direction is one thing, but after waking up one morning to find his parents gone, Ben can't seem to shake the nagging feeling that something terrible has happened.  Facing the astonishing realization that his parents mean the world to him and he can't imagine life without them, he sets out on a quest to find them.<br /><br />The streets of Miami are no joke, and although he already knew it, the reality and weight of the situation becomes even more pronounced.  After finding out disappointing information about members of his family who don't seem to care one way or another, he solicits help from his best friend Dre.  As if matters couldn't get any worse, Dre asks Ben to accompany him on a bank heist that he's not too sure about doing himself.  Feeling that he has to have his friend's back, Ben consents to this caper, and the two of them face consequences that not only alter their friendship, but their lives-forever.<br /><br />As Ben continues to search for his parents, he is thrown into the \\"real\\" world, full of good and evil, users, abusers and life as he never knew it.  He thought that turning to his ex-girlfriend and love of his life would be an option, but receives the shock of his life when she also turns her back.  What more could happen to him?

The price of success...	Monroe Goolynaburas is set on being the best chef in the world, but in order to do so, he must win the coveted title at a fair held in New York City annually.  He's a young chef and fairly new to the occupation, but he feels he's much better than some of his classmates who have become famous and have their own television shows and food items named after them.  Unfortunately for Monroe, during his first entry into the fair, he bases his recipe on tainted meat and is the laughing stock of the cooking industry.  He is determined to have a comeback and one day redeem himself in his culinary capabilities.<br /><br />Monroe's boss blames him for the demise in the status of his restaurant, Caf&eacute; Pacifica, once a well-known and well-attended establishment for those interested in fine foods.  When the opportunity presents itself for the restaurant to be able to enter the city fair again the next year, Monroe becomes obsessed in his quest for the perfect meat, untainted and pure, which he calls The Utopia.  He flashes back to being mentored by his culinary school teacher and upon finding The Utopia, he manages to create a simple, yet stunning masterpiece, though he only had three days in which to prepare.<br /><br />During the process, Monroe slips over the edge of stability.<br /><br />Finding out where he finds the perfect meat is one thing, but how he names his recipe, carries on conversations with it, and is convinced that it's his job to remove the impurities from those around him was a bit terrifying, and psychotic.  I found myself taking many deep breaths trying to remind myself the book was fiction, yet I never really stopped reading. Horrifying and unimaginable, MONROE'S REDEMPTION isn't a book I'll easily forget.  While I was repulsed at some of the character's actions, I found myself glued to the pages to find out exactly how far Monroe would go.<br /><br />As one seeks whatever their utopia is, they sometimes lose themselves in the process and cross many lines of right and wrong, never seeking the ramifications of their actions.  In MONROE'S REDEMPTION, though we see a man who merely wanted to quantify his skills, we also see someone who became a monster in the process, turning into that which he was opposed to in the beginning.

Seasons Change	When the mother of Promise's daughter is brutally murdered, he steps up to the plate and begins raising his daughter on his own. Life as a single dad isn't easy, but he adjusts to the routine of caring for his daughter and creating a family for them.  His only problem is the way he makes money.  He and his partners Squeeze, Show and Pooh have been friends since childhood and now they are in business together.  Rather than hustling drugs or women, their crew hustles the hustlers - robbing them of their illegal goods and money.  The life of crime brings easy money, but it also involves risks and with a 3-year-old depending on him, Promise must reevaluate how he's living.  In STREETS OF NEW YORK, the three authors introduce us to a group of memorable characters, all of whom, like Promise, are at a crossroads.<br /><br />Each of the authors told parts of the story through the eyes of different characters.  \\"Wild Side\\" by Erick Gray is told from Promise's point of view.  In it, readers are privy to his inner thoughts and issues regarding his lifestyle.  In \\"Ride or Die Chick\\" Mark Anthony continues Promise's story, but tells it from the point of view of his girlfriend.  The transition between these two stories was well executed; you could hardly tell there were two different writers.  Finally, Anthony Whyte's contribution, \\"One Block to Go\\" gives readers a deeper look at Pooh.  Whyte shifts between past and present in a series of flashbacks and, while the transition was a bit rocky at times, he did a good job outlining the how and why behind the man that Pooh became.  As the book ends, you can't help but wonder what will happen in the sequel.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed STREETS OF NEW YORK.  While it focused on criminal lifestyles, it still did a good job depicting the downside to easy money.  The book was never preachy and the characters were interesting and multi-dimensional.  Through their struggles, it is apparent that even though the money was good, they all had to pay a price to live as they did.  The book had a few editing issues, but not to the point that they were a constant distraction.  I was particularly impressed by how well each of the author's contributions fit so well together; it was like reading a novel.  This is a gritty, hard-hitting tale that shows the true consequences of life on the streets.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewershad to pay a price to live as they did.

Keepin' It Real	What keeps young people away from the church?  What can be done to draw them in?  Why would young people want to go to church anyway?  These are but a few of the questions Mykel Mitchell addresses in his book WORD: For Everybody Who Thought Christianity Was for Suckas.  Using his own life as an example, he shares his experiences in a vivid and honest manner.<br /><br />He begins by explaining why he was turned off by churches and religion and then candidly explains the sense of despair and lack of fulfillment that led him to give it another try.  He reflects on how his professional success, material goods and hip-hop lifestyle were not enough to provide a true sense of fulfillment.  He reminisces about his journey back to Christianity and the struggles he encountered while trying to be not only a better Christian, but a better man.  From there he goes on to discuss various issues such as sex, money, marriage, and forgiveness, all from the Christian perspective.  Most importantly he notes, that while he has changed in many respects, he hasn't rejected his hip-hop style.<br /><br />I can't express what a gem this book is.  It is great for churches trying to build or enhance youth ministries because it highlights some of the reasons why some young people are difficult to engage.  The book uses everyday language and hip-hop slang to explain some of the basic tenants of Christianity.  As a result, it is a book young people can enjoy and relate to.  This can be used to expose non-Christian teens and young adults to the faith and would also be a wonderful discussion tool for Sunday School classes and youth groups.  Mitchell points out that commitment to God doesn't mean giving up having fun and being hip, but it offers the added security of knowing that God is working in your life and has your back.  I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-04

This story reaches out, pulls you in, and helps you see the imperfections and mistakes we all have and make.  There is the realization that we can fix those things, affecting not only ourselves, but those around us.

The Reality of Sisterhood	THERE WAS A SPIRIT is a poignant portrayal of college life during the early 1970's.  It focuses on the unique experiences of African-Americans attending a primarily white university during a period of political and racial upheaval.  The story begins in the early part of the century when racial dynamics were even more intense and even life threatening.  Readers are introduced to Sadie Mae, one of the founding members of Omega Pi Alpha Sorority.  Her story is an attention grabber, and it immediately draws you into the book.  However, to discover Sadie's full story, readers must first move ahead several decades and meet Najwa Jackson, the main character.<br /><br />Najwa Jackson is attending Casperton University, and is a proud member of Omega Pi Alpha Sorority.  She has big plans for her senior year of college, particularly as it relates to the sorority because she has been elected chapter president.  While on the surface she seems to have everything together, she deals with insecurity, loneliness and uncertainty about her future.  As the story progresses, we meet her friends, family and associates, get a taste of Black Greek life, and a glimpse of political issues such as abortion and racism. Najwa's penchant for history her desire to learn more about Sadie's life and role as co-founder of the sorority, result in the discovery of a much more complete view of Sadie's life.  What she unearths rocks the university to its very core.<br /><br />Kimberly Noelle has ambitiously taken a coming of age story and integrated past and present events while addressing relevant social and cultural issues.  Because there were so many layers to the story, there were times when I found myself wondering how it would all fit together.  The author immediately piqued my interest in Sadie's story, but then shifts and focuses on Najwa.

Be True to Self	PICTURE ME ROLLIN' is a candid snapshot into the gritty tale of Esperanza Cepeda, an ex-con who goes down for the sake of having her boyfriend Jesus' back.  As luck would have it, although she's only been gone a year, Jesus has been doing other things with other women, as well as spending the same money she got busted for.  Sometimes, we have to learn the hard way.<br /><br />With a probation officer scrutinizing her every move and a sister who has given up the street life, Esperanza realizes she needs to find truth in herself and live life the honest way.  Deciding to get her high school diploma, she meets Maite Rodriguez, a teacher who not only understands what she has been through, but also helps her define the potential she holds to do something better. Things get a little sticky when Esperanza can't get away from Jesus, as he wants her to do one \\"last\\" job with him.  Finally realizing that the only person she owes loyalty to is herself, Esperanza reclaims the life that was once taken.<br /><br />Black Artemis does an excellent job with this story, providing a picturesque view of street life and the effects it has on young people.  The characters are fresh, intense and provide a hauntingly close reality of an environment all too familiar to some.  With constant references to Tupac Shakur, a lyrical genius, PICTURE ME ROLLIN' is filled with poetry that parallels life.  A deep, thought-provoking novel, this story is sure to keep you wanting more.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-08-04
Gritty tale of street life and bad cops	In BRAZEN, the debut title of Mo Shines, the reader is presented with an urban tale of street life and the twisted minds of police officers entrusted to protect and defend.  On the surface and to other police officers, Detective Jay Robinson is the model cop with a successful career to his credit, but upon closer inspection, he's not so great.  Jay is fed up with the low pay and more than annoyed that drug dealers are living a better life than he is, so he's switched sides of the playing field.  Though he still wears the NYPD uniform, he shakes down drug dealers, commits murder, and plants evidence as necessary to ensure his financial status, with plans to eventually retire and live luxuriously from his dirty money.<br /><br />Sean Coleman is an undercover Internal Affairs investigator brought in as Jay's new partner to bring down Jay and his previous partner, Warren.  Sean works to embed himself in their world -- gaining trust and learning more about their operation.  Unfortunately, to do this he must be privy to and part of some of the horrific acts performed by Jay and his former partner and later learns of other heists and crimes committed by the two.  As he deals with his undercover status and his moral obligations, he is also struggling through  changes in his marriage.  He's not at liberty to discuss his new position with his wife and is left to swim in his own thoughts of helplessness.  During this time, they grow apart from one another and his wife drifts away from him and into the arms of another man.  This act of betrayal, once discovered, shatters Sean's world, disrupts his balance between right and wrong, and causes him to lose everything -- all for revenge.<br /><br />While the first portion of the book moved a bit slow for me and the book could use a good proofreading, I enjoyed the plot.  The battle Sean fought to keep control of his pledge to society, and the subplot dealing with his relationship with his wife was intriguing.  It definitely makes you think, and just as you're sure you have the book figured out, the author adds in a twist, which completely throws you off guard, but thrills you at the same time.  I was intrigued by the storyline of BRAZEN and am glad to see a different twist to the many street fiction type of novels on the market.  Mo Shines has written a gritty expose' that reads like a movie.  It is one of those books you can see while reading. Those who like action-packed, suspenseful movies with explosions, street life, or even readers of crime thrillers will enjoy this title.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Opportunity Knocks	Juanita Lewis and many of her friends from Dancing on the Edge of the Roof return in the sequel, ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A DREAM.  Despite the fact that this book is a sequel, the author provides enough background so the book can stand alone.  However, having read the first book, I think I had a better understanding of Juanita's history, which enhanced my reading experience.  Juanita decided one day that she had had enough of her unfulfilled life, packed up and eventually found herself in Paper Moon, Montana.  While in Paper Moon, she made new (very zany) friends, found romance, and really began to love and appreciate herself.<br /><br />As the story opens, Juanita is riding off with her friend Peaches, a young, lesbian truck driver, to see the West Coast for the very first time.  As she continues to think about what her future holds, Juanita struggles with feelings of self-doubt and insecurity.  She hopes and prays that things will come together for her.  Well, she soon learns to be careful what she wishes for.  As job offers, educational opportunities, and a surprise inheritance emerge, she feels a bit overwhelmed.  And just when she thinks she can't possibly deal with any more, drama from her family and the past she left behind emerge.  As she navigates this journey, Juanita soon discovers and relates to readers that there are times in life for questions, times for answers, and sometimes answers just lead to more questions.<br /><br />Sheila Williams has written a thoughtfully crafted tale about a middle-aged woman's continued journey to self-discovery.  Through Juanita's character, readers are reminded that everyone has fears and doubts, and that life is indeed a constantly evolving process.  I loved being privy to Juanita's inner dialogue and her sarcastic wit.  The only shortfall with this book was it's pacing, which at times was a little too slow for my tastes.  ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A DREAM is a mature read, and one that I really enjoyed.

In My Father's Kingdom	Tamara Britton has a special place in her heart for foster children, or so she thought.  As an employee of the Care for Kids Agency, her job is to train foster parents and provide services to stabilize families to prevent children from being removed from their homes.  In PLENTY GOOD ROOM by Cheri Paris Edwards, Tamara finds herself in an awkward situation; she accepts the temporary responsibility of bringing a teenage runaway into her home.  With this assignment, Tamara is forced to deal with the interruption of everything she finds calming in her life.<br /><br />Sienna is the smart mouth, teeth sucking, neck snapping, brazen teenager forced to share living quarters with Tamara.  Because Sienna did not choose her living arrangement and Tamara believes she was coerced into accepting Sienna into her home, what occurs are temper tantrums and all out war on the home front.  Sienna does poorly in school simply because of her behavior, and she has a difficult time following the rules of Tamara's household.  It is not until Sienna meets up with the children of another foster family, attends church and joins the choir that her behavior becomes manageable.  The question remains, will it last?  This question is always on the minds of Tamara's outspoken coworkers as they bounce around their own brand of discipline.  Because of her passive personality, her coworkers add a humorous element to the overall story, humor that keeps Tamara sane when needed and vocal when required.<br /><br />While an interesting and well-written read, what I found annoying was the constant emphasis on Sienna's gestures, i.e., the clucking of her tongue.  I realize the author was attempting to draw a picture of Sienna, with her gestures and mannerisms, but this reference was constant. She does however tantalize the story with alternating chapters of Tamara's daily life with Sienna and the life of an unknown teenage runaway.  Also included is Tamara's search for a friend's biological family, which adds a shroud of mystery to the story. An education into the inner workings of a foster care agency is enlightening and the struggles, hopes and dreams that often elude children of the street are showcased.  All of this is coupled with Christian based themes of finding and sustaining faith and forgiveness, which make for an effective analysis of where we are in life and where we want to be.  This is the author's first literary effort, one, which is filled with biblical lessons for all, and one where the author knows the subject matter.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

He Makes Me Feel Brand New	Former child prodigy and renowned scientist Claire Scott is smarter than most of the world's inhabitants and she does not have a problem letting others know.  Currently developing a cure for ovarian cancer, Claire is reunited with foes from high school and a friend who has something to hide in THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL by Tamara Sneed.<br /><br />Raised by her older sister and father, Claire began high school at age eleven and was always fascinated with the sciences.  This love sent her to Harvard and subsequently MIT, and she has won rave reviews for her work.  Settling outside of Los Angeles, she only has time for her research and her immediate family.  Unbeknownst to her, a chance encounter puts her in the midst of a bet with player Duncan Hillston and danger with her girlfriend Annabelle.<br /><br />Claire was dubbed Medusa in school because of her age, bookworm appearance and her knowledge of science.  Because of Duncan's tales of pummeling the opposite sex, his goal is to get Claire to fall in love with him and win the trip of his dreams.  If he fails, he must admit to his friends, who have suffered years of listening to his tales, he is a first-rate liar at an upcoming block party.  Duncan has two weeks to achieve this feat.<br /><br />An interesting and daring story, THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL has fully developed characters, and through their musings we are able to capture their ups and downs of the past and the present.  Sneed has included important family members, who matter, to further develop the characterizations.  Other characters add the right element to this story with their humor and their strangeness.  At times the plot is implausible however, the story is filled with intrigue, where rules are made to be broken.

Here We Go Again	Toni T. Goodwin can't get around the lie that she's carrying.  Or can she?  Already engaged to handsome, smart and wealthy John Collins, she feels that she's the luckiest girl in the world.  Everyone who is privy to her little secret constantly give her the best advice: come clean with John or this entire thing will blow up in your face.<br /><br />Although Toni would love nothing better than to be honest with John, she just can't seem to find the time to tell him the truth.  Or, could it be her flashbacks of the last time she tried to be honest with a man?  Was it the fact that she ended up in the hospital that's giving her reservations?  No matter what, the truth is bound to come out, one way or another.<br /><br />As the engagement party and wedding draws nearer, Toni is faced with the inevitable.  There are people who have figured out her secret, and she's pushed up against the wall.  To make matters worse, the same person who put her in the hospital the first time is an old friend of John's, and is invited to the engagement party and the wedding.  It's time for Toni to make a decision.  Her intentions are true; aren't they?<br /><br />HALLEMA does it again with part two of this trilogy, which overall, is a good story and quick read.  The only thing that's a noticeable flaw is the fact that almost the entire ending from the first book was put into the second.  But, if you haven't read the first one, it will definitely bring you up to speed.  Toni T. Goodwin and the other characters are still full of fun and hilarious antics, and it definitely leaves you waiting for the third installment of this trilogy - Toni's not the only one with secrets.  If you want a good laugh, you won't be disappointed.  TRUE INTENTIONS is sure to lift your spirits.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewers	2005-08-04
Can You Hear The Beat?	Imagine a spoken word to the tune of a musical jazz selection.  Can you hear the wail of the sax?  Can you feel the tempo and rhythm as it calibrates into sensations of smooth poetry, floating off your ears?  Kamau Da&aacute;ood transcends reason with his version of this popular language, guiding us as he uses metaphors and melodies to describe THE LANGUAGE OF SAXOPHONES.<br /><br />A powerful collection, broken into sections ranging from 1970 through 2004, Da&aacute;ood takes us on a dance with him, revisiting each era, sharing his insights.  Vivid images come to mind as the poems are read, reflecting on his artistic nature.  Woven like an intricate web, he chronicles his anger against racism and injustices, while at the same time, allows us to witness his influence on others.  Like a sensuous dance, the poems go up and down, seemingly getting better as they progress, allowing the reader to  hold onto a piece of time in the process.<br /><br />Poetry cannot be explained, as it is revealed within the voice of the poet.  Although the poems did get better as they progressed, some of the poems featured were as if they were being modeled specifically from a musical standpoint, which might confuse some readers, especially if they don't have any musical background.  A little raw around the edges, this book is definitely one that caters to the spoken word crowd.  If you're not deeply embedded within this realm of the poetic culture, it might not be the book for you, but if you are, you've just stumbled across quite a gem.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewers	2005-08-04

Deciding to take some control, she does the unthinkable and allows him back into her life.  Sometimes, we don't learn from our mistakes and have to take that train ride again.<br /><br />Michael realizes that he married someone he wasn't in love with and can't help but look for love elsewhere.  He finds it in Jasmine, but ends up losing her because of his own dishonesty.  Time waits for no one, and although he wants to right his wrong, he ends up hurting everyone else - including himself.<br /><br />Lisa is Jasmine's best friend and constant advocate since elementary school.  She loves her to pieces, but can't seem to stay out of Jasmine's business.  Always running her mouth in the wrong places, it finally catches up to her.  Although she means well by meddling, she has to face the one thing that she's responsible for: her own deception.<br /><br />Allen is a best friend to Lisa's boyfriend, but can't work miracles.  Being caught in the middle of a web of secrets, he realizes that he has his own inner demons to work out.  On top of that, he's in love with Jasmine, but doesn't want to let her know.  With built-in baby's mama drama, Mr. Allen has his hands full.<br /><br />SECRETS was filled with lies, deception and distrust.  Although the storyline could have had some merit, there were too many things going on at one time and too many characters involved in the mix.  This novel was also overshadowed by the constant typographical, stylistic and grammatical errors.  With an editor and some reconstruction, this novel could possibly be a good read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewers	2005-08-04
Witty and engaging...	PASSPORT DIARIES is the debut title of author Tamara T. Gregory, a movie producer known for her work on the films Brown Sugar, The Rock, and Celtic Pride.  PASSPORT DIARIES chronicles the travels of Kia Carson during one of the most vulnerable times of her life.  Kia is an extreme shoe lover and also the prosecuting attorney with the District Attorney's office, known for not going for the jugular in cases in which it isn't warranted.  However, her boss disagrees and suspends her after her latest case.  For Kia, it isn't too bad since her suspension parallels the time she has planned to take a vacation.<br /><br />Not able to convince any of her family or friends to join her, Kia, after being cajoled by Drew, a white coworker, decides to take her European trip solo.  Her itinerary includes London, Paris, and Greece.  Before she even leaves Los Angeles, she becomes overwhelmed with her emotions and her seating assignment. She locates her seat, the one towards the back of the plane, cramped between an obese man and a woman with a screaming baby. This sends tears flying and Kia tries to abandon her vacation, however a helpful flight attendant directs her to first class, comforts her, and later in the story challenges her to totally enjoy her trip abroad, doing at least one thing in each new place that she wouldn't normally do.  Kia takes her up on the offer, getting involved with an experimenting couple, going on a date with an irresistible Frenchman, and then on the last leg of her trip, she decides to bare it all on the beach.  With each stop on her trip, she learns more about herself, life, her coworkers, and about her relationships with her booty-call-stand-in.  She becomes in tune with her body and the realization that she wants love and to be loved.  As love stares her in the face, she has to balance preconceived notions against her feelings, and decide once and for all what she wants.<br /><br />Please don't be fooled by the book's title, as I was when I selected it to read.  The book is so much more than what the term diary implicates.  PASSPORT DIARIES is an in-depth look towards discovering self.  Gregory's writing is witty, fast-paced, and emotional.

Black Hair	If I have heard it once, I have heard it a thousand times: black people have a special relationship with their hair.  In CUTTIN' UP, Craig Marberry has put together a collection of interesting vignettes that highlight black barber shops around the nation.  The stories introduce us to all kinds of people, some barbers, some patrons, some famous, and some lesser known. Each passage includes relevant photographs, usually of the narrator.  The book covers a myriad of issues and topics including haircuts as a rite of passage, civil rights and the barber shop, barber shop camaraderie, funny stories and superstitions.  Some stories are humorous, others are sad and all are educational.<br /><br />Marberry has put together a well-organized collection that will remind readers that the ordinary things in life like going to the barber shop for a shape up can have a meaningful impact on one's life.  This is a book you can pick up again and again and find at least one or two passages that will speak to you.  By sharing stories told by an assortment of contributors, the author highlights our cultural diversity.  The accompanying photographs make the stories even more personal and some of them are worth a second, more thoughtful look on the basis of their pure artistry alone.  CUTTIN' UP didn't move emotional mountains for me, but the passages did make me smile and leave me with a sense of warmth.

Poems of tribute	Ira E. Harrison shares poems of tribute to the many women who have passed through his life in his collection B.A.A.D: Beautiful African American Daughters.  Starting with the letter A he goes through the alphabet and provides a poem to represent a woman he has known in his childhood, at work, or through his involvement in church and the community.  He ends with the letter Z using a poem for \\"Zelma\\" and the summation, a poem entitled \\"BAAD.\\"<br /><br />B.A.A.D: Beautiful African American Daughters is direct in its approach for most of the pieces, but at times the subtleness and hidden meanings in the pieces are quite interesting.  The author supports his mission of celebrating women and offering a tribute as he shares their impact on his life.  He employs an intermediate style of writing--simplistic and honest.  Though the diction and voice is a bit flat throughout some of the pieces and a lot are short and choppy, some of them are actually powerful when viewed individually.  I really enjoyed \\"Visit Over\\" which hints of his loneliness when a woman left or ended a relationship.  Other favorites include \\"Souvenirs\\" and \\"Stampede\\" which are more rhythmic and resonate with the poet's feelings.<br /><br />Collectively and bound as a book, I'm not so sure the average poetry lover will be moved by B.A.A.D.  Unfortunately,  for me it was too simplistic and too specifically geared toward the women mentioned -- not necessarily intended for the general public.  Those poems I enjoyed most were more focused on the emotions of the author and not necessarily the specific woman identified.  For those family members and friends of Harrison who are familiar with the women, the pieces may have more of an impact, as they too may be privy to some of the thoughts shared by Harrison.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Living Without Fear	Have you ever felt like your present life was nothing like you'd dreamed it would be?  Well, in MASTERING ABUNDANCE, psychic Nzingha Moses suggests that much of our disappointment about life can be attributed to our own fear and limited thinking.  She also talks at great length about how karma plays a role in our life.  In addition to providing case examples, the author incorporates her own experiences and journey to a deeper level of spirituality.<br /><br />This is a book that will inspire self-reflection.  For clarification, this isn't a book about Christianity; it focuses more on spirituality.  Moses does a good job demonstrating the connection between our behavior today and the past hurts we have experienced.  The book also inspires readers not to settle for second best, but rather to think big and set high expectations.  The discussion about the problems many encounter in relationships was also quite interesting.  Her suggestion to love yourself foremost and then look for a significant other is a pearl of wisdom that isn't new, but definitely bears repeating.<br /><br />The real-life examples used in the book were an excellent addition and provided context for some of the points outlined in the book.  However, some of the points were supported by rather circular reasoning and the book got a little preachy at times.  Where the book falters for me most is in the \\"how-to\\" aspect, where it seemed as if the author oversimplified things.  If you have been crippled by fear for most of your life because of some early childhood experience, it seems a little elementary to just say \\"change your thinking\\" and expect for change to occur.  If you are ready for a change then MASTERING ABUNDANCE may provide just the inspiration. (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-04
And Then There Was Joshua Michael	Joshua Peeler and Sarah Edwards are two sixteen-year old students navigating and planning their futures in the Bronx.  Beginning in 1972, THE JOSHUA TREE by L. Steven Rencher spans over twenty-five years to tell their story, a story that encompasses the likes of their friends, foes, children and grandchildren.<br /><br />In a dream, Joshua meets a girl named Sarah.  During a daily romp, his dream is realized and according to him, it is fate.  But to Sarah it is a way out of her daily life, an existence with the likes of a mentally abusive father.  She is smart and has goals, which include leaving the projects for college, never to return.  Joshua is the son of a divorced mother of four and a devout Christian.  He also has dreams of attending college and becoming an architect.  As they traverse the streets of New York to be together, a horrible event occurs, unbeknownst to Joshua, which drastically changes Sarah's mental stability.<br /><br />Sarah and Joshua grow from teenagers into adulthood as each chapter takes you closer and closer into the mind of Sarah and her inability to love her eldest son and her ability to blame everyone for the hand life has dealt her. Sarah constantly muses with the fact that her life should have been different, yet she does nothing to change the outcome. Each chapter also highlights the strength of Joshua as the attentive and committed husband and his steadfastness to hold his family together regardless of the consequences.  A set of tragic events occur over the course of twenty-five years and more, which eventually takes Sarah back to the day she met Joshua. Like a transformation or rebirth, Sarah is forced to realize the role he played in her life.<br /><br />The author's attention to detail intertwines the use of many literary elements.  Occasionally, his use of metaphors is long and tedious and veers off into a tangent, allowing for an awkward and laborious read.  With a skilled hand, his use of imagery assists in visualizing the sight, sound and feel of New York and all of the characters depicted.  He incorporates detail into each and every character, and each character has a function that is captured within the story of Joshua and Sarah.  THE JOSHUA TREE is a classic tale of living and overcoming social ills, fate, faith and the restoration of love.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

The Things Kids Say...	Many moms know the ups, downs, laughter and joy involved in having and raising children. From the first moment she holds them, through the first steps, and to the first rebellious act, comes various emotions. Author TJ Dupree has shared many of her special moments with her children in CONVERSATIONS WITH MOM. As a first-time mom, I really enjoyed the stories in this book as I can easily relate to a lot of them.<br /><br />My favorites were the ones revolving around kids imitating adults (they do love to use our words against us), potty training (oh the horrors), and family time (the precious moments). One of the funniest stories in this collection was when the family was out to a restaurant with slow service and the son looked around and in a very loud voice said, \\"What does a Black brother have to do to get some service?\\" While maybe not politically correct, that is just hilarious! And yes, they were served shortly afterwards.<br /><br />While there were some really touching stories, I wish the book could've been longer as it seemed to end abruptly with the closing of the last story. It would've also been nice to see more of a range of memories from the various stages children go through. I did, however, enjoy reading CONVERSATIONS WITH MOM and would encourage others to check it out, especially those with children or expecting. It is a feel good book which will help parents recall memories of their own.  (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-04
New Beginnings	The senior year of college is a challenging period in the lives of young adults.  They must juggle the demands of the classroom, hunt for post graduation employment, say goodbye to friends and embark on yet another stage of adult life.  As Clark enters her senior year at Hampton University, she has her job lined up and intends to enjoy her last year of college to the fullest.  When she meets Devin, an underclassman, she is hesitant to trust him and pursue a relationship but is immediately swept off her feet.  Over time their relationship grows and the two begin to make plans for how their relationship will proceed once she graduates.  The couple maintains their long distance love and everything is smooth sailing.  That is, until Devin's graduation approaches and Clark must give up her job in Maryland and relocate to New York while he attends law school...this is when the true drama begins.<br /><br />When you are caught up in all that life dishes you and trying to plot out plans for adulthood, difficulties are sure to arise.  This is true for Clark and Devin and in addition, they are both plagued by insecurities that are not uncommon, especially in long distance relationships.  As crises emerge and secrets are revealed, there is more and more tension in the relationship.  Will the couple be able to withstand the pressures?  Does love REALLY conquer all?  When is enough, enough?  When is it time to let go?<br /><br />Candice Dow's novel was quite enjoyable.  Her characters were well-rounded and each of them had obvious strengths and obvious flaws.  By focusing on the often overlooked stage of life that immediately following college graduation, she added an air of originality that makes CAUGHT IN THE MIX stand out.  Unlike a lot of relationship books which focus on the misdeeds of men, Dow provides balance.  There were times when I felt Devin was the best man in the world and others when I thought he was a dog.  The same feelings were true of Clark and many of the secondary characters, whose stories enhanced the overall plot.  The author begins the story in the present with a dramatic scene.

Life Without Fear	Ever wondered what it takes for a person to walk among a den of snakes without fear?  While this is a philosophical question, it is in essence the theme of J. Everett Prewitt's freshman novel, SNAKE WALKERS.  The book opens with a harrowing scene in which a young Anthony witnesses the lynching of a boy about his age.  Not only was the crime unsolved, but was never mentioned in local newspapers or neighborhood gossip.  The nameless victim of this horrendous crime haunts Anthony, he suffers from nightmares, anxiety attacks and intense fear. In spite of his father's misgivings, he vows to become a journalist so that he can be a voice for the voiceless victims of senseless crimes.<br /><br />By 1962, Anthony has completed his college education, but is sheltered and naïve.  His limited understanding of racial dynamics, issues of civil rights and even familial relationships all come into play as the story unfolds.  After a long, frustrating job search, he finally gets a position at a small southern newspaper and eventually gets his \\"big break.\\"  This break is the opportunity to investigate various racial crimes and create a series of articles covering them for the paper.  While investigating his first lead, he discovers a town that has been completely abandoned.  In an attempt to find answers, he goes digging for information and soon realizes all of his leads point to the Coulters and the Williams families.  As Anthony continues his journey to the big story, he learns that nothing is as it seems and is forced to re-examine his personal life and views.<br /><br />SNAKE WALKERS is a dynamic work of fiction with a slow, deliberate pace that is reminiscent of Southern Life.  The characters are well developed, colorful, flawed and each of them is transformed in the course of the story.  The plot is full of twists and suspense; this adds an additional layer of richness to an already compelling work of historical fiction.  Prewitt's use of language was impressive and so full of detail that I could \\"see\\" the landscape, \\"hear\\" the screeching tires, and \\"feel\\" the clammy hands and surges of adrenalin.  In addition to writing a story that is enjoyable, he has created a tale that explores history, civil rights, identity, family, and community; it was simply a delight to read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersll of detail that I could \\"see\\" the landscape, \\"hear\\" the screeching tires, and \\"feel\\" the clammy hands and surges of adrenalin.

The Road to Freedom	In Bebe Moore Campbell's latest literary offering, 72 HOUR HOLD, readers are taken into the lives of Keri and her daughter Trina.  All her life, Trina has been a source of pride and joy for her mother.  A straight-A student, with SAT scores nearly off the charts, Keri couldn't be more pleased with her daughter.  After graduating from high school and being accepted at a prestigious university, Trina was heading for the fast-track to a successful life.  But then her behavior became more and more erratic, and then it went from erratic to violent and eventually Keri had no choice but to have her daughter admitted to the hospital.  With a diagnosis of bi-polar disorder, a pseudo-cocktail of prescription drugs, and therapy sessions, Trina's life suddenly and drastically changes.  No longer are Keri and Trina preparing for her freshman year in college, instead they are consumed by the daily struggle to help Trina regain a somewhat normal life. This is complicated by Trina's non-compliance in taking her medications and her attempts to self medicate through the use of marijuana and alcohol.<br /><br />While Trina's mental illness is central to the plot of the book, the real emphasis is on Keri and her role as a mother.  She tries as much as possible to hide Trina's illness and struggles to suppress her sense of shame and the envy she feels for her friends with children who are moving on with their lives.  She deals with self-doubt and blames herself for her daughter's behavior.  Keri is emotionally and socially withdrawn and is so consumed by putting out her daughter's fires that somewhere, she loses herself.  As the story progresses we are privy to her daily struggles, her joys and sorrows, and most of all, her fears.  We follow her on a journey on which she must learn the true meaning of unconditional love.<br /><br />Bebe Moore Campbell is a consummate writer.  Her use of language and metaphor was at times breathtaking and often led me to re-read certain passages just out of sheer enjoyment.  The analogy she posed throughout the book comparing Keri's role as a parent of a child with mental illness to Harriet Tubman's role as conductor of the Underground Railroad was poignant and heartfelt.  The top-notch character development and interesting plot brought an added richness to the story that made Keri's struggles with her daughter more real and more in-your-face.  In addition to being a well-written book, 72 HOUR HOLD is important because of its focus on the relevant social and emotional issues surrounding mental illness -- a problem that will not disappear. Bebe Moore Campbell's almost literary style makes for a story that is timeless; as such, this book is sure to become a classic.<br /><br />(RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersout of sheer enjoyment.

My Silver Dollar	Lanita Lightfoot Powers is a thirty-eight year old married mother of one, embarking on life by finally graduating from college in JUST MY LUCK by Tajuana \\"TJ\\" Butler.  As the story opens, Lanita appears at a trendy salon in Los Angeles to have a facial, manicure, pedicure and her hair styled; a graduation gift from her husband.  In order to understand what led to this eventful occasion, Butler takes us back to Lanita's roots, alternating between the past and the present.<br /><br />Lanita was born at the height of the Watts riots and delivered inside a store owned by Jewish proprietors.  Because her birth was taking place, local residents assisted instead of looting.  Because of the owners' gratefulness, Lanita and her mother, Aretha, lived rent-free for many years.  But their luck did not hold out and the two were forced to move and live on welfare.  The one thing that Lanita had in her favor was her love of reading.  This love exposed her to a world she was dying to explore.  On the other hand, Aretha's vice became alcohol and the illnesses that go hand-in-hand with it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the structure that Butler used by allowing Lanita to tell her story to the employees of the salon which inevitably led us back to the beginning of her life, through elementary school, junior and senior high school, a stint at Howard University, her return home and the climax of her college graduation.  Lanita's voice is serene, her story sad.  JUST MY LUCK highlights what can occur when well meaning friends step in to look after a child.  The imagery portrayed allowed readers to focus on a vivid mental picture of the Watts section of Los Angeles during a time of upheaval.  Lanita always believed she was lucky and throughout we see her belief in the Almighty as her one and only lucky charm.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Pamela Leigh Starr has written a novel to enlighten, cheer and inspire hope for better circumstances.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-04
May I Express Myself?	The infamous and outspoken Charles Barkley provides his analysis of life as he sees it in I MAY BE WRONG BUT I DOUBT IT.  Barkley states this is not a basketball book, although basketball and sports is the vehicle with which he processes much of his thoughts. He gives us his take on societal issues with a canny and raw dialogue as only Sir Charles can.<br /><br />I was enlightened about Charles' views, but not surprised with the manner in which he spoke to his readers.  In a straight-to-the point style, Barkley lays out his thoughts on race relations, religion, sports management, the media and providing an honest day's work.  Michael Wilbon of ESPN and Washington Post fame provides the introduction and is the editor.  Although each chapter signifies what is to follow, it seems the intent of the editing was not the structure of his words because his thoughts are often repetitive from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />Barkley states that he likes to meet people and the book showcased some of the things he has done for those he has met.  These are kept secrets, because for years what we heard were his antics and his run-ins with the public and media.  Outspoken, Barkley lays down a foundation of being the best father he could be, and using as his motivator, not being the type of father his father was to him.  Furthermore, he lists Julius Irving and Moses Malone as his mentors early in his basketball career.  He took what they told him to heart and molded his life around their words and deeds.  The flip side is he attempted to play the mentor role to younger players during his stint with the NBA, to no avail.  Barkley pays homage to his mother and grandmother that is heartfelt and wonderful to read.  On certain issues some may think he is wrong and others may think he is right but the bottom line is, this is vintage Charles Barkley up close and personal.  Poignant and humorous, at times sad and joyful, he lays it all on the line for all to absorb.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswed by Dawn R.

My Sister's Keeper	Pearl Cleage returns to the literary scene with her latest book, BABYLON SISTERS, an endearing story about a single mother named Catherine Sanderson.  Cat, as she is affectionately called, has been raising her daughter Phoebe alone since day one and has always been there for her.  She home-schooled Phoebe, then later sent her to an exclusive private school.  As her daughter nears graduation and prepares for college things seem to be great between them - except for the secret that Cat has been carrying for years, the identity of Phoebe's father.  When Phoebe takes drastic measures to learn his identity, Cat must face the fact that the truth will be revealed and also deal with the pain that led to the secrets in the first place.<br /><br />Cat owns and operates a consulting business, which she named, Babylon Sisters.  Through Babylon Sisters, she has helped countless young immigrant women and saved them from wolves in sheep's clothing.  These women often found themselves living in substandard housing with exorbitant rent, being overworked and underpaid, and even forced into prostitution, but failed to notify authorities for fear of deportation.  Cat became a voice for these women, not only helping them get out of their particular situation, but also serving as a spokeswoman for their cause.  In anticipation of college tuition bills, she realizes she must get a job working for someone else so that she can continue to make ends meet.  When one of her speaking engagements results in a meeting with Miss Mandeville, a community icon with a thriving business, Cat believes her prayers have been answered.  But things are not always as they seem.<br /><br />This is one of those books that was completely satisfying.  Cat narrated the story, but her voice immediately drew me into the plot.  I could relate to her insecurities, her good intentions and even her stubbornness.  The pacing of the story was superb and there were plenty of surprises.  These twists not only added tension, but sometimes they added suspense while others provided humor and irony.  I always find it difficult to review a book I really, really enjoyed for fear I won't do it justice, and this is the case with BABYLON SISTERS.  The story touched me on so many levels, as a mother, as a daughter, as a woman in a relationship...and the list goes on.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerssion, but sometimes they added suspense while others provided humor and irony.

No strings...	Nancey Flowers is finally back on the literary scene after her 2002 release Shattered Vessels.  In her new book, NO STRINGS ATTACHED, we meet friends Felice and Sylvah.  Felice has been hurt not once, but twice, by men and refuses to be a fool to love again. After the heart-ache, she bounces back and it's all about her.  She doesn't mind being the other woman, with many men to accommodate her sexual preferences, because her pledge is to living her life as she chooses, and with no strings attached.  She's all about Felice, regardless of the situation, predicament, or consequence of her actions.  Sylvah is learning to love herself again after her husband asks for a divorce.  Though she loves and despises him, the realization that her marriage is over still isn't an easy adjustment, but what Sylvah needs is a dose of self-esteem.  After losing a bit of weight and spending some time with herself, she just might notice the opportunities before her.<br /><br />Through interactions with the men in their lives, their other two girlfriends (who have their own set of issues),and the unbelievable situations in which the characters place themselves, NO STRINGS ATTACHED boldly flaunts infidelity, betrayal, lies, and secrets.  When starting this novel, I felt myself thinking the book would be another one of the \\"my man left me, I'ma get him back\\" or \\"my man left me, I don't need a man,\\" type books, but not long after starting the book, I could see that Flowers had a few surprises in store for readers.  She weaves in a few twists to the storyline, introduces characters I hope to see again, and made me stand and applaud their actions a few times.  I won't go into the drama, but yep, that's thrown into the mix too and the end result is a book with three-dimensional characters who will make you question why they are the way they are.  In the midst of shouting \\"you go girl, \\" you may stop to reflect on yourself or those you associate with from day to day.<br /><br />NO STRINGS ATTACHED is a fast-moving tale painting a realistic view of the complexities of life and how one lives it.  Flowers writes lyrically and breathes life into her characters.  What I really connected to was how she blends humor throughout the dialogue and rounds the story out with a valuable lesson on taking responsibility for actions, past and present.  While I really enjoyed NO STRINGS ATTACHED, I wasn't overly happy with the ending as I didn't feel everything was wrapped up, all questions answered.  I do, however, look forward to the continuation as I'm sure some of the characters will be back to finish their stories.

It All Comes To Light	The Scott family gathers to pay tribute to their father and grandfather, James Alexander Scott, in QUIET AS IT'S KEPT by Janet West-Sellars.  In the days leading up to the funeral and the days that follow, a tale of secrets, deception and a longing for love is revealed.<br /><br />Shirley, Terry and Zee are the three children born to James and his wife Olivia, who died during the birth of Zee some 40 years ago.  Because of this tragedy, Zee often felt her father blamed her for her mother's death.  Unbeknownst to her, James has a deeper secret that he carried throughout his adult life.  Shirley and Terry are left to pick up the pieces of Zee's broken heart and serve as Zee's greatest supporters throughout her life.  James' children viewed him as a cantankerous and wretched human being and they do not mourn his death.  However, as a deacon of his church, James was revered by the congregation and by his neighbors for his good deeds.  Dr. Edward Marshall, James' best friend, is the catalyst of this story and he plays an integral role in the lives of the Scott family.  Suspense and mayhem surface with Edward.<br /><br />QUIET AS IT'S KEPT is told through the voice of each character with a realism that is genuine and empathetic.  Each sibling is unique in his or her own right.  Throughout, it veers off in narrative form and back again to the characters telling their side of the story of life with James.  The author definitely has a lot going on with the telling of this story.  So much so, that oftentimes I had to go back to review additional characters when they were introduced and the role they played, all in an effort of not losing the story line or mixing up the secondary characters.  There are many twists and turns, which all add up to a stunning conclusion.  This tangled web of deceit, jealousy and unrequited love is an unbelievable page-turner.

Beauty Comes in Many Forms	PRINCESS BRIANA is a wonderful story for children which teaches that beauty comes in many shapes, sizes, and colors.  Princess Briana is a beautiful, African princess who has the opportunity to attend the School of Elite's summer camp in Spain.  She has never been to Spain and is very excited about the people she will meet and the things she will learn.  Upon arriving, she saw many other princesses, but none who looked like her.  Though questioning whether or not she belonged at the school, she continued to her classes, excited to meet her instructors.  Shortly after, Briana wasn't too sure of herself, her beauty, or if she deserved to be a princess, so she tried to make herself fit in by changing her outside appearance.<br /><br />Though only a quick recap of the problems Princess Briana faced, this book was so much more.  It is brillantly written, creatively drawn, and the lush colors of the illustrator's palette bring out the beauty of the story. With the increasing number of television shows, commercials, and magazines teaching \\"beauty\\" standards, books of this nature are a gem for the community.  PRINCESS BRIANA should be a resource used in homes, schools, libraries, and churches to assist in creating positive self-esteem amongst children, regardless of their ethnicity.  It is a positve reinforcement that beauty comes from within and comes in all sizes, shapes, and colors.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-25
My name is Corinthia	CORINTHIA: My Name is Corinthia by Leonard `Cruze' Webb is about the spiritual coming-of-age for a little girl who narrates her unique story of learning that she has a special gift.<br /><br />Corinthia is a 10-year-old girl who lives in Germantown, a section of Philadelphia, with her Uncle Paul. She begins the story with her last day at the Catholic school she attends and her talk with one of the nuns who reveal to her that she has a special gift from God. For Corinthia this is very weird and difficult to understand. She decides to discuss this with her uncle when she gets home. But as children sometimes do, she turns her attention to the summer weather and her friends forgetting what the nun has told her.<br /><br />Immediately, certain events cause her to realize that something is very strange or special about her. Uncle Paul is having problems with his best wrestler, on a team he coaches, who doesn't appear to be motivated anymore about the sport. Corinthia senses her uncle's concern and goes to him and while placing her hand on his cheek tells him not to worry that his wrestler will begin doing better. As predicted, his best player does a complete turn around.<br /><br />She never played football in her life but suddenly Corinthia develops a skill for playing and becomes a quarterback for the boys' team. One day while playing street football, one of the players become angry with Corinthia and begins punching her, but his punches never touch Corinthia because there is a protective light surrounding her. As her uncle sees this happening, he knows it's time they have a talk. Uncle Paul takes Corinthia to church to speak with their pastor so that he can help shine light on his niece's sudden abilities. After conversing with her pastor, Corinthia begins to understand more clearly and accepts her spiritual gift from God.<br /><br />CORINTHIA is a well-written book that is told in a first person youthful style with a great sense of humor. The storyline was great and depicted a positive, inquisitive and religious tone for the younger generation. At the end of the story is a brief illustrated cartoon of Corinthia re-enforcing the importance of reading and studying the Bible.<br /><br />This is a must read for any young adult to enjoy and ponder God's words.

Macabre Tales	Supernatural and fantasy ultimately sums up PHOENIX TALES: Stories of Death and Life by Gregory Bernard Banks. The author has created a selection of short stories that feed into the sci-fi futuristic storytelling of life and death. Each original story is told in a style that keeps your attention page after page until the finale of each story.<br /><br />Examples of some of the selections are \\"Escape Velocity\\",  which is about a man in a nursing facility who doesn't seem to get it right when dying. He wants to go home to be with his granddaughter, but it is forbidden. When he finally does escape, with her help, his quest is finally fulfilled to the astonishment of his granddaughter. \\"Touched\\" is about a little boy who was genetically created and is shunned by the people of his town. What many come to realize is that this young boy has much to offer then just being different. A very touching story that really goes deep to the heart of being judgmental and hurting someone for no apparent reason. \\"Living with Mrs. Klase\\" is another unique story that deals with a husband who will go to great lengths to please his wife who is suffering from Alzheimer. She wants to relive Christmas over and over again, playing the role of Santa's wife. When they help a young mother and her two children who are running from an abusive boyfriend and are stranded in the snow, their lives take on a new turn of events.<br /><br />Each story has a moral base that reaches into the heart of understanding the role of everyone when life or death comes knocking at the door. Overall, Mr. Banks put together a collection of stories that definitely went beyond anything we would attest to as being in our day and time.<br /><br />I approached the reading of this book very carefully because I wanted to really understand where the author's style and depth was going to take me. The character development, the futuristic terms and sci-fi scenarios flowed well with each storyline. Although some readers may not enjoy reading supernatural/fantasy stories, those that do will welcome this particular genre. Regardless, PHOENIX TALES by Gregory Bernard Banks is a one of a kind book anyone would enjoy reading.

One wish and plenty of secrets...	Donna Hill is without a doubt a talented writer and a great storyteller.  It's been a rewarding experience shadowing her from her days of writing romance to her move to mainstream fiction and now as she offers something slightly different in her newest novel.  GETTING HERS is a story filled with secrets, friendships, and retribution -- getting back what should've never been taken away.<br /><br />Tess, Kim, and Nikki are three different women living in different worlds who probably would've never met, but they are connected by one factor -- they all have the same doctor.  After leaving the doctor's office, they are trapped inside an elevator during a city-wide power failure.  Tess, aka Madam X, once ran the biggest escort service on the East Coast, but she is on the run from the law.  Her twin sister is the Assistant District Attorney, committed to locking away the famous woman, but has no idea her sister is actually Madam X.  Kim is a highly successful executive, in charge of her own enterprise and the awe and envy of many in the business world.  Closer to home, her husband has a strong love/hate for Kim and uses a career-ending secret to divorce and blackmail her for full control of her company.  Nikki is a quick-tongued petty criminal, who was caught up with the wrong hustler.  After taking the rap for one of his crimes, she spent time in prison, suffering at the hands of those who tormented her.<br /><br />Each woman has something she's trying to get back and when the opportunity to seek revenge is presented, they weigh their options and then toss all cards on the table.  A proposal is offered up where the women will secretly draw names identifying the person they will \\"take care of\\" for the other woman.  The intrigue is that no one knows exactly who has whose name or how the murder will take place. They don't even know if their conspirators will even carry through with the pact.  An added twist is that there is no connection to the three women, so they are sure they can commit the perfect crimes.<br /><br />In GETTING HERS, the storyline was original and fresh, the characters are believable and multi-dimensional, and the writing is suspenseful, fast-paced, and entertaining.  The tale captures what readers look for in a great book, and I loved the ride shared with Tess, Kim, and Nikki on their journey to getting theirs.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel the journey was complete and was positive that my copy of the book was missing at least one ending chapter.  It was somewhat of a disappointment to read such an intriguing story to get to the end and find out that there wasn't really an ending.  It reeks of a sequel, which will delight some readers, but for me, I dunno on this one.  I want the final chapters now.<br /><br />Other than that, GETTING HERS is definitely a book which will draw much discussion and lead one to question at what limits they will go to get what they think should be theirs.

The tale captures what readers look for in a great book, and I loved the ride shared with Tess, Kim, and Nikki on their journey to getting theirs.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel the journey was complete and was positive that my copy of the book was missing at least one ending chapter.  It was somewhat of a disappointment to read such an intriguing story to get to the end and find out that there wasn't really an ending.  It reeks of a sequel, which will delight some readers, but for me, I dunno on this one.  I want the final chapters now.   <br />  <br />Other than that, GETTING HERS is definitely a book which will draw much discussion and lead one to question at what limits they will go to get what they think should be theirs.

Turning a New Leaf	In Terry McMillan's latest book THE INTERRUPTION OF EVERYTHING she once again tackles everyday issues faced by average folks in a believable fashion.  Marilyn, the main character and narrator of the story, has taken a good long look at her life and knows she has to make some changes.  On the surface, her life is one that many would envy.  She has financial security, and one by one her children are heading off to college and starting their own lives.  Even her role as taxi driver for her mother-in-law, who lives with Marilyn and her husband, is eased because her mother-in-law has a new friend and a sudden interest in getting her driver's license back.<br /><br />As everyone moves on with their own lives, Marilyn no longer needs to be consumed by the needs of others and she feels underappreciated, unfulfilled, and when she is totally honest with herself, bored.  Add in a husband with a mid-life crisis, menopause, a troubled sister, and her own mother's failing health and you have the recipe for a wonderful story.  As Marilyn looks forward, she has to decide how she will live the rest of her life.  Which deferred dreams will she go back and recapture?  What changes are necessary for her to find true satisfaction in her life? With supportive friends, a flawed, but deep-down loving family, and a lot of reflection, she navigates through all that life throws at her and plots her course for the future.<br /><br />THE INTERRUPTION OF EVERYTHING is a book that made me laugh, cry, scream at the characters, and at other times, root them on.  While all the characters were well developed, what really made the story work was Marilyn.  Her voice was, at times sarcastic, at times humorous, and always forthright and full of heart.  It made her come to life and in the process, drew me in.  Terry McMillan has crafted a tale that truly captures the essence of life.  While readers may not have personally dealt with every issue Marilyn and her family encounter in the story, they will know of someone who has.  And even if they can't relate to the events, they can relate to the emotions - love, betrayal, loss, emptiness and too many others to name.

Armageddon?	As The Bitten came to a climatic end, I wondered where THE FORBIDDEN, the fifth book of the series, was going, or more specifically, where L.A. Banks was going to take it. On Damali's twenty-first birthday, she gained full powers as a Neteru Queen; the vampire huntress, and a team of Guardians to assist her. Once she became aware of her destiny to hunt and destroy vampires she learned that her friend, Carlos was a master vampire. They share an irregular kinship, made more significant because they are on opposing ends of good and evil. But the history between Damali and Carlos goes back to times before Damali was the huntress and Carlos was a vampire; he was her protector when she lived on the streets.<br /><br />The civil war between  Damali, Carlos, Damali's Guardian squad, and the Vampire kingdom has just ended. The results brought, much chaos and many fatalities. The team is battle-weary and seeking refuge. An ill-advised predicament between Damali and Carlos has created a breach, and they must be chastened. Damali is separated from her team and summoned to the council of Neteru Queens. A disoriented Carlos is hidden from the Darkside and summoned to a council of Elders. Damali is stripped of some powers, Carlos is tripping on his ego, the Guardian team must step it up a notch, and time is running out. Damali and Carlos must be prepared to fulfill their destinies.<br /><br />During the civil war all of the top side vampire masters and three council level Vampires were exterminated. Lilith, the consort to the Un-Named One, is called to the seventh level of Hell to set affairs in order. This lethally sexy, black widow assassin has been given the power and authority to open the portals of Hell. She will prove to be Damali's fiercest nemesis. Her assignment is to wipe out Damali and the Guardian squad, but this Vamp has her own 'forbidden' history and her own secret agenda. Lilith has stolen an embryo that could produce the Anti-Christ, and give her ultimate power in the Vampire kingdom; but she needs Damali to accomplish it. A confrontation is inevitable, and what transpires is cataclysmic.<br /><br />L.A. Banks has again written an intense story with timeless characters and has unlocked the doors of her imagination in a way that is unprecedented. Where she takes THE FORBIDDEN is phenomenal. At some point, I realized that I was no longer reading a story, I was on an adventure. I anxiously await book six, The Damned. But this time I will be prepared, with silver bullets, garlic water, and a prayer in my heart. This is an awesome read.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersower in the Vampire kingdom; but she needs Damali to accomplish it.

Growing Up Black	BETSEY BROWN is the story of a young Black girl growing up in St. Louis in the late 1950's.  She is the eldest child in a large upwardly mobile family.  Her father is a doctor and a socially conscious \\"race man\\" who takes his children to sit-ins and protests.  Her mother is a social worker who wants to shield her children from the racially charged environment in which they are coming of age.<br /><br />Like any young girl, Betsey fantasizes about her young life, longs for the attention of a certain young boy and is fascinated with the idea of love.  While she is going through the ups and downs of growing up, integration takes place in the South.  Betsey and her siblings are bussed to white schools in the name of racial advancement.  The children have fears of what may lay ahead of them and the parents are conflicted in their decision.  While in their new enviroment the children have various experiences and emotions. Betsey often feels like the weight of the entire race is on her shoulders and no one understands her struggle.<br /><br />Ntozake Shange gives all of the children who grew up in the era of  southern integration a voice in BETSEY BROWN.  The storyline is written in simple language with traces of southern dialect dispersed throughout.  The novel gives a more visceral feel to the fear and uncertainty that children and their families had during the time of integration in America.  This fear was pushed aside for the overall principle of advancement and not told in history books.  While reading the novel, I felt like I was taken back in time to experience what, until now, I have only read about in textbooks and I enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that Betsey's story ended too soon.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Things you need to know	Kwame Kojo, after having spent some time with the justice system, has admirably written a book, THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOUR BLACK ASS FREE, to tell young people that there really is another way to exist. One of the items he discusses is respect, or lack there of, that black men and women have for each other. Not laying the blame entirely on one sex or the other, he urges both to reevaluate themselves and each other. Kojo also impresses upon them the need for education, although he feels the education system has been inundated with socialism, and above all else, young people should get to know themselves. Citing the principles of Kwanzaa, he suggests that these are good rules to live by.<br /><br />Kwame Kojo appears to have a desire to return to the days of segregation. He preaches that perhaps the Civil Rights movement was wrong to push for integration and that blacks were so much better off during Jim Crow in that they owned a few businesses and seemed to be a cohesive group. He fails to mention the horror, hurt and humiliation that accompanied segregation. In addition, he states that black youths between the ages of 12 and 25 commit 75% of the crime in America. I have difficulty believing that. He also mentions that 85% of the people in the justice system are black. Perhaps the reasons for that should be examined in depth. If indeed, it is the truth that will set us free, then what we need is the real truth. Kojo's writing style is elegant and it is an easy to read book that young people would find interesting.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
The Problem with America	There is a lot of research that attempts to describe or explain black urban culture. Few researchers have gone directly to the source to get their information, but Robin Kelley, a professor of History and Africana Studies at New York University, has done just that. He talks about black music, from blues to hip-hop, and its importance, whether simply aesthetic or economic. He covers graffiti artists and sports stars. Kelley explains how urban youth, who are facing severe unemployment as jobs move to the suburbs and out of the country, turn these activities into paydays for themselves. Using the public transportation issues of Los Angeles, he demonstrates how the poor people of color in this country can band together and bring about change.<br /><br />This book covers history, as well as the issues facing black people in America today. In an easy to understand format, Kelley explains the politics of surviving the ghetto and succeeding in life. He is critical of those new liberals who want to turn the battle into an undefined class issue, rather than identifying the various factions that make up that class, such as race, gender and gender identity. He describes neo-conservative blacks as 'negrocons.' It is a book well worth reading, and even though it was written before the turn of the century, it is still right on the mark. What he predicted is coming true.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Just how inept can one detective be?	Peter Ingalls gets banged on the head by falling books in the store where he works and suffers amnesia. When he awakens, however, he is convinced that he is a private investigator. He proceeds to open an office and hire a wanna-be actress as an assistant who curses like a sailor and quits every five minutes only to regret it and ask to be taken back. Peter always obliges. He even hires her back when he fires her before she can quit.<br /><br />He has two customers who come in for help. One has a missing boyfriend and the other thinks her husband is having an affair. Using 1940s private eye lingo and dressing the part so well people think he's wearing a costume, Peter manages to screw up both cases. He decides that both the women seeking help are actually lesbians who are having an affair with each other. Meanwhile, an actual murder and disappearance take place that are connected to his two cases. If it weren't for his foul-mouthed assistant, he'd never get to first base on either of his cases because, in real life, Peter is a naïve mama's boy who lived at home until his accident. Peter's bumbling manages to cause all kinds of problems. His inept behavior, naïve reaction to bad situations and brawls with his assistant cause laugh-out-loud reactions. Peter does manage to dig deep within himself and rise to the occasion and solve the mysteries.<br /><br />In DROP DEAD, MY LOVELY, Ellis Weiner has created a charming character that you want to give advice to and help along. You actually find yourself yelling at Pete when he's getting ready to do something really dumb and telling him to lose the fedora and the double-breasted suit. His sassy assistant, Stephanie, adds a wonderful dimension to the insanity of the private detective's office and his clients aren't too sane either. It's a book that drags you into the action while entertaining you.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
How much reality can you take?	Television producer Natasha Ward has come up with a new idea for a reality show that will rock the nation. Citing the statistics for black male to black female ratio to her superiors, she suggests having five fantastic black women and ten men of all races, with impeccable financial, social and educational backgrounds, on a Caribbean cruise for 10 weeks. The women would decide every week which man is voted off for not living up to their standards of the perfect man. At the end of the cruise, the remaining man would chose which of the five women he would like to spend his life with.<br /><br />Trouble brews before the show even begins when a fantastic brother, Tyrell Ramsey, catches Natasha's eye during the selection period. Tyrell has auditioned because he could use the $25,000 he will receive if he is selected to enhance his budding record company. Natasha, who has become irritable and bored with the process of interviewing arrogant men, is floored when Tyrell subtly shows his attraction for her.<br /><br />With the romantic settings, sexy music and hot bodies, everything that can go wrong, does. From the very beginning, these superb specimens of the human race show preferences. This is not supposed to happen and they are certainly not supposed to pair off because any sexual impropriety means automatic expulsion. Natasha and her crew are inundated with out-of-control lovers and angry people who feel rejected when their love interest shows interest in someone else. To top things off, Natasha has her own issues as the attraction she and Tyrell feel grows.<br /><br />Esdaile has written an exquisite romance about love on the high seas. She is a master at ferreting out human strengths and frailties. Her characters ring true and behave in the manner of everyday people everywhere. She has taken a television reality show and made it far more real than any we see on local stations. I would not hesitate to recommend this book for those who love a romantic story with a twist.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerstwist. <br /> <br />Reviewed by alice Holman <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br /> <br />	2005-07-17
A street novel with a moral	Ace, whose real name is Ali, is the modern day version of Don Juan. He has four women who all love him but he hops from woman to woman, taking what he needs, leaving nothing for them. Ace is also a drug dealer and hustler. He loves fine cars, pretty women, traveling and the latest fashions. It takes a lot of money to maintain his lifestyle and he is not above using his women to accomplish his goals. The women serve and additional service: Stacey, an accountant, helps him with credit cards and Keisha his street lady from the projects, takes up the slack for him in his hustles. He tends to leave messes behind, too: Keisha has two children she claims are his but the only child he recognizes is Samira's son, Little Ali. Nikki, the middle class, naïve, college student is pregnant and frightened.  Ace keeps all his women on a short chain, controlling their every action and he is not above slapping them around either.<br /><br />Tragedy strikes when Keisha is found dead on the side of a road and things start spiraling downward for Ace. Nikki wants him to just talk with her. His mother pleads with him to give up his hustling. Samira begs him to be a family with her and Little Ali, but Ace is addicted to the streets.<br /><br />Shahida T. Fennell has written a very interesting novel about life in the streets. Her characters are real and you find yourself sympathizing with them while also wanting to knock them in the head for being so greedy and blind to the realities of life. In THE LIES HUSTLERS NEVER TELL, Fennell also includes poetry that compliments the progression of the story. The poetry literally tells the characters the real deal. The ending was a bit strange and I'm not at all sure I really know what happened. Otherwise, it is entertaining and a different kind of urban fiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
The flight of the butterfly	The title BLACK BUTTERFLY'S REFLECTION has my imagination soaring high above the universe. I'm resting comfortably on the fragile back of a butterfly in flight, viewing many of the nuances that encompass life. As I read the pages, I searched for what the author intended readers to grasp. What I found were expressions from the depth of a woman who needed to share how she is able to gain strength from past adversities.<br /><br />With poems bearing titles with the simplicity of a single word; Butterfly, Rose, Dandelion and Broken Wings, readers are directly reminded of the butterfly and that adds  definition to the book's title, but the entire collection encompasses a broader, more diverse range of issues.<br /><br />DeLis has given readers a metrical feel that is indicative of versed poetry. Each poem tells a story about the mental hurdles in life, and elicits deep emotional reflections. BLACK BUTTERFLY'S REFLECTION is a good introduction to this author and a book of poetry well worth reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
An Oath Death	A group of five secret society martial art students take an oath of submission and obedience  to their master, Omega.  A few take pause before taking the ancient oath, not sure if it is a sound decision, but for the sake of cohesion, they all drink the mixture of blood and tequila.  Not knowing the consequences to follow, the group becomes remiss in their obedience to their master and unleash the wrath of the psychotic Omega.  Once the master is betrayed, the punishment is death, with a vengeance.<br /><br />William E. Self is from the Hawaiian Islands and the island of Kauai is the backdrop of BLOOD AND TEQUILA.  The description of the beauty of the island made it easy to visualize the story unfolding but the foreign vocabulary was a hindrance in the flow of the story.  Self included a glossary of terms but it took away from the reading enjoyment.  The storyline was filled with philosophical rhetoric from which I had to separate the meat of the story, which was quite interesting.

What makes a man black?	Dr. Winthrop D. Jordan in THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, has explored the reasons for racism in America. He not only explores the newly settled America, but goes back as far as the first contacts Europeans had with Africans. He suggests perhaps because white men encountered black men and great apes at the same time, they were inclined to think that there was a connection between them. French political theorist, Jean Bodin wrote, \\"promiscuous coition of men and animals took place, wherefore the regions of Africa produce for us so many monsters.\\" In spite of such writings, Dr. Jordan said that belief was not wide spread but was available as a theory for later use. Fast forwarding to America, Dr. Jordan cites the writings of Thomas Jefferson, who seemed conflicted knowing that black men were equal to white men, but doubting that black men were as intelligent as white men.<br /><br />The Quakers in America were the strongest abolitionists. Others often gave lip service to the wrongs of slavery but they also debated a white man's property couldn't just be taken from him or they used the Bible and the story of Noah's son Canaan and the curse of Ham to justify keeping black men in bondage. Their conclusion was that God originally made all men white and black men were black because God cursed them. Another theory was that the skins of Africans were black because they suffered from leprosy, the most hideous disease of those times. Also under consideration was that Africans were from a climate with brilliant sunlight but after spending time in a more moderate climate, their skins would lighten up. Of course that didn't happen.<br /><br />Winthrop D. Jordan, professor of History at the University of Mississippi, has written an explicit history that covers the mentality of the white men who enslaved black men and examines their justifications for doing so. He has done this by going to the original writings of the people who were commenting when all of this was taking place. At times I wanted to scream, especially when Dr. Jordan pronounced one comment against slavery as perhaps being a bit harsh. I would ask him if those slaves were his ancestors, would the verdict be the same? All in all, he did a good job of bringing out the prejudices and the hidden agendas of the white population who were looking for a cheap, easily identifiable labor source. In addition, he explains the ambivalence whites felt toward Indians and why they did not view them in the same manner as they did blacks although they also called them \\"savages.\\" The writing was smooth and easy to read with the exception of occasionally deciphering the Old English. I would recommend the book for anyone who is interested in how black people got on the receiving end of so much racism in America.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewerses I wanted to scream, especially when Dr. Jordan pronounced one comment against slavery as perhaps being a bit harsh.

How much can one woman take?	Marcia DuPree worshipped her father. Being bent on impressing him she even gave up her youth to study hard and do what he would want her to do. At 38, she was a judge and had at least one failed relationship with a married man behind her. She made sure her new love, Dakota Dillard, was really free and not scamming her as Mitchell had by not telling her he was married. Not attending church as regularly as she once had, she began to concern her parents. Branching out with a new girlfriend, Charmaine, who was a bit on the wild side, she realized the biggest mistake of her life was inviting Charmaine to her parents' fortieth wedding anniversary. Big mouth Charmaine took one look at Rev. DuPree and started talking loud, exposing secrets that were better left hidden. Gwendolyn DuPree, first lady of the church, was outwardly calm but when she got Rev. DuPree home, she came unglued. Things quickly spiral downward from that moment on and Marcia took it upon herself to investigate the charges that Charmaine leveled against her sainted father.<br /><br />Shelly Foster crafted a mystery that has more twists and turns than a mountain highway. It's impossible to figure out exactly who is doing what to whom because as soon as you think you have it figured out, it all falls apart right before your eyes. Foster has captured one of the leading issues of today: men on the down low. She explores the dangers, not only from HIV/AIDS, but also the psychological trauma for the women caught up with a man who is not being honest about his sexuality. The writing was smooth and the plot moved along at a decent pace although the subject matter could certainly be of concern to some. I was captivated by this bizarre story of love, hate and revenge and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Will she ever learn?	Once again we meet Cynthia Evans, partner in an architectural firm, mother and widow. She and her daughter Chris are apparently getting their lives back together after the poor choices Cynthia made in CHOICES, the first novel in this trilogy where she met and moved in with Thomas Alexander before she really got to know him. He caused considerable chaos for them before he disappeared.<br /><br />Now Cynthia is attempting to repair the damage and move on with her life. That is, until she meets Savonte Black, a suave partner in her new investment group. One kiss and she is madly in love or at least addicted to the magnificent sex that he is capable of providing for her. Chris is more than tired of her mother's antics. She asks Cynthia's friend, Ardelia, if she can move in with her until it is time for her to go to college because he is taking all Cynthia's attention away from her. Ardelia is worried about her friend's new love too, but talks Chris into being patient.<br /><br />While Cynthia is floating on cloud nine, one of the partners in the architectural firm accuses her of embezzling funds. Shocked and angry, Cynthia has a terrible car accident that comes close to killing her and her life goes downhill from there. Money from her account begins to disappear, along with her house and other assets. She wonders how this can be happening to her.<br /><br />In this new book, CONSEQUENCES, Shelly L. Foster continues the saga of Cynthia's poor choices in men. It is realistic in that Cynthia does not change overnight, even though she really and truly wants to become a different person. Whatever damage she suffered as a youngster continues to follow her, affecting the type of man she chooses and once again she is on a roller coaster ride to disaster. It is an excellent book and if the editing were a little more careful it would be top notch. If you liked CHOICES, you are sure to love this one as well.

There are things about Lana that Weslee doesn't particularly care for, such as her sharp tongue and her snobbishness, but Lana introduces her to a whole new world that includes friends and up-scale parties on Martha's Vineyard. Lana also introduces Weslee to upscale dressing and shows her how to buy expensive, name brand clothing. As a result, Weslee becomes addicted to shopping.<br /><br />Weslee meets several handsome men and one of them is Lana's cousin, Duncan. She also meets William, a friend of Lana's, and finds him attractive as well, but puts him on hold in favor of Duncan's charm, grace and good looks. In a very short time, she's head over heels in love and she begins to spend more and more money on clothes and shoes. Her carefully planned school budget takes a huge hit.<br /><br />Joanne Skerrett has written a wonderfully suspenseful love story about a young woman who has a tendency to rush into relationships before she really gets to know the man. In addition, when things begin to go sour, she doesn't hesitate to blame herself.

And the real translation?	When the Bible was translated from Aramaic into Greek, were the translators careful about how they did it? Or did they let their culture and their prejudices guide how the translation went? Floyd D. Braggs explores these issues in BETTER OFF BORN DEAD. He uses the book of Ecclesiastes, which is translated from Greek and was apparently written by King Solomon. However, translated from the original Hebrew, the name of the book was Qoheleth, which is, according to Strong's Concordance, a feminine word. Bragg points out when Ecclesiastes was written Solomon wasn't alive, so it had to be someone else who wrote it. He comes to the conclusion that it was King David's daughter and Solomon's sister, Tamar, who was the author. Reading Ecclesiastes from a female point of view changes the entire meaning of this book of the Bible. Tamar is showing her anger at the way women are being treated by men in her culture.<br /><br />Bragg discusses the early Catholic Church and how the church wished to keep women subjugated to men. The church was very much against the common members of the church reading the Bible at all. They preferred to tell the people what it said rather than have them read it for themselves and see it differently than they had always been told. As a result, the first translators were killed for their efforts.<br /><br />As a woman, it was sheer joy to read another version of Ecclesiastes. It was pleasurable to find out that 3,000 years ago, Tamar could show her anger at men for their desire to dominate women. Bragg also uses the scriptures in Genesis to show that God had no intention for men to dominate women, but for men and women to be partners. It was the original translators who put women in a position lower than that of men. Tamar, being a Qoheleth, was a female preacher, yet today in many churches, women are forced to be silent according to many ministers' understanding of the Bible. This is a must read for anyone interested in the Christian religion and the position of women in the church. It is a true eye-opener.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthe position of women in the church.

Little Girl Lost	How does a church-going, singing-in-the choir, piano-playing Christian end up as a prostitute? Her mother sells her to an eager white man, of course. Sixteen-year-old Johnnie Wise's life will be forever changed after the rainy Christmas Eve when her mother, Marguerite, decides to introduce her to the world of prostitution that Marguerite has inhabited since being sold by her own mother. Feeling soiled and dirty, Johnnie turns her forced prostitution into an advantage. Investing the money that Earl Shamus pays her, she uses her newly acquired bedroom skills to convince the man to buy her a home in an upscale black neighborhood. While all of this was taking place, she finds a man who truly loves her; she returns that love, promising him that the prostitution will eventually end. Then her new lover's gangster boss wants Johnnie and the true tension begins.<br /><br />Marguerite, in a fit of jealousy and envy over her sixteen-year-old daughter's good luck, attempts to blackmail one of her own customers, who just happens to be head of the Ku Klux Klan, into buying her a home in the same neighborhood. Things rapidly begin to fall apart for everyone when the Grand Dragon takes his revenge.<br /><br />Keith Lee Johnson has written a suspenseful novel filled with rage, revenge, sex and even genuine love. The picture he paints of Louisiana in the 1950s is fascinating and is something of a history lesson in itself. I do hope Mr. Johnson is writing a sequel so we can follow Johnnie Wise and witness the rest of her extraordinary life.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Let's Get It On	According to Eric V. Copage, SOULMATES  deals with the whole range of man-woman relationships in life - from finding a mate, to developing a relationship and sustaining that relationship.  As for sex, it deals with mood, grooming, seduction, sexual union, post-coital behavior and contemporary experiences as well as positions for sexual intercourse.  Copage was motivated to write this guide because the representation of Black love and sex was null and void in the literary arena.  He surveyed parts of the diaspora from Africa, the Caribbean and America and used the Kama Sutra as the framework to support his findings.<br /><br />SOULMATES is geared toward individuals in longterm relationships, but lends a helping hand to single folks.  The illustrations are also very sensual and erotic.  I purchased the guide for carnal reasons, but after reading it walked away with a more cerebral understanding of lovemaking.  I enjoyed sharing it with my mate and will continue to use what I have learned to enhance our passion.  My only complaint is that I would like to have seen more of those sexy illustrations (wink wink).<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Total hair care...	Black women go through various methods of curling, combing, perming, and styling their hair in order to get the right \\"do\\" to represent their style and personality.  Though geared to those wanting to go natural, this book is an excellent resource for those wanting to know the basics of haircare and key information on growing, grooming, and taking care of healthy hair. It covers areas such as what causes hair breakage, the different types of hair products, and how to transition from chemically processed hair to natural styles.  Most importantly, Mirielle Liong-A-Kong showcases the joy and benefits of going the natural hair route and leads the reader through the necessary steps for reaching his or her goals.<br /><br />Though there are some editorial flaws throughout GOING NATURAL and some portions are a bit repetitive, it does not distract from the message.  While I may not have fully decided to go natural, the book has definitely given me a lot to think about regarding how I tend to my own hair.  GOING NATURAL is an excellent resource for those contemplating the move to natural hair as it provides step-by-step procedures, illustrations, and other tools and resources. It's also a teaching aid for those who want to know how to care for and maintain their own styles.  It teaches the importance of debunking the myth that natural hair can't be beautiful and easy to maintain, and also celebrates individual beauty. I thoroughly enjoyed this educational read and hope to share it with family, friends, and my hairstylist.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Who will it be?	Lacy Foxx, reporter and single woman, is on a search for Mr. Right. She has just had a miscarriage and broken up with her boyfriend of several years. The loss of their twin babies has affected both Lacy and Sebastian and, while they both hurt, neither can reach out to the other for comfort, thus causing their split. Lacy is so angry with him that she refers to him as \\"Sebastard.\\" While volunteering at a youth center, she runs across an extremely handsome man named Winston, whom the kids have nicknamed Mr. T. Lacy and Winston seem to bring out the worst in each other and they dance around for weeks, feeling the attraction, but being too irritated to act on it. Finally they get together and the fun begins. Winston's secrets begin coming out and Lacy, although she is sure she is in love, begins thinking about Sebastian again.<br /><br />BULLETPROOF SOUL is a serious, yet hilarious novel about one woman's search for the right man. Michelle Buckley has created a character that is both funny and annoying. Lacy tends to be just a bit narrow-minded mixed with a touch of naivet&eacute;. She is also very human - vowing to be one kind of person, but slipping into another persona when the mood strikes her. Will Lacy find Mr. Right? Will she be able to handle her job and all the drama that comes with a man? Or will she be forever single and unfulfilled? BULLETPROOF SOUL is an entertaining novel and will captivate you from the first page. It shows the growth of Lacy Foxx from a needy woman to a woman fulfilled.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Do you ever wonder about non-fiction African American books?	Harry B. Dunbar, a reviewer, a memoirist and annotator of books, has written a definitive book about who writes black non-fiction and who publishes it. He gives the historical background of black publishing from slavery to the present day. It is a book that is rich in history and brings forth information that many may wonder about but haven't researched. In addition, he reviews several of his favorite black non-fiction authors: Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Gates, E. Franklin Frasier, Stephen L. Carter and Lawrence Otis Graham. He gives praise to various black publishing companies such as Genesis Press and applauds them for their contributions to the world of black publishing. At the end of his book, he includes a bibliography of African American non-fiction books, which is indeed a treasure.<br /><br />The book was well written, articulate, it made sense and would be great for a research project; however, is not the book for relaxing and just enjoying a quick, smooth read. In addition, it includes the history of Professor Dunbar's fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha and would be invaluable for those who wish to know more about the workings of a fraternal organization. When that big college project comes along, search out Harry B. Dunbar. He can help you out.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Do the poor deserve this?	When Bill Cosby came out with his acidic diatribe regarding the poor blacks of America, many jumped on the bandwagon, shouting that Cosby was correct in his assessment of the single mothers, welfare recipients, the incarcerated, out of work heads of households and those barely surviving on minimum wages. Michael Eric Dyson, preacher, writer and professor, in IS COSBY RIGHT? takes on his statements by looking into Cosby's life to determine how he arrived at such conclusions and why he felt it necessary to attack the poor so viciously. Dyson researches Cosby's shows, his university dissertation, Black History: Lost, Stolen or Strayed? and his interview in Playboy Magazine that expressed empathy toward poor blacks and discovers something of a disconnect between the Cosby of yesterday and the Cosby of today. According to Dyson, Cosby has always been uncomfortable confronting white America about white supremacy and it shouldn't be shocking that he lets them off the hook and puts the blame squarely on the victims' shoulders. In Cosby's show, he purposely made the Huxtables as race neutral as possible, double-checking to make sure that his black family never got involved in anything that could be construed as a \\"race issue.\\" He did the same with his comedy acts.<br /><br />In searching American history, Dyson found that the middle and upper class blacks have been ashamed of and making remarks about poor blacks since emancipation. Poor blacks, disdainful of white opinion, dressed and behaved in a flamboyant manner. It was this flamboyance that embarrassed the \\"Afristocracy\\" as Dyson calls them and made them find fault with their poorer brethren as the Afristocracy sought to emulate white America as closely as possible in order to blend in and be less noticeable.<br /><br />Michael Eric Dyson has penned a readable book that explores issues that many Americans of all colors would like left hidden. He discusses how poor  black people got where they are and the difficulties they face everyday that ultimately play a large part in why they remain in poor condition. He permits neither white Americans nor the Afristocracy to get off in their complicity in the conditions that have existed and continue to exist in white dominated America that feed the continuance of poverty. Even if you disagree with Dr. Dyson, you should still read the book because the history he talks about is never found in history books and also for his deeply intelligent discussion of issues that so many would like to see swept under the rug. None of us can hide when faced with the debilitating facts about poverty in America today.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerses they face everyday that ultimately play a large part in why they remain in poor condition.

Turning misfortune into satisfaction	MELANIE OSBORNE: The Making of a Female Private Eye by Laura Johnson is the saga of a young woman forced from her comfortable home into the streets. Melanie Osborne's parents were killed when she and her siblings were still youngsters. The children were separated into different foster care situations. Because she was an older child and there were few families who wanted her, Melanie was placed in a juvenile facility where she learned the ways of the street as well as discovering lesbian love. Finally, she escaped the institution and ran away to begin her life on the streets. Melanie runs into many characters, some out to harm her and others who want to help. She has to learn the difference in order to survive. A street person, Smokey, who believes in her ability to be more than a numbers runner, turns her onto private investigation.<br /><br />Laura Johnson has written an engaging novel about the sudden change from a calm, middle class existence to the grim realities of street life. The entire novel is written as a flashback, but this does not take away from the story. You tend to forget that you are reading Melanie's story as she lies injured in a hospital bed.  The action got bogged down with details as we learn how Melanie was changed from a street person back to a classy lady, and it slows the read just a bit toward the end. In all, it was an enjoyable novel, and I look forward to future works by Ms. Johnson.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
The good life	After finishing her graduate degree at Loyola Marymount University in production, Carla Thompson decided to launch her career in Los Angeles. She managed to land low-level positions in Los Angeles production houses. She also had a lot of car trouble and maxed out her credit cards attempting to make her own videos but somehow, she wasn't making it big time as she had planned. Her mother, retired from the post office after 32 years, invited her to come stay with her in Montgomery until Carla could get on her feet. Although Carla had been raised in Harlem, her family was originally from Alabama and she had memories of not so pleasant summers spent with her grandparents there when her northern accent and Catholic religion made her an outsider. Carla didn't have high hopes for her new home in Montgomery. After accepting teaching positions in two local universities, she was pleasantly surprised at the \\"New South.\\" It was not at all what she expected. She noted that blacks and whites have managed to create and maintain a peaceful coexistence and she didn't feel like that out-of-place person as she did when she was younger.<br /><br />Carla Thompson has penned a delightful memoir. She describes her trip from Harlem to Los Angeles to Alabama in a funny, witty way that is sure to win the hearts of those who have made similar journeys and those who wish they had. It is an honest assessment of life as she views it.

Love Mosaics	A group of three friends joined together to co-author a novel under the unique name of Tatu.  Their collective efforts produced LOVE MOSAICS: INDIGO BLUE, a contemporary romance that was a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Indigo is tired of empty promises men make and refuses to play the fool any longer.  She has  a son to raise on her own, while the father is in and out of prison.  She reluctantly agrees to go out on a blind date set up by her best friend Kenya and meets Kofi, a guy who just might be worth her time.<br /><br />Kofi immediately likes Indigo and the vibe between them is strong.  He is a good guy, but has issues of his own.  His previous girlfriend left him without an explanation when her unmentioned boyfriend was released from prison.  When he learns of Indigo's situation he sees history repeating itself and wants no part of it, but she has already left an impression.<br /><br />Tatu has their fingers on the pulse of the dynamics of today's dating environment.  They also have the female and male psyche down to a science.  The characters are well-developed and the storyline gives the readers a glimpse into the dilemmas of men and women, without being one-sided.  The language is current with that of adults in their twenties and thirties.

What people need to know about America today.	Americans have unfortunately lost their way in this world and it shows, from the media trying an accused person in the newspapers before a jury ever gets to hear the case, to changing the rules when a white man breaks the same laws a black man breaks. Maybe its because the country is built on a vast array of lies. The white man didn't come here to find a better life but to establish colonies for Europe. He attacked the Indians and then called it a massacre when the Indians fought back to protect their own. The white man then spread over the country taking land that wasn't his.  When the plantation owners discovered they couldn't cultivate their own land, they stole Africans from Africa and used their expertise and labor to do it for them. We, as black people, are not innocent because we do not take advantage of privileges, such as our voting rights and holding our elected officials accountable to the needs of all voters.<br /><br />George J. Dalmas, a former police officer, elected official of the Amalgamated Transit Union and an appointee of Mayor Richard M. Dailey, has covered the issues that face America today in just a few short pages. He is reaching out to the people of America, urging them to wake up and pay attention to what is really happening all around them. It is a needed book and I suggest that it should be used in high schools and colleges as required reading. It might slow our march to the what-happened-to-the-Roman-Empire syndrome. I would suggest some judicious editing to correct a few tense issues and awkward sentences, but otherwise it is a very good read and so very appropriate in today's political climate.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
Can environment triumph over character?	From the time Rita's father dies of an overdose of heroin and her mother turns to prostitution to feed her as well as her own thirst for alcohol, she feels that no one loves her. In RITA69GRL, Brian Williams follows her through her senior year in high school to her life as an adult. Rita leaves home before she finishes high school after being tricked by her boyfriend whom she thought loved her. Her mother doesn't seem to care whether she stays or goes. In her search for love, she always goes to all the wrong places and all the wrong people. She admits that she is a terrible judge of character. Then she meets Lanezane in a chat room online. They immediately feel an attachment to each other. After exchanging pictures online, they agree to a face-to-face date. Rita, knowing her penchant for choosing the wrong man, is apprehensive. How will he react when he finds out that she's been less than honest with him? Will he forgive her and be the one?<br /><br />There are several plot twists and turns that keep the interest in Rita's life going. The book begins slow and picks up speed as it goes along. A quicker start with more suspense leading to the finale would have been welcome as well as some editing for misused words. Williams is a good storyteller and it will be interesting to follow the series of books he has planned following RITA69GRL.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17
From heart to heart	FEELING POETIC will transport readers on an emotional path as Ms. Fyles alerts the heart to the triumph of finding love and the desolation of losing it. With six deliberate headers, she shares her concept on the different levels of feelings when love is the nemesis: Feeling Dreamy, Feeling Romantic, Feeling Confused, Feeling Frustrated, Feeling Abandoned and Feeling<br /><br />Encouraged.<br /><br />Have you ever sat in a reflective, melancholic mood and thought, \\"How did I let this person in my heart?\\" The poem Unexpected eloquently expands on this question.  Another engaging poem bears the title Why and bemoans the fate of people looking for someone to call their own. The poem quietly asks \\"Why can't it be easy for me to find someone that don't belong to another Soul? No attachments no holds; Independent like me, Free as can be.\\" FEELING POETIC presents questions that make you shake your head and contemplate love.<br /><br />Kudos to Ms. Fyles for these poetic verses that embody poetry, speak to the soul and reveal the deepest desires of the heart. I thoroughly enjoyed the message in each poem. I suggest you settle comfortably in your favorite place, get a copy of FEELING POETIC and take a journey through your heart.

Forgive Our Trespasses	Kiyah Simmons, a soon to be divorced mother of two, has prayed for the right man to come into her life, a good man, a man of God, but she does not want a stiff, rigid deacon or minister.  She does not want to be condemned for wearing jeans on a Saturday night or for wearing lip gloss every now and then.  After her failed marriage, she knows exactly what she wants in a man and believes she has found it in the smooth, suave and romantic Reverend Leon Booker.  He seems to understand Kiyah and accepts her as she is, but the good Reverend has secrets.  When Kiyah is finally exposed to the truth she will need her faith and the love of God to see her through.<br /><br />I was initially turned away by the title.  I did not believe that it would be entertaining or hold my interest, but it did.  It reads similar to chick lit but is undeniably Christian fiction.  I would often smile to myself at some of the antics of the characters, because I know someone just like that at my church or in my family.  I found fault with how the author displays the characters emotions by underlining and using all capital letters which I felt was not necessary and there were a few minor editing problems.  Despite those minor issues, the novel is an enjoyable read, better than I had anticipated. (RAW Rating 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-07-17

Just when she becomes somewhat happy with her life, tragedy strikes again.  Harlem feels that God has forsaken her from the day she was born, but being the survivor that she is Harlem sees to it that she comes out on top.<br /><br />Told in first person, IF I RULED THE WORLD is very descriptive.  It has a good supporting cast and the character development was constructed well; the small details give a deep understanding of the characters lives and struggles.  The storyline has continuity but becomes a little gritty for my liking at one point, although not enough to totally disgust me.

With two siblings deceased, she receives a cryptic letter in the form of a poem that another will die.  What begins as a search for the creator of the letter soon spirals into a tale of deceit and family shame in Vanessa Craddock's THE PROMISE BOX.<br /><br />Stationed in San Diego, Bernadette is on a mission for a promotion and the receipt of the letter could not have come at a worse time.  Taking a leave of absence and returning to her hometown of Baltimore, she soon finds all appears to be normal while at the same time strange.  Not receiving answers from her mother, her sister in New York City nor her brother in North Carolina, Bernadette along with her sister Bernice, are alone in the search until they come dangerously close to the truth about the source of the letter and their ancestry.<br /><br />THE PROMISE BOX is intriguing because I had a need to find out exactly what this family was hiding.  Why did the children of the Windsor family grow up relatively poor when their father's family was from a prominent African-American family?  What is the significance of the promise box that holds clues to the discovery?  Craddock did an excellent job of laying the visual image of inner city Baltimore.

Emotional and heart-wrenching	Just as one lives, one must also die.  However, the impact of that death upon friends and family members can be a very stressful ordeal.  It is often emotionally, physically, and mentally damaging to the mind, body, and soul, even crippling one from moving forward with his or her life.  Vanessa A. Johnson, a newcomer to the literary scene, shares the story of how she survived and coped with the death of her mother, followed shortly by the death of her infant son.<br /><br />Written in the form of a self-help book, WHEN DEATH COMES A KNOCKIN' is an informative look inside the grief process, that uses Ms. Johnson's experiences to educate, inspire, and encourage those who have gone through or are going through similar periods.  In her book, the grief process is broken down into the following steps:  Disbelief, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance.  The steps are pretty much self-explanatory, yet each of them are detailed with examples of things the author went through and how she finally made it to the last stage.<br /><br />She not only includes resources dealing with death and grieving, but she also shares scriptures that were instrumental in tying together her strong faith and belief in God, working though the grieving process.  Also included are things that helped her the most from family members, her support group, and others.  Though as a whole, I really enjoyed this book, my favorite section dealt with how to help someone who is grieving.  It is often that those offering condolences are left in a position of not knowing what to say, and this chapter clearly assists both the griever and those around him or her who want to provide comfort.<br /><br />WHEN DEATH COMES A KNOCKIN' is a story that needs to be told, a lesson that needs to be taught, and an inspiration that needs to be shared with grievers and those around them.  No one knows how they will react to the death of a loved one until it actually happens or until a period later when you're finally ready to deal with it.  In reading WHEN DEATH COMES A KNOCKIN', I was able to let go of some of my own grief towards the loss of both my parents who died pretty close to each other -- deaths I'm not sure I've totally accepted.

And a child shall lead them...	The Death Tribe was a tribe of children all of whom had special gifts.  Marked by their silver eyes and the sign of infinity, they were banished from their respective villages and lived among themselves in the jungles of Africa.  One interesting thing about the Death Tribe is that while each respective member had unique powers, their true powers were realized when they united as a group.  They were ultimately torn apart when a slave trader outwits and enslaves them.  Interesting, huh?  Well just when I got totally engrossed in this story line, author Gregory Townes flips the script and moves to modern times.<br /><br />David is a very protective father of his little girl Star.  They live in New York City and it is a summer of peculiar events.  Strange weather, news incidents, shocking experiences, even strange encounters with people on the street, all have David wondering what in the world is going on.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that a group of evildoers has an evil plan and that Star is vital to the plans success.  As it becomes evident that his daughter is related to these bizarre happenings, David realizes that he must fight for both his daughter's safety and his very life.<br /><br />THE TRIBE is one of those few books that left me totally speechless and this review will hardly do the book justice.  Gregory Townes has crafted an intricate tapestry, weaving together history, vivid fantasy, and wonderful array of characters.  Chilling, creative, captivating! He has written a novel that is intelligent enough to keep even the most die-hard sci-fi and mystery fans guessing, yet universal enough to appeal to all readers. Spiritual, yet cerebral and emotionally intense, THE TRIBE is a book that will not easily be forgotten.

Should love hurt?	Almost everyone has experienced an unhappy or bad relationship at one point or another in their lives; it just happens. But in how many cases does the unsatisfied person continue to fight for the relationship, hoping that one day their love will be reciprocated?  This is what happens in INTIMATE CHAOS by Cheril N. Clarke.  One spends all her time giving and showing love, the other spends her time taking and running from love.  Knowing it's best to move on, but failing to take action, Sadira Cooper continues the up again, down again romance with Jessie, ignoring the obvious signs Jessie gives her and feedback from those around her.<br /><br />Eventually Jessie commits to the relationship and the lesbian couple move to another city and buy a condo together, making their relationship official.  Unfortunately, being a couple is not much better than the times they spent dating.  Jessie is incapable of showing her love to Sadira and Sadira is unwilling to just let it go, for good.  When her eyes begin wandering towards a new woman in the neighborhood, Sadira scolds herself and tries to stay the course with her relationship. Jessie doesn't really know how to show her love.  Though she has strong feelings, she holds them back, afraid Sadira will eventually hurt her.  When she opens up a bit more and shares her feelings, will it be what the two need or will it be too little, too late?<br /><br />INTIMATE CHAOS was a slowly paced exploration of love and the journey taken through the various pit stops on its course.  Sadira's emotions made this novel speak to me in many ways, but specifically her hunger for Jessie.  I felt her pain, her happiness, her desires, and her love.  Clarke has done a remarkable job of sharing the story of love, that deep down feeling which causes its host to do anything, say anything, and put up with anything for the possibility of having that loved returned to them.  It shows the emotional and physical levels of intimacy in which relationships are built upon, and the hurt, heartaches, and chaos that can come about, especially when one hasn't let go of past hurts.  As an extra bonus, though this is the story of a lesbian relationship, the message transcends gender.  Anyone who has ever loved someone, lost them, or been the recipient of unconditional love will be able to relate to this story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Not Alone	INNER CITY NURSERY RHYMES is a collection of rhymes highlighting some aspects of inner city life.  The rhymes vary in length and are accompanied by bare bones illustrations.  The topics of the various selections include: black hair, hunger, prayer, family relationships, and even roaches.  The rhymes are set in the alleys, streets, and homes of the inner city.  Some are frighteningly realistic while others are reminiscent of a tall tale or fable, but each piece is presented in a non-judgmental manner that fosters a sense of acceptance.<br /><br />Barbara Harvey has put together a collection that will educate some and affirm others.  For parents and children with similar backgrounds, the book will provide a much needed reminder that they are not alone in their experiences.  Even readers who cannot directly relate to the situations will enjoy the light-hearted rhymes and are sure to be reminded of the things they take for granted.  Some of the selections were definitely better than others and the illustrations, although they related directly to what was being told, were so minimal that they didn't add much to the book.  In my opinion, a book of rhymes targeted to this age group should be a multi-sensory experience; INNER CITY NURSERY RHYMES could have achieved this with further editing or removal of some of the rhymes and more elaborate illustrations.  It was the overall impact of the book that caused me to rate it as highly as I did, as it was evident that the author is deeply committed to the social and emotional development of inner city children.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20

Gone but not forgotten...	Jermaine Grant, saddened by the death of his best friend Isaiah, spends his days just trying to cope with life.  Not only has he lost someone he considered as a brother, but the one person who always had his back.  To top things off, his fianc&eacute;e Nia Thomas traipses off to Chicago for a job interview without taking into consideration that Jermaine truly needs her to be there for him.  The last straw that finally breaks the camel's back is when he receives some devastating news from his past which will change his life forever.<br /><br />Nia is tired of always being the one making all the changes in her relationship with Jermaine.  She has tried being understanding of his needs but Jermaine has not reciprocated.  Nia is also faced with issues of her own when her past life resurfaces.  She soon realizes that it's time she makes some changes which may or may not include Jermaine.  When she is given another interview for the job of her dreams, she doesn't turn it down.  Jermaine and Nia both are faced with trials and tribulations in life, but will they ever realize the need to let go and let God?<br /><br />Renee Allen has penned a very poignant novel filled with secrets, lies and deceit.  All this mayhem coupled with the after-affects of the loss of a loved one is enough to send one over the edge of insanity.  Isaiah's presence is felt throughout the book and while reading this book, I found myself wondering if any of my deceased loved ones were sitting beside me.  Although the plot and characterization are on point, the little \\"umph\\" which would make this novel an above average read is missing.  I am however, patiently awaiting The Eleventh Hour, the follow-up to CONFESSIONS. (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20
A Plan for the Future	In his book, THE GOSPEL OF GOOD SUCCESS, Kirbyjon Caldwell depicts a pathway to what he refers to as `holistic salvation'.  To be successful on this journey there are six steps that must be personally internalized and outwardly exhibited.  These steps are: Finding Your Calling, Staging a Comeback, Embarking on a Faith Walk, Whupping the Devil, Creating Wealth God's Way, and Learn and Practice the Fundamentals of God-Blessed Relationships.<br /><br />Caldwell intertwines the word of God with his own personal experiences as the Pastor of Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, TX to clarify the steps to holistic salvation.  His flowing writing style is energetic, informative and thought-provoking.  He discusses with honest candor and a shining zeal the steps he has taken in his Christian walk to achieve spiritual success, and in doing so, he plants food for thought in the mind of his readers.<br /><br />When I first selected this book, I thought it would cater to having a successful business, and possibly offering advice on how to create and launch a business plan.  Yet, this wasn't really the case.  THE GOSPEL OF GOOD SUCCESS is an individual guidebook into healthier, more wholesome relationships with yourself, your peer groups and your God.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20

After several arguments on the subject, a rift ensues between the two.  Will Jamilah and Sabrina allow this man to be the cause of a lost friendship or will Sabrina take heed to Jamilah's advice?<br /><br />CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR is a very intriguing novel about friendship, trust and most importantly love.

Although, this was my first Cheryl Faye novel, I can assure you it will not be the last.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20
A fun collection...	Acclaimed authors Alma Flor Ada and F. Isabel Campoy have combined their talents to present a collection of sayings, nursery rhymes, games, and more.  MAMA GOOSE: A Latino Nursery Treasury expounds on heritage and how various cultures have contributed to what is now considered Latino tradition or folklore.<br /><br />My favorite portions of the book were the jump rope songs, proverbs, and birthday songs.  Remembering my childhood, I was able to revisit some of my favorite songs and compare them to the ones presented in MAMA GOOSE. What I really enjoyed was that the book was written in both Spanish and English, allowing everyone, regardless of background, to appreciate the selections.  I enjoyed being a kid again, reading, singing, and playing with the characters of this book.  My daughter also loved listening and giving her own renditions of the colorful illustrations drawn by Maribel Suarez.  MAMA GOOSE is a wonderful selection I'd recommend adding to any child's library as it's sure to be one of their favorites.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Getting it right...	Kama Sutra, Comma Sutra...hmmm, interesting, huh?  Can sex sell good grammar?  Perhaps there is a way to combine the two, yet produce an instructional guide that is entertaining and informative.  Though I don't know Laurie Rozakis' inspiration for coming up with her latest book, I do know that the title immediately caught my attention.  COMMA SUTRA: Position Yourself for Success with Good Grammar is a writer's guide with a twist.  Playing off the sex guide Kama Sutra, she uses wording more reminiscent of foreplay than dotting \\"I's\\" and crossing \\"T's\\" to give a memorable lesson most will pay attention to and actually learn.<br /><br />As there is a lot of sexual innuendo, such as \\"Assume the Position,\\" \\"Spice Up Your Life,\\" and \\"Sex and the Single Sentence,\\" I would definitely wait until the college level to introduce it to students, but it is a great lesson in grammar.  Broken into three parts, the book teaches the basics of writing, moves into proper grammar and punctuation, and delves further into problem areas such as subject/verb agreement and misplaced modifiers.  Divided into three parts categorized as \\"Basic Training,\\" \\"Be a Player,\\" and \\"Bring It On Home,\\" Rozakis offers fun quotes and tests for the information covered.  Much more is included in this handy little writing guide.<br /><br />Original, fun, and educational, COMMA SUTRA: Positioning Yourself for Success with Good Grammar is sure to be a big hit with those interested in perfecting the written word.  Readers, writers, editors, teachers, and libraries should definitely have this book in their arsenal.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20
When is enough, enough?	MBridges will soon release ARE YOU SATISFIED YET?, the first novel in a series of books revolving around the lead character Betty Jean.  A very prolific writer, having already penned several of the follow-up books, MBridges has impressed me with not only her writing, but with the vision for her work. She has a detailed plan for this series, as well as other books crossing into various genres, including a spy thriller, in the works.  With her first offering to the literary world, she presents Betty Jean, a character tired of her life; not in actually living, but in how she's living it.<br /><br />Ezekiel Johnson has issues.  He \\"loves\\" Betty Jean and can't imagine his life without her, yet after several years of being involved, he still can't totally commit and stop messing around with other women.  Betty Jean is intelligent and has her professional life under control, yet she can't seem to get it together with her personal life.  She loves Zeke and takes him back repetitively, in hopes that he'll change, commit to her, and propose.  She knows about the other women, but feels he'll be ready any day to make her the only one.  Carla is the main woman Zeke is with, and she knows she has him caught up in the pleasures she can provide.  She also knows that he's not leaving Betty Jean.  This cast of characters will definitely keep tongues wagging as they each ask themselves if they're satisfied, and if not, are they willing to make changes in their lives -- within themselves and in their relationships.<br /><br />While I admit my tolerance level is a lot lower than the characters in this book, I cheered them on, talked to them, slapped them around a little bit and even empathized with them.  We all know love and relationships are definitely hard work, but they shouldn't be full of lies, pain, or sorrow.  ARE YOU SATISFIED YET is an eye-opening, soul-searching journey of how one can become burdened by the betrayals of life and love.  MBridges takes a deep look into what a person goes through when they've simply had enough.  I loved my journey with Betty Jean and company and look forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

When we practice to deceive....	Jaunie Sterling, going by her alias Dominique, was every man's dream.  A woman that would make even the purest of the saints, fall to his knees.  Due to her undeniable beauty, mistrustful women paid her to go undercover to test the faithfulness of their husbands and fianc&eacute;s.  Jaunie's advances always worked, that is until the day the devastatingly handsome Trenton Douglas turned her down.  Once Trent found out his encounter with her was planned, nothing in Jaunie's life could compare to the tongue lashing she received from him.  After what could be described as the ultimate humiliation, Jaunie decides to seek another form of employment.  However, thoughts of Trent never strayed far from her mind.<br /><br />After the horrifying ordeal, Trent packed his bags and left town.  Now five years later, he returns to start a new life as partner in a contracting firm with his best friend.

But what Trent has failed to divulge is his attraction to her since their first encounter, as the reason for his disbelief.  When Jaunie's life is threatened, will Trent finally throw caution to the wind and learn to forgive and forget?<br /><br />PRIVATE LIES is an awe-inspiring tale of two people destined to find happiness.

In order to save money to buy a house Richard comes up with this brilliant idea of Rachel and the kids moving to Albany, Georgia to live with his mother.  Bored to the nth degree, Rachel sets out to find something or someone her age to keep her occupied.  In the meantime, her only solace is her daily conversations with Aunt Bea, her mother-in-law's sister.<br /><br />Aunt Bea, after years of harboring painful secrets, is seeing a therapist for depression; she confides in Rachel, but forbids her to tell her sister.  Rachel now faces the dilemma of helping Bea without jeopardizing her confidence, and finding herself as well.<br /><br />Colette Haywood has written a very inviting story of two women struggling to overcome adversities in their lives. She touches on child molestation, racism, homosexuality and mental illness. Although the novel is filled with numerous misspelled words and grammatical errors, they do not distract from the storyline.  The ending, in my opinion, was rushed and I felt as if I missed something.  With a little editing and tweaking, PEACE BE STILL will enlighten readers for many years to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20
A Biography Fit for a Diva	Ruby Pearl Elzy was born in small town Mississippi, but even when she was a young child it was evident that her voice would be too big to keep her there.  Her dream of becoming an opera singer seemed unfathomable considering the fact that her father had abandoned the family and her mother worked multiple jobs,one as a school teacher, just to meet the basic needs of the family.  But like her mother, Ruby had strong faith that God would make a way for her and neither of the two women was afraid of hard work.  Their faith and work ethics, coupled with the dedication and help from others, both black and white, allowed Ruby to continue her education and eventually study at the famed Juilliard School.  Despite racism and the barriers it created, she was able to perform on stage, radio and film, her trademark role being that of Serena from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.  Although she never accomplished her dream of starring in Verdi's Aida, her brief career was full of notable accomplishments.  Tragically, Ruby Elzy died in her prime, before she could accomplish her goal to sing in grand opera.  Yet, she left an indelible legacy that has inspired many.<br /><br />Before I picked up this book I didn't know who Ruby Elzy was, but thanks to this book, I not only know of her accomplishments, but also a little about her on a personal level.  I was even inspired to search online for audio clips so that I could hear the voice I read so much about.  David Weaver has crafted a work that is a perfect balance between Elzy's personal and professional lives.  When he writes about issues such as her divorce from her first husband or her relationship with her father, he does so with a respect that is often missing in today's biographies.  He also does a wonderful job recreating the zeitgeist of the 1930's era by providing just enough relevant historical information.  It is obvious from reading the book and scanning its extensive endnotes that BLACK DIVA OF THE THIRTIES is a well-researched book; it provides a comprehensive view of an important, but often overlooked woman, whose life was cut too short.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersed book; it provides a comprehensive view of an important, but often overlooked woman, whose life was cut too short. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-20

Letting go of it all...	Happily in love with her husband, Sheridan Heart is caught off guard when one morning after breakfast and kissing the kids goodbye, he tells her he's in love with someone else.  Because they just celebrated Christmas and New Years with gifts of love and words of adoration, somehow his statement doesn't fit.  When asked to repeat himself, he does and goes on to say that he's actually in love with a man.  Sheridan's world stops as she tries to grasp the fact that the church-going, loving, and sensitive man isn't quite who she thought he was. For the past seventeen years, he's been keeping a secret that makes her question if their great love is a lie.<br /><br />Amidst dealing with her own feelings, Sheridan must temper those of her two children, adjust to the attitudes of her parents, and learn when to ignore those of her church and community.  She has to rely on her instinctive reactions to her husband's confession and also learn how to be patient and let him get through his problems.  Though no one is sure exactly how things will turn out, it's evident that with God, all things are possible.<br /><br />This is a heart-wrenching story of a woman's loss, pain and sorrow, brought about by the one person who promised to love and protect her.  GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS is to be lauded for its relevance to our changing world, the lessons on love and forgiveness, as well as, how trust and faith in God can get a person through even their darkest times.  Victoria Christopher Murray is one of my favorite authors, not just in the Christian Fiction genre, but she is known across genres for her ability to help the reader connect with the characters, offer compassion, and open one's eyes to all facets of a situation.  Because of its subject matter, it should be read by everyone, not just by those merely looking for entertainment as it offers so much more.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Small but Mighty	Powerful.  Insightful.  Inspirational.  Eye-Opening.  These are all adjectives that describe VOICES OF INSPIRATION by Gerard Henry.  No, this book is not lengthy in terms of the number of pages inside, yet it is weighty in terms of the messages it conveys.  There are 55 life-affirming, biblical messages contained within the pages of VOICES OF INSPIRATION.  Each message opens with a thought-provoking quotation from a well-known person such as Bishop Eddie Long, Yolanda Adams and Tonex - just to name a few.  Then, a biblical reference is followed by Henry's further commentary on the topic and lastly, the passage wraps up with a prayer.<br /><br />With the level of self-exploration that it evokes, this book is not for the faint of heart.  Some of my personal favorites are the passage on \\"divine surgery,\\" gaining wisdom from life experiences, and a very popular scripture, Psalms 23, reminding us that God the shepherd who always is watching over us.  No matter your season in life, VOICES OF INSPIRATION will reach through your walls of trial and tribulation and bring a healing touch.

Young Expressions	LOCOMOTION by Jacqueline Woodson tops the list of originality with thought provoking words from a little boy named Lonnie. Although LOCOMOTION is categorized as poetry, it is not written as one of the traditional styles of poems that rhyme. LOCOMOTION is a collection of poems that reads as a story with uniqueness and wonderful grandeur. Every word echoes a young child's hurt and rediscovery of self.<br /><br />Lonnie, who lost his parents in a fire, writes in first person in the book.  He tells a story through poetic form of suddenly being left alone and separated from his little sister, Lili. Lonnie is encouraged by his teacher to write down all this thoughts as soon as they hit his brain. He writes about living in a foster home, visits with his sister and going to school each day. Lonnie continues his thoughts about the new kid in school, his friends and learning about sickle cell anemia for the first time. He writes of trying to believe in God, as his little sister has done, believing one day they will be together as a family. The most heart wrenching part was his words of about not having his parents with them anymore and learning that he and his sister would be living in separate homes.<br /><br />I have never read such an enjoyable children's book as LOCOMOTION. Jacqueline Woodson has opened new doors of poetic style and humble offerings. Although this book is written for ages six to twelve, a book of this magnitude can be enjoyed by all ages. Several selections brought tears to my eyes and caused my heart and soul to interact with each word. The heartfelt meaning of why Lonnie was expressing himself through words was moving. Jacqueline Woodson has indeed written another award winning children's book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17

What will become of Tanya and Zander when he realizes his heart just isn't in it?<br /><br />Ingrid Monique's debut novel UNDENIABLE is a quick and enjoyable read. The chemistry between Mara and Zander is so strong, you can feel the fire through the pages. The things you can't have are the things you want the most as is the case with Mara and Zander.

Sweet Revenge	Denmark Vesey Wheeler, is every woman's dream: a hard worker, nice looking and a faithful husband. He is also very much in love with his wife Sierra Montague Wheeler, and would do anything to make her happy. Denmark has never felt a love as strong as that in which he shares with Sierra. He can't believe he was able to hook such a beautiful catch. Sierra has Denmark's nose wide open and his friends can't believe the change they have seen in him since marrying Sierra.<br /><br />Denmark is on cloud nine as he prepares for his wedding anniversary; he can't wait to surprise Sierra with a very romantic evening. But the surprise is on him, when he learns his princess has been cheating. Denmark is devastated and can't believe that the one woman he chose to love, cherish and honor until the end of time, has betrayed him in the worst way.<br /><br />Denmark devises the ultimate plan of revenge: he plans to sleep with the wives of the husbands who have slept with Sierra. It seems like the perfect way to impart hurt upon those who have hurt him, but in reality the plan backfires and Denmark is in for the shock of his life.<br /><br />OTHER MEN'S WIVES by Freddie Lee Johnson III is a wonderful read that touches on controversial topics such as: infidelity, lying, betrayal and revenge. What I enjoyed most about the book was the character development. My heart went out to Denmark, who in an effort to be the ideal husband was bitten by the infidelity bug. I could see how much he cared for Sierra and was willing to do anything to make her happy. And as much as I loved Denmark, I couldn't stand Sierra. She didn't know a good thing when she had it and had the nerve to place blame on Denmark. The realism of the story was on point: some people sure know how to mess up a good thing. Having read all of Mr. Johnson's previous novels I was eager to read this one, and I must say, he didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Nigerian Nightmare	GRACELAND is the story of a sixteen year old Nigerian Elvis impersonator, who just happens to be named Elvis.  He and his father leave their small village following the death of Elvis' mother and a failed political bid by his father.  They both endure a permanent pain from this loss and neither seems capable of recovering.  After leaving his grandmother and the rest of his family, Elvis' life is never the same.  He struggles for survival in the brutal ghettos of Lagos always with the dream of escaping to America, and feels like an outsider in his own home.  Somehow Elvis finds himself in the company of extremely dangerous men who involve him in all matters criminal from pimping and panhandling to the trafficking of drugs, human beings, and body parts.<br /><br />Chris Abani introduces us to the harsh reality of life in a Lagos ghetto, but does so with the skill of an experienced author.  His tale utilizes themes of good vs. evil in following the inevitable clash of the King and the Colonel, but he also addresses other issues such as citizens vs. the establishment, slavery, incest, and child rape.  Abani added a nice artistic touch by using names to aid in characterization.  For, example Elvis' father, Sunday, seems to be a man who has taken an eternal day of rest after the death of his wife and his failed political campaign.  Another character, Freedom, is a teacher, and many people believe that education is the key to true freedom.  But, of course, the obvious question should be about our title character.  Why Elvis and Graceland?  Well, certainly Elvis, the entertainer, personifies Americana to a large part of the world and this Elvis' goal is to become part of the American Dream.  Like the American Elvis who enshrined his mother's remains at the estate of Graceland, this Elvis has taken his mother's journal and enshrined it in a Fulani pouch he constantly wears around his neck on a large chain (miraculously, even after being stripped naked and tortured in jail).<br /><br />The only shortcoming I saw was Abani's failure to deal with the grief Elvis must have experienced on learning of the death of his grandmother after the fact.  This woman was his rock of Gibraltar after his mother died.  I just wish Abani had explored this critical loss further.<br /><br />GRACELAND is a stunning coming-of-age novel that tells the story of a boy who wasn't allowed to be a boy.  He was forced to grow up quickly in a world over which he had absolutely no control and with a questionable barometer of right and wrong.  This is a book that evokes extreme emotions and will have your insides twisted with relief that you live in America (as imperfect as it is).  Chris Abani has created a literary piece that is raw and poignant, a real reflection of what it is to mature in a country in constant turmoil.

Although historians are almost exclusively interested in Hannibal and his innovative war-fighting tactics, Durham chose to expand the depth of his research and bring Hannibal's family and the world around them to life.<br /><br />To be sure, this is a novel and many of the characters are fictionalized, but Durham gives us an intimate view of the travails of these ancient soldiers and the people who loved them.  The story begins with Hannibal having conquered Iberia (now Spain) and setting his sights on toppling Rome.  While the massive army undertakes its arduous and dangerous, not to mention famed, alpine march, Hannibal's wife struggles to make the best of life without him for the foreseeable future.  She is Iberian by birth, but must now find her place among the North African women of Carthage as she awaits her husband's questionable return.<br /><br />History buffs, adventurists, and romance readers will have something in common when they read PRIDE OF CARTHAGE.  Durham has written a novel that will satisfy readers from almost every genre.  From the agonies of war to the love of family, the loyalty of friends and comrades, and assorted political intrigue, PRIDE OF CARTHAGE covers a gamut of plots and sub-plots.  The characters are authentic and believable.  Their fears and concerns are real and justified.  At 576 pages, some readers would be dissuaded, but it is worth every moment of time spent on it.  The writing is crisp and flows well, keeping the reader captivated until the dramatic end.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17
Truly missed	When Tupac Shakur was killed, the world went into mourning.  Not because of another brother felled, but because a dominating lyrical force would be no more.  THE ROSE THAT GREW FROM CONCRETE is a collection of poems, brilliantly written, without premise or shame from a young man who constantly fought against society's injustices, cruelties and convictions.<br /><br />Realizing that life is nothing but a collection of soul searching, Tupac captures his deepest feelings on paper during a time of loss, pain and anger.  Most of these poems written in this anthology are from his teen years, while others are from his stint in prison, where he was able to let his rawest emotions flow without prejudice.  He freely voices his opinions on life, honestly faces his views on love and shamelessly embraces the mistakes he made, making sure to poetically infuse his \\"language\\" into the hearts of many.<br /><br />With passion and grace, Tupac commanded respect.  He wished for hope and peace; within himself and the world.  THE ROSE THAT GREW FROM CONCRETE is a vivid snapshot of who the man really was, a picture of a lyrical genius.  Although it's been a number of years since his departure, he has left a legacy that will never be erased.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17
I Am My Own Worst Enemy	DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO is a profound look at the clutches an environment can place around people who do not know love, only loneliness; who see no way out and believe they are invincible.  January's thought process is to do what he needs to survive and carve out a financial future.  January records his thoughts, hopes, desires, and fears in letters written to a 1968 Chevy Impala, his best friend.  I found this tactic different and interesting.  He does this inside of the Chevy while escaping from the realities of his life.  Realities brought on by adults and later by him.<br /><br />Frederick James Preston has written a riveting and captivating tale full of realism and has also done a great job illustrating the confusion and pain of January Calhoun III.  Though a gifted young man, January is gripped by an environment that the reader hopes he will be able to escape.  There is violence, drug abuse, sexual escapades, scandals and other surprises that make this book an exciting read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Justice Overdue	BLOOD ON THE LEAVES by Jeff Stetson turns up the volume on originality, suspense and mystery. It is a bold new step for an established writer who has received many awards for his projects in the theatre and movie industry.<br /><br />The storyline takes place in Mississippi, a stronghold of several unsolved killings and lynchings against blacks during the Civil Rights era. Professor Martin Matheson, an activist, discusses several of these cases with his class and distributes a list of the black victims and their white accusers. The list includes their names, addresses, and other pertinent information.<br /><br />When the white accusers begin coming up dead one by one by the very same method they killed the black victims, all attention is diverted to the professor. Assistant District Attorney James Reynolds, who is also black, now faces the difficult task of prosecuting the professor. However, because of the issues in the case, he will also have to come to terms with his insecurities and haunting dreams that keep him awake at night. He is matched up against the professor's defense attorney who is a liberal white Civil Rights lawyer who will become a strong adversary during the trial.<br /><br />The suspense, and political foreplay is nonstop and takes you on an educational journey on life and times in the south during the Jim Crow years. The courtroom drama becomes the main plot, leading up to the grand finale. Both the primary and secondary characters complement each other with strong dialogue and intensity in bringing to the forefront a unique blend of issues, drama and emotions. Who is responsible for the murders? Is it a lone vigilante, members of his class, or the professor?<br /><br />Jess Stetson is a writer to watch on the literary scene. His writing style and strong character development put him at the front of the line. What makes BLOOD ON THE LEAVES stand out impeccably is the subject matter and how well it is presented to the reader. The originality of the plot made it an instant winner. I highly recommend BLOOD ON THE LEAVES because it is a great book to choose when you're looking for something unique and different.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersty of the plot made it an instant winner.

The Game of Life	We have all dealt with trials and tribulations. After all, it's part of the game called life. And we all know that trouble doesn't last always, but for Amos Brown trouble it seems to follow him wherever he goes. He has just inherited two brownstones from a father he never knew, and along with his inheritance, comes all the problems associated with being a landlord: building concerns and tenant issues. In addition to that, Amos is indebted to a big time drug lord, Harry, for a poker game gone bad. To add fuel to the fire, Gloria, Amos' wife of six months, has left him after his numbers running business has failed.<br /><br />For Amos life couldn't get any worse, or so he thought, until he finds a skeleton that has been buried in one of his buildings. Finding out who the remains belong to and how the person ended up in his building sets Amos on a rollercoaster ride that he may not be prepared for. The person could be a lot closer to Amos than he dared to imagine. Who could it be? And more importantly why were the bones buried in his building of all places?<br /><br />A LANDLORD'S TALE by Gammy L. Singer takes you on a suspenseful and  emotional ride full of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. Singer does a great job in depicting life in the heart of Harlem; it made me feel as if I were there too. The story was very well written with strong characters that you could find in any given city. What I enjoyed most about the book was Amos himself. Although he had a lot going on in his life, he was a strong individual who was able to deal with the cards life dealt him without losing himself. He even had a little time for romance. If you are in the mood for a page-turner with just a touch of humor, this debut novel by Gammy L. Singer is the book for you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Will They Ever Learn?	Well, it's finally here, Connie Briscoe's CAN'T GET ENOUGH, which is the sequel to P.G. County.  After reading it, I can truly say the folks in P. G. County just can't seem to get enough.  They continue to be embroiled in each other's lives, playing \\"keep up with the Joneses\\" and let's hide my little secret this week.  You will wonder aloud if some will ever learn from past indiscretions.<br /><br />Ms. Briscoe adds a new twist: royalty moves into Silver Lake.  The excitement has all the residents trying to figure out who it is and how to get on the guest list to the housewarming party.  This new resident is none other then a Baroness, and she wastes no time getting to know her neighbors.  The women all vie for her friendship as they spend time giving her all the juicy details and gossip about the neighborhood.  What they don't know is the Baroness is planning some retribution of her own.  Just who is her intended target?<br /><br />The Bentleys return in this story with Barbara making her mark in the working world.  She has new friends, a new wardrobe, and a whole new attitude.  Her husband, Bradford, is in for the time of his life; the new Barbara seems to be a challenge for him as the tables have now turned. Jolene Brown, who still craves being rich and respected by any means, has lost the one man who truly cared for her.  She realizes a few trysts too late just what she had.  That realization doesn't sit well, as she begins to brew up some trouble of her own for her husband and his new girlfriend.  Sadly, they have a hard time sustaining their relationship much less entertaining the antics of a scorned wife.<br /><br />Connie Briscoe has crafted yet another intriguing saga about the inhabitants of Prince George County.  Candidly written and expertly put together, Briscoe shows exactly why she makes a great storyteller.  This book has something for everyone to love or hate, be it in the form of the self-made millionaires like the Bentleys, the do-it-yourselfers like Pearl, or the social climbers like Jolene.  They all presented some very real issues to discuss, like living with and after adultery, being overweight and dating, revenge and jealousy, and blending families together.  Integrating a couple more characters to the fray with a few surprise twists added just the right touch to keep me interested and reading into the night.

Poetic Thoughts	The influence, whether it is visual or spiritual, to inspire someone to compose poetry is fascinating. URBAN LOVE THOUGHTS ON THE SUBWAY by Vaughn A. Young is one example of visual influence. Riding the New York subway daily among a diverse group of beautiful women was Mr. Young's inspiration to annotate notes that lead to his book of poems.<br /><br />It is a neat, hand-printed text collection that speaks with a sensual flow and rhythm. I compared each selection to a beating drum where emphasis is indigenous to each word. The poem \\"Retirement\\" showcases Mr. Young's rhythmic style and highlights the depth of his emotions in this final ode to a ladies man who was retiring from the game. It was unique and brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />Although URBAN LOVE THOUGHTS ON THE SUBWAY describes itself as a sensual and erotic book of poems, a few were not. I also felt that a couple of the selections were repetitive in substance even though each poem had a different theme. Mr. Young's book has great originality, however, it still didn't fully hit the erotic nerve and offer the fulfillment I expected.<br /><br />Overall, URBAN LOVE THOUGHTS ON THE SUBWAY by Vaughn A. Young,<br /><br />is a well-composed book of poems that is entertaining as you travel to your destination, whether riding the subway, train or plane. It's a nice poetic read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17

Death in a Steel Town	The blast furnaces of the No. 5 Steel Mill in Steadbridge, Pennsylvania have been cold for decades when Tom Kruvener returns to his hometown to convert the abandoned mill into a movie studio.  Although Tom manages to conquer his own demons by returning to the place he'd sworn never to set foot in again, he finds himself totally unprepared for the ghosts that now inhabit the mill.<br /><br />STEEL GHOSTS is the story of a man who spent the first eighteen years of his life in a small steel town and lost his father to a gruesome accident in the mill.  Over the years, many others died in the mill before they closed the gates, including the husband of his childhood crush, Ruth Fawcett.  Tom and Ruth rekindle their romance while the stagnant Steadbridge experiences an influx of prosperity with the arrival of the new studio and the flurry of activity surrounding a B horror movie production.<br /><br />Michael Paine sets the stage for a horrifying thriller as victim after victim is pursued and, ultimately, consumed by the evil inhabiting the mill.  Paine gives the reader an interesting background and storyline, and the action, although predictable, runs true to genre.  Although the story lacks the fear factor that would keep this reviewer awake at night, horror buffs will be satisfied and find the events at the mill perfectly ghastly.

Business or Pleasure	If you are married or in a committed relationship, can you imagine working with your mate? It's one thing to be together while you are at home, but to see each other each day in a working environment is something totally different. I know for me if my husband and I worked together,  we would probably be divorced now. I would rather keep business separate from my personal life and vice versa. LOVE ON HOLD by Christine Townsend delves into the lives of a newlywed couple who also work together.<br /><br />Jet and Cara Stevens are happily married and very much in love. They both feel as if nothing or no one can come between them.  Both are very savvy business people who take their work very seriously. Jet is the owner of a major corporation, and after marrying Cara, she comes to work for him and heads a division of the company, which makes Jet her superior. There's trouble in paradise when they disagree on an issue that's very dear to Cara's heart.  The two who were very much in love, become virtual strangers in their own home. The icing on the cake is when Jet takes sides with a beautiful new communications director over Cara regarding a controversial business deal. Cara is so upset she decides to take a job in another city. Jet feels as if Cara is walking away from their marriage, but Cara simply needs some time away. Will the time away from the marriage be beneficial or detrimental for Jet and Cara? Can a love that once was so strong weather the storm?<br /><br />LOVE ON HOLD, the sequel to Passion's Promise,  is an enlightening read that takes a look into mixing business with pleasure. What I enjoyed most about the book is that although it's a sequel, enough information was given and you could follow along without being lost if you, as in my case, hadn't read Passion's Promise.  Also, Jet and Cara are very strong-willed and well-developed characters who you can visualize and connect with through the writing. After reading this book, it confirmed for me that I would never want to work with my husband. Mixing business with pleasure is still a no no in my book.

Til Death Do Us Part	The day you get married is undoubtedly one of the happiest days of your life. You and your spouse have dreams of a life full of happiness, children, travel and growing old together. But what happens when an unsuspected tragedy occurs that puts an end to all of your hopes and dreams?<br /><br />Andrea Hamilton is a very happy, thirty-five year old married mother of one. She is living the American dream, she has the house, the husband, a job as a dental technician and a beautiful precocious five year old daughter named Kayla. She also has loving parents and a twin sister, who is also her best friend. She is active in her church and has a hoard of loving friends. When someone needs to be encouraged or needs words of inspiration it is Andrea they go to. She has been called the rock, for she is their strength when they have none.<br /><br />Tragedy strikes when Clayton, Andrea's husband of ten years is killed by a drunk driver.  Andrea finds herself on the receiving end of comfort and it doesn't sit too well with her. She is accustomed to being the strong one, but with losing her husband she doubts she can be that way again. The thought of living the rest of her life without Clayton and raising their daughter alone is devastating to Andrea and she doesn't know how she is going to survive. In addition to the loss of her husband, she finds out she is pregnant with the baby her and Clayton have been trying to conceive for months. This is icing on the cake, as Andrea wants to be happy but is finding it hard in dealing with the death of her husband and the thought of raising not one, but two children alone.<br /><br />Andrea's friends and family do all they can to comfort and encourage her but it appears to be done in vain, as Andrea doesn't appear to want to be helped. She finds herself distancing herself from all of those who love her and just can't bear to go on.  Will Andrea continue to live a life of constant grief? Or will she open her heart and allow God in, when she previously shut Him out as well? Can this strong woman pass this test and put all her faith back in God and become the woman she once was?<br /><br />A TEST OF FAITH  is a heart-wrenching and touching story that is sure to get your tears flowing. Billings does an awesome job depicting a grieving widow whose faith is definitely being tested. Because I am married I could relate to Andrea in that I have two small children and I am also a source of strength for several of my friends and family. I can not imagine my life without my husband, but could visualize having the exact same feelings and emotions that Andrea had. The story is so emotional and real, that it had me wondering if I would be able to be strong if something happened to my husband or would I too, want to give up? When someone has a long term illness their passing isn't a surprise as you have time to prepare yourself, but when someone dies suddenly it is devastating to all those who knew the person and the pain is a little harder to bear. When you have a strong connection to the characters in a book and the storyline, you know the book is a winner, and A TEST OF FAITH is no exception.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Memories of Yesterday	As a teenager Tammy Gibson was involved in a motorcycle accident that left her blind.  Her first love, David Dixon, was the driver and his recklessness caused the accident.  Fast-forward to the present, we see Tammy as an aspiring singer residing in San Francisco, California, singing on the night club circuit and also lending her services to teach at an institute for blind children.  Entering into her life is former composer Sterling Phillips, who is shrouded in mystery.  Is Sterling's desire to compose for Tammy out of pity?  Or is his desire to mold her into an award-winning performer out of love and hope for the future?  This set up is ironic because Sterling was the driver in an automobile accident, which killed his wife, left his young son blind and ended Sterling's musical career.  Dealing with the guilt of this accident and a past accident, sets a chain of events in motion from which the characters may never recover.<br /><br />Beverly Clark has given us some endearing characters such as Tammy's foster parents and younger brother and a humorous character in the form of her personal assistant, Mikki.  Mikki is outspoken, hilarious and a true romantic at heart.  Raining on everybody's parade is Sterling's son who must overcome his anger to lead a somewhat normal life, but his attitude towards his father and people in general is distracting him from the task at hand.  His pleas and cries for help are heartfelt and moving.<br /><br />ECHOES OF YESTERDAY by Beverly Clark showcases deceit, understanding and forgiveness but is a strenuous read because of the detailed accounts of the characters' thoughts and feelings. Detail is good but their reflections prolong the climax, which takes forever to come to fruition.  However, the author does a very good job of providing the emotional and psychological aspects of blindness and how it affects families, friends and associates.  In Clark's attempt to provide a scenic landscape, often told through the voice of Sterling, she also provides a lot of Northern California history, which is captivating.

The Man with the Midas Touch	Joseph Bologne, also known as Monsieur de Saint-George, could do it all.  This brother was a master of fencing, connoisseur of women, hunting, riding, and dancing, political activist and patriot, a renowned violinist, and a prolific composer affectionately dubbed the \\"black Mozart.\\"  Saint-George was at home among kings and queens and became the first black colonel in the French army.  His regiment consisted of a thousand men of color and became known as the Legion of Saint-George.  Saint-George became so popular in his lifetime that he was mentioned in the letters and memoirs of other great men of that era, including John Adams and Alexandre Dumas.<br /><br />Alain Gu&eacute;d&eacute;, a French journalist and one of the foremost experts on Saint-George, has accumulated two decades of research on the popular chevalier (knight) and produced a biography replete with minute details of this gifted man's life.  At times, the book reads like a Hedda Hopper gossip column as Gu&eacute;d&eacute; shares tidbits that are undoubtedly fact, but so sensational that they border on the incredible.<br /><br />Gu&eacute;d&eacute; used his extensive research to share the story of Saint-George from his semi-privileged beginnings as the son of a slave and a French nobleman on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe to his place at the height of Parisian society.  This minutiae makes for many shifts in the timeline and becomes rather confusing, necessitating frequent re-reads to regain proper perspective.  Although keeping up with the generations of aristocratic families and their various political and social machinations that affect Saint-George's fortunes becomes overwhelming and dry at times, the attention to detail is to be commended in re-introducing the world to a true renaissance man.

A  Heart of Gold	I first heard of Oral Lee Brown a few years ago when one of the children from her original class was accidentally killed. I read a little about Mrs. Brown and when the book came up for review I had to get to know the lady behind the heart. I was not disappointed, this book displays an angel in disguise.  A humble woman who just wants to do all she can for those in need. Determined, dedicated and courageous are words I would use to describe her and each of the classes her foundation takes on.  The child who initially inspired Oral Lee to start her foundation, was an angel sent from God, to help Mrs. Brown fulfill her purpose here on earth.  In addition, to this being an inspiring read, there are tips on applying for college found at the end for both parents and students. If you need inspiration to do something you have been putting off, reading THE PROMISE will give you the motivation you need.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Love Conquers All	An attraction that eventually leads to love can be revealed in a most unsuspecting way. Is it true that love is in the eye of the beholder and love can conquer all? I'LL PAINT A SUN by A.J. Garrotto integrates the above myths into a story that transcends all boundaries when two people become attracted to each other.<br /><br />Libby O'Neill, part owner of Liberty Restorations, comes home to find her partner and husband-to-be has run off with all the money that belongs to their business. She faces possible bankruptcy until another business opportunity offers Libby a way out of her financial dilemma. She anxiously accepts the contract to renovate the exterior of a beautiful Victorian home owned by a charismatic individual.<br /><br />While working with her best friend in the church soup kitchen, she shares her good news, and also reveals that she needs a helper. Her friend suggests that she ask one of the homeless people to give them an opportunity to work and help them make a change in their lives. She recommends a man who frequents the kitchen daily wearing a painter's cap and goes by the name of Painter. Libby is very hesitant at first, but makes the move to ask if he would be interested in working.<br /><br />Painter, who chose to become homeless and wander the streets to punish himself, reluctantly accepts Libby's offer of work. He holds tight the secret of his true identity and former career along with several burdens he carries on his shoulders. As Libby and Painter begin working together, a mutual attraction develops. Although Painter has much to hide from Libby, will their intimate feelings with each other be enough for him to be truthful with her?  Is Libby using Painter as a rebound because of her failed relationship with her ex-fianc&eacute;?<br /><br />The beginning of the book started out good and kept my full attention as I continued reading page after page.

Family Drama	TOO MUCH DRAMA by Debra Phillips is steeped in family drama that captures your<br /><br />attention from the first page.  Donneeka LeBeau is a twenty-four year old<br /><br />executive at her family-owned business, Diva Four Cosmetics, who is determined<br /><br />to live her own peaceful life.  This would be fine if it weren't for her<br /><br />controlling mother, Adeena LeBeau, and her two prying sisters, Mercy and<br /><br />Princess.  Adeena is a woman who has worked hard for success and refuses to<br /><br />settle for anything less for her daughters.  She controls everything from<br /><br />their work lives to their housing, and if she has her way, their love lives.<br /><br />Donneeka has decided that enough is enough as she plans ways to assert her<br /><br />independence.<br /><br />Written in a light-hearted and hilarious manner, TOO MUCH DRAMA is a quick<br /><br />read filled with enjoyable characters that draw you into their web.  I enjoyed<br /><br />the connection between the family members as well as Adeena's determination<br /><br />for her daughters to live rich, full lives.  I would like to have<br /><br />learned more about the family's background and what drove Adeena to push her<br /><br />daughters and herself in the way that she did.  Despite that, TOO MUCH DRAMA<br /><br />was a satisfying read filled with laughter, drama, and love.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17
The Twisted Lie	Tayari Jones tells a poignant tale of love and loss in her sophomore novel, THE UNTELLING.  Its theme revolves around the \\"lie\\" that the dogwood tree is stunted and gnarled because its wood was used to construct Jesus' cross.<br /><br />The telling of lies and the keeping of secrets has twisted something inside the women of the Jackson family.  Aria believes she is pregnant and is overjoyed and ready to begin a new phase in her life.  Regrettably, unforeseen circumstances cause her to tell a painful lie that is bound to be uncovered.  Eloise has constantly preached to her daughters the necessity of living a responsible life, but has kept a secret for many years that has warped her maternal perspective.  Hermione is the lone voice of reason calling out to her mother and sister in the wilderness, desperately trying to impart a semblance of reality.  But neither is willing to sacrifice her artificial existence, so Hermione has semi-alienated herself from the family.<br /><br />Comfortable, and at the same time, literary, THE UNTELLING is a story that will touch the emotions of mothers and daughters who have struggled in a timeless quest for mutual validation.  Tayari Jones has done an excellent job of characterization, from Cynthia, the neighborhood crackhead in pursuit of a lost \\"rock\\" among the gravel in Aria's driveway, to Keisha, the pregnant teen struggling to get a GED so she can get a job anywhere besides Subway.  This novel is big on the literary side, and more thought-provoking than exciting.  Literary lovers will revel in the angst and introspection Jones offers and eagerly await her next work.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17
Getting It Right 101	Take a moment and sort through all of your self-help books on relationships that include, but are not limited to ways to please your mate, how to get him or her to listen, how to know what your mate wants, how to bring sparks back into your marriage and how to keep or find your soul mate. Remove them from your bookshelves and add GETTING GOOD LOVING by Audrey B. Chapman, an all-in-one self-help book providing all the answers and methods to the questions and concerns you have with your relationship and marriage.<br /><br />GETTING GOOD LOVING is a wonderful new-age book that outlines, with great expertise, the many issues black men and women eventually face during their courtships and marriages. The author examines several issues such as controlling, feeling insecure, demanding attention, using sex as a way to get what you want, giving and receiving the wrong signals, playing with each other's emotions and refusing to compromise which in some cases are rooted from childhood and negative social protocol. For example, a man who grows up in a fatherless household has only his mother as a role model. Therefore, he may have opted to be more attracted to a woman who reminds him of his mother with expectations of the latter.  With similar situations, some women may opt to be more attracted to older men using them as the father they never had.<br /><br />Ms. Chapman's book goes into depth explaining the argumentative areas that couples face and introduces techniques on how to help couples and individuals work collectively together to arbitrate their issues. She is thorough and leaves nothing to ponder. What gives additional credence to this well written book is Ms. Chapman relating several clients' cases giving the reader a wide variety of situations and how she expertly advised each couple or individual.<br /><br />This is a must read for everyone who is currently married, in a relationship or looking to commit to one and especially for those who are experiencing difficulties with their mate. GETTING GOOD LOVING provides remedies and simple solutions to achieving the good loving that everyone desires. I applaud Ms. Chapman, who also hosts her own radio show, for finally giving us something that we can relate to and realize that we are able to enjoy a loving and positive relationship.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersiculties with their mate.

Restoring Faith	Valerie and John's marriage is in trouble.  For the past year they have been married in name only and go about their daily routines as housemates as opposed to husband and wife.  Because of their inability to conceive and ultimately carrying out this feat, Valerie and John separate emotionally from each other.  Due to a lack of communication and negative assumptions, another man enters Valerie's life and she contemplates leaving her marriage for what looks like happiness.  Valerie declares that God put this man in her life for a reason.<br /><br />Through a series of Christian conferences, retreats, counseling and the meddling of friends, Valerie attempts to find her way back to her marriage and back to God.  Laced with an abundance of scriptures and designed to teach one how to pray, THE ALLURE captures the essence of finding your way with conviction and commitment to Him.<br /><br />Written primarily through the voice of the wife, as I was reading I wanted to hear John's voice and his take on the matter.  King-Scott does not disappoint and allows us to finally hear John's musings and his pleading to help save his marriage.  At times drawn out, the author savors this tale as in real life by taking her time and examining all aspects to finding our way through His will.  THE ALLURE pits man against woman and ultimately God because they have lost their way from each other and especially from Him.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

A True Soldier	After reading GANGSTA LEAN by Rochan Morgan, the lyrics to the song  \\"Soldier\\" by Destiny's Child came to mind: \\"If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him, betta be street if he lookin at me, I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me.\\" It's the story of a young boy at the turning point in his life, and he needs to decide what type of soldier he wants to be.<br /><br />Allen Richards, affectionately known as Pooney, is a fifteen year old student who has a life full of opportunity ahead of him. He is a star athlete on the football team and not too shabby academically. His father is currently incarcerated, and he lives with his mom, Regina, and his younger sister, Sheila. Regina is busy working the night shift, and her two children are home alone free to do as they please. Pooney's best friend, Tony, persuades him to join Deuce-Nine Crips, a local gang. Pooney joins and immediately loves his newfound family.<br /><br />He becomes a baller as soon as he is jumped into the gang and has money, women, a nice car and gains much respect from the other members. After a while Pooney's gang activities begin to interfere with his education, but this doesn't stop him from continuing to gang bang. After several incidents, Pooney realizes gang life isn't for him, not to mention one of the highest ranking gang members is showing an interest in Sheila, Pooney's little sister. Pooney has a decision to make: does he continue to be a soldier in the gang? After all, when you join you are in for life and getting out won't be easy. Or will he be another type of soldier and do the right thing by getting out, no matter how hard it will be, and focus on school, football and normal teenage activities?<br /><br />Rochan Morgan's debut novel, GANGSTA LEAN, is a compelling and heart-wrenching story of self-discovery. Pooney is a young man who loves his mom and sister dearly and doesn't want to do anything to hurt them. It is his heart and sensitivity that draws me to him. He just gets caught up in gang life and ultimately realizes there is more to life than gang banging. What I enjoyed most was that the characters were very well developed and loveable. Anyone would be able to relate to the Richards family. If you are looking for a touching story of a young man coming to grips with who he is, then GANGSTA LEAN is the book for you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

The Man from Atlantis	J Milligan opens his debut novel with the emergence of the most inept assassin ever.  Agent Jack Fish is sent to the Topworld as an operative of the government of Atlantis.  His mission is to kill a rogue agent, and it isn't as easy as they said at the secret agent academy.  Jack finds himself caught up in the mad hustle of the boroughs of New York as he tries to assimilate with the natives and locate his target.  Now, if only he can get the breathing air part down.<br /><br />Milligan's humor is raw and irreverent.  He speaks to the young urbanites of today, and if you don't understand their lingo, you just might be lost.  His imagination is tremendous as he effortlessly contrasts the sometimes seamy denizens of performance art, raves, mosh pits, and crowd surfing to the preppy, sleek Barney's-clad young corporate-types in the glass towers.<br /><br />JACK FISH sparkles with fluid, descriptive passages that would stir envy among more seasoned authors.  Milligan's characterization is excellent; each voice is dynamic and unique.  The plot falls a little flat at the end which is a minor disappointment after the distinctive style and charisma that flows through the rest of the book, but it is nevertheless a quick and entertaining read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17
The Choices You Make	Life is about choices. You can guide the direction of your life by the choices you make. Sometimes when you are young, bad decisions are made that may or may not be detrimental to who you become as an adult. There are some cases where people make bad choices as youth, but learn from their mistakes and turn their lives around, and then there are others.<br /><br />James Valentine, aka Ringo, is a very successful rapper who is living the life of luxury. He has a beautiful woman by his side, trustworthy friends, and money to boot. He is a smart businessman who has made his way to the top by his own hard work and determination. Ringo hasn't always lived the lavish lifestyle. He came from humble beginnings and opted for a life of crime for quick and easy money. Ringo has a heart of gold and criminal activities really aren't his forte, but unfortunately at the time it's all he knew. On his own time, his passion is, and always has been, music. He would write rhymes and dream of one day making it big and making his money legitimately.<br /><br />Ringo's dreams come true, but just as he was coming to grips with all the fame and fortune around him, his past creeps up on him and turns his world topsy turvy. Everything he has worked for could come crumbling down all due to the last crime he committed a few  years ago. What could Ringo have done that could end his career? Will he learn from his past mistakes or continue to make bad choices, in spite of the fame and fortune?<br /><br />RAPPERS 'R IN DANGER by Relentless Aaron is a fast-paced, thrilling read. My heart went out to Ringo every time he did something I knew was gonna get him in trouble. I kept saying to myself  \\"when is he going to learn?\\" Although the storyline was a good one, the grammatical and typographical errors are what gave the book the rating it received. There were several inconsistencies with the spelling of names of the characters: Porsha-Portia, Samaii-Sumaii and Jaime-Jamie. There was even one case where one person started out dating someone in the beginning of the book, but was referred to as dating someone else later  in the story. I found myself getting so caught up in the errors that it took away from the book.

The Essence is in the Drop	It is hard to call DROP a coming-of-age story considering the protagonist, Chris Jones, is a thirty-one year old college graduate, but because of this character's growth and evolution, it still qualifies.  Chris has graduated from a third rate Pennsylvania state college and finds himself woefully unemployed and grappling for survival in a West Philly ghetto.  He lives in constant fear of the \\"pop, pop, pop\\" of gunfire outside his window at all times of the day and night.  He feels as if he is merely marking time, waiting for his life to come to a tragic end right where it started.  That is, until he meets David.<br /><br />David owns a tiny advertising agency in London and hires Chris.  Chris' new life takes on a very hip and glamorous trend as he maneuvers through the very black and urban, yet bourgeois, neighborhoods of South London.  He even manages to find a very elegant and beautiful Nigerian girlfriend.  Life is good until a twist of fate threatens it all.<br /><br />DROP is Johnson's debut novel and showcases his extraordinary talent.  His writing is inventive and darkly funny, yet so lyrical and eloquent in quality you will want to read passages aloud.  Reminiscent of Wright and Baldwin, Johnson's writing is deeply layered and textured, but by no means old-fashioned.  He is a writer for this millennium.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-17

The Amen Corner	CAN I GET AN AMEN by Janice Sims, Kim Louise, Natalie Dunbar and Nathasha Brooks-Harris has two common denominators, Red Oaks Christian Fellowship Church and the church matriarch, Maybelle Carmichael.  Set in Red Oaks, Georgia, this book of novellas appoints a picturesque landscape of the community.  The minister of the church, Reverend Avery, laces the stories with appropriate sermons allowing you to visualize and hear the gospel tunes coming from within.  Mother Maybelle is the force behind the relationships as she meddles her way into each encounter.  Each story boasts beautiful women, handsome men, small town gossip and jealousy.<br /><br />A Love Supreme by Janice Sims pits landscape artist Alexandra Cartwright against businessman Jared Kyles, who is totally against commitment and marriage based on what he perceives as a biological gene.  Love and Happiness by Kim Louise hosts Renata Connor as an entrepreneur providing job placement and skill training services to at-risk young men.  Mother Maybelle makes it her business to recommend Red Oaks Church as a possible sponsor to cure Renata's ailing business.  Renata is paired with Devin McKenna, the outreach ministry and entrepreneurial ministry's coordinator.  A Love Like That by Natalie Dunbar showcases Dominique Winston, a divorcee who struck out in the marriage game and became the talk of the town and the church.  She is the apple of Blair Thomas' eye, a race car driver and engine designer who is in town for six weeks visiting an old college buddy who happens to be a deacon at Red Oaks Church.  And finally Love Under New Management by Nathasha Brooks-Harris highlights Valerie Freeman as a woman with a secret as she finds her way to Red Oaks Church to listen to their award-winning choir.  There she is in awe of the choir director, and the church is in awe of her voice.<br /><br />Each story is laced with sins of the flesh, faith and the power of prayer; however there is nothing compelling about the stories.  There is the typical romance formula of boy meets girl with an obstacle the characters attempt to overcome.  As usual, you root for the male to get his girl and vice versa.  I would have liked more significant drama and more work put into the relationships. The redeeming qualities are Red Oaks Church as the main setting and Mother Maybelle because of her insight when it comes to love and relationships; her character added a humorous affect.  Also, a relationship built within the church is a concept not too often touched upon and it made for a nice change of reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Crisp and invited addition to contemporary lit	Some might say Bernie and Emma Boudreaux are as different as night and day, but according to Bernie, he and his sister make up two parts of a whole.  Born to a white mother and black father, both children have trouble relating to either parent, but through it all they have each other.  That is until Bernie is in a tragic accident that turns their family and particularly Emma's life upside down.  As the story alternates between the present and both the recent and distant pasts, Emma's story as well as that of the entire Boudreaux family unfolds.<br /><br />Professor Boudreaux is plagued by a past that leaves him with feelings of inadequacy in spite of his professional success.  Through a series of flashbacks we learn about his childhood which is wrought with poverty, loneliness and pain.  His early experiences are replayed in his adult life as he falls into the role of an emotionally distant father and husband.  His son Bernie is a particular thorn in his side because he is always rejecting convention.  Bernie has a learning disability that prevents him from being able to live up to his father's high standards and he is quite aware of his father's disappointment.  Emma on the other hand, does well in school and is the \\"perfect little girl.\\" She is often afraid to express her true feelings and much of her stress is expressed psychosomatically, through recurrent incurable rashes.  Bernie often gives voice to much of what Emma is feeling, but after his accident she has to learn to make it on her own.<br /><br />Through fine writing, excellent characterizations, and alternating points of view, THE PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER poignantly depicts the complicated nature of familial relationships and the unique bond many siblings share.  The characters were complex, yet Raboteau presented them with a clarity that one would expect from a far more seasoned writer.  She didn't tell who the characters were - she allowed them to come alive through her writing and speak for themselves.  At the end of the story, I felt as if I knew the characters, and I understood and empathized with each of them.  Raboteau's writing is a crisp and invited addition to contemporary literature.  For those who love character driven stories, THE PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER will not disappoint.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerslves.

Gallantry at its best	This novel is one in a series entitled \\"The Liar's Club\\", which highlights a group of renegades protecting the Crown.  Celeste Bradley's TO WED A SCANDALOUS SPY is writing at its best.  With this non-conventional setting, Ms. Bradley takes us back to a time when chivalry was standard.

I'm innocent!	Tony Williams, at age 10, witnessed his cousin being murdered by the Ku Klux Klan for his association with a white girl. It colored his life from then on. A former Olympic champion turned football star, Tony Williams is accused of raping a white woman, and it's not just any old white woman off the streets either. It's the daughter of the owner of his team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Marianne Scott approached Tony at an after party in Hawaii while he was extremely drunk, and when he turned her down, she vowed revenge. In a game between the Denver Broncos and the Steelers, Tony takes an illegal hit and is carried off the field on a stretcher. Ned Scott, owner of the Steelers, sends his limo to take Tony home. Marianne weasels her way into the limo with the injured, sleeping Tony. The next morning Tony and his wife discover that Marianne has accused him of rape and battery. His friends from childhood, Adrian and Errol, circle around him and the real horror begins as they attempt to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Whitfield Grant has written an excellent thriller that encompasses the past and the present. The writing is tight, the plot is good and the suspense is downright nerve wracking. I found myself unable to put the book down because I needed to know who did it. Who was helping Marianne with her horrid scheme against this innocent man? At some point, everyone in the book comes under suspicion - from the Klan to the FBI and of course, everyone around Tony. I would definitely recommend this book to thriller lovers. (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Fact or Fiction?	With genetic engineering, eugenics, and stem cell research getting top billing on various newscasts and special news reports, it's not really too unbelievable to think that somewhere in the future, human clones will exist and a few deadly diseases will be cured.  Author Monica R. Payton has taken some of these speculations and mixed them in her new medical thriller CLONING.  Adding a dash of romance, a bit of suspense, a government cover-up, and even the evil villain of all evil villains, the action starts immediately as our main character rushes to get out of the World Trade Center alive during the September 11, 2001 attacks.<br /><br />Dr. Kevin Diamond, a gene therapy physician and surgeon, has created the one thing that would make him famous throughout the world.  He altered human tissue, created his very own clone, and watched him grow for nine years with no apparent side effects.  Financed by the federal government, he is on the verge of producing his own brand of mankind and is confident that they are perfect, just as he sees himself.  Once he makes it safely out of the WTC, he has even more of a focus to mass produce his clones and get them distributed to infertility clinics.  However, there are several big problems.  For one, the research time allotted by the government (over a decade) is gone.  Secondly, other countries are after his research, and thirdly, his partner Aaron, and a former employee are finding out some of his secrets.<br /><br />Aaron is Kevin's identical twin and the \\"good one\\" caught up in worshiping his brother.  He's centered his life around Kevin's dreams and has even taken on a fake identity as not to compete with him.  When things start happening that make him question what type of person Kevin really is, he's not sure which way to turn.  While he does believe in their initial research, he's convinced Kevin has a God-complex and has taken his vanity to another level.  Angela Butler worked for Kevin, but found out about some of his illegal handlings of biomedical products and filed a case against him which she dropped to save the life of a patient who needed him to perform surgery.  She has started her life over, but things take a turn when she runs into Aaron and later find out his connection to Kevin.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the novel quite a bit, there just seemed to be too much going on at times and I wasn't sure which storyline to be more interested in.  Just as I immersed myself with Kevin, Angela popped up; then when I was stuck on her, Aaron would be back.  Some of the scenarios were just a bit drawn out and made the book a much longer read than I felt necessary.  In spite of this, Payton did a masterful job drawing it all together, without the neat bow and it would make an awesome movie.  The characters and their actions were fleshed out, the plots made sense, and the medical jargon and dialogue were not too far above my head to keep me from understanding the book.<br /><br />Payton has successfully melded issues of relevance in the medical community with the lack of constraints fiction provides to present a story that is eye-opening, entertaining, and educational.  What role is the government taking in the advancement of stem cell research and other similar practices?  Are people protected from having their DNA snatched and used to further medical practices?

A Different Love	Through the novel MY HUSBAND'S ON THE DOWNLOW...AND I KNOW ABOUT IT, Janice Scott-Blanton takes readers into the lives of a couple and their very complicated relationship.  James and Annette were high school sweethearts.  Initially drawn to Annette's willingness to accept him unconditionally, James knew early on that they were meant to be.  The couple thrived through the college years in spite of the fact that they attended different universities.  Eventually, they had a child together and were subsequently married.  Around that same time, James began his military career.  Before the couple married, Annette felt compelled to share a nagging secret with her husband-to-be.  This secret, her attraction to other women, would have a marked impact on the path their marriage would take.<br /><br />James and Annette began to explore the swinging lifestyle, locating other women or couples through magazine ads and the Internet and inviting them into their bedroom.  Annette couldn't be happier, she was married to the man of her dreams and he was open enough to not only accept her bi-sexuality, but also to explore and fulfill those sexual urges.  All is well until she discovers that in spite of the open nature of their relationship, James is keeping secrets.  It is then that she begins to question whether or not her husband is bi-sexual and whether their relationship will survive.<br /><br />Janice Scott-Blanton has penned a novel, based on true events, that was both educational and entertaining.  As someone unfamiliar with swinging and some of the alternative lifestyles presented in the book, I often found myself amazed as the story unfolded.  She did an excellent job exploring some of the socio-political issues surrounding homosexuality and bi-sexuality through the characters without sounding preachy or judgmental.  Another real strength in the book was in the character development.  As I read, I felt I knew enough about James and Annette to understand their decisions and behavior.  I would have preferred more dialogue in the story,  and there were times when the transitions between various points of view were too abrupt, but overall this was an interesting read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersnd behavior.

Cinderella Lives in the Hood	I have always loved reading stories about young women who beat the odds of adversity and strife, find their prince charming and live happily ever after.  Ok, I know that's a fairytale, but a girl can dream can't she? After reading GHETTO HEAVEN by Erick S. Gray, I found myself comparing the storyline to that of one my favorite fairytales of all time, Cinderella.  But, Cinderella in the hood?  I know that this may be a stretch of the imagination but think about it.  It could happen. This woman who is still a little girl at heart, really loved the fairytales.<br /><br />Growing up in the hood can be a daily lesson on survival, if you survive.  Toni Benjamin is a young woman who seems to have had more than her fair share of life's struggles.  Her mother is a drug addict who supports her habit by stealing and/or prostitution.  Her older brother is serving a life sentence in prison for killing the man who turned their mother out.  With no one to care for her and teach her the ways of the world, at a very young age, Toni begins her education of life on the streets of Coney Island, Brooklyn.  Her daily concern is earning enough money to take care of her most basic needs.  When she meets very rich and very handsome Matthew Peters, only then does she begin to think about life outside the culture in which she grew up.  Matthew, somewhat disconnected from his world and looking to experience more in life, sees Toni as his lifeline.  But, having been tucked away in his ivory tower on Long Island, he knows nothing about the ghetto or the life Toni lives.  Neither is prepared for the changes that need to happen in order for them to exist together.<br /><br />As they contemplate a relationship, several people stand in the way.  Toni's gangster boyfriend Tec will kill anyone who dares to mess with his turf.  Matthew's domineering fianc&eacute;e and mother will stop at nothing to see that he gets to the altar.  They both work in tandem to keep him close to their vest.  Will Toni turn him out?  Will Toni's coach turn into a pumpkin at midnight with no prince charming?  Will her prince charming even be interested once he finds out the truth?<br /><br />Erick S. Gray has written a very fast-paced, action-filled story about life on Coney Island.  Can you say, page-turner?  It was very hard to put this book down.  I will admit that the language at times was offensive, the killings were brutal, and there were a few grammatical errors to contend with.  But the characters and the overall story kept me enthralled.  Mr. Gray did an excellent job of managing several plots and a huge cast of characters without missing a beat and leaving just enough to hint at a sequel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The Revolution Is On The Comics Page	After six years, the comic strip \\"The Boondocks,\\" the brainchild of the young and talented, Aaron McGruder, is still surrounded by controversy.  The satirical comic strip takes an in your face approach on such topics as Black culture, patriotism, racism and politics.  Some papers have found the comic to be too much and have dropped it from their publication, while others have moved it to the editorial page.  He shares his views through four main characters who represent different aspects of Black identity.  First there's Huey, the young revolutionary, who watches the news, critiques the presidential debates and has an FBI surveillance file.  His younger brother Riley, wants to grow up to be a kingpin,  is a die hard of Hip-Hop culture and wants to be the first person to get away on COPS.  Their grandfather is their primary caregiver and he represents the traditional views of Black culture.  Jazmine, their neighbor is biracial and has identity issues that Huey has no qualms about setting straight<br /><br />McGruder has strong views on the state of our nation and uses the characters of  \\"The Boondocks\\" to speak for him.  Some may not want to read this comic treasury because you may find someone you admire under McGruder's wrath.  Everyone from the President of the United States on down to the Hip-Hop star of the moment is subject to be the topic under fire, he holds no punches.  With this third collection, McGruder showcases some of his best work. The comic has an underlying message and it's delivery is hilarious.  I laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks and my sides hurt.  I love Aaron McGruder's wit and his courage to continue to produce his work under the scrutiny of his many critics.  If you really want to know what I am raving about I suggest you pick up a copy of A RIGHT TO BE HOSTILE.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Sizzling Sex	SCANDALOUS is a tale of how one man who is on top of the world can cause so much drama in a small country town.  Charles Jennings is a pillar of society in Senatobia, Mississippi.  He is a deacon in the church, a member of a successful gospel group and appears to be a loving family man.  Problem is, Charles has his hands full with marriage and his need to have mistresses; and we are not talking one or two either.  Even when his second marriage ends due to his philandering, the need or greed for sex never diminishes.  When a revengeful vow from the grave threatens Charles, he still continues on his path of debauchery.<br /><br />With the possibility of Charles' lust, deceit and betrayal threatening to be revealed, the people of the small town must also deal with their own shortcomings, guilt and vengeance.  When the conjecture starts to surface, no one is immune including Charles' preacher, family and friends.  Like a domino effect, the town's folk know their own individual indiscretions may come to light, and therein lies the drama.<br /><br />ReChella has written a scandalous, lusty and provocative story.  SCANDALOUS is filled and overflowing with sex and drama.  Although the story is a page turner, it is not being motivated by a strong plot or full character development.  The flow of the novel is created by scintillating sexual trysts that would keep any reader interested, even if the plot is weak.  Opportunities to make the story stronger are ignored and replaced with sexy scenes and drama.  The depth of Charles' character is not fully explored therefore I could not fully understand why Charles is not able to be faithful or why he has a need to have so many wives.  And for most of the characters, we are given only a glimpse of their personalities, not their whole story.  Also, the vow from the grave was not fully developed and I feel it would have strengthened the plot. Yet, readers who love drama and hot, sexy love scenes will definitely find this novel tempting if not just plain scandalous.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersting if not just plain scandalous.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-04-09
Being True to Self	SCRUB MATCH was filled with many depictions of everyday life: relationships, friendships, domestic violence and parenting.  Although a gay/lesbian book, the storyline gave a clear view on similar incidents that occur within male/female relationships, reactions from parents when an individual decides to come out of the \\"closet\\" and the fear from within that everyone carries around sometime during their lives.  It moved a little slow at times, but this did not detract from the messages the author was trying to convey.

The Forgotten	Homeless people are dying in Lincoln Prairie, Illinois and the big question is does anybody care? Since they are considered the invisible people in society, one less doesn't make a difference. Detectives Marti MacAlister and Vik Jessenovik believe that everyone, regardless of their social standing, deserves justice and are on the case. However, they are running up against a major obstacle in working the case; their overzealous boss has them on a short leash and everything they do is being scrutinized.<br /><br />Lieutenant Gail Nicholson rules with an iron fist and everything is done by the book. Her rules are law and violators will be punished to the fullest extent. As an African-American woman, she is determined to move quickly and efficiently up the chain of command, so she only takes cases that she feels will make her shine. When a series of homeless murders begin to plague Lincoln Prairie, Lt. Nicholson insists that MacAlister and Jessenovik wrap things up as quickly and quietly as possible. She doesn't really feel that the homeless are worthy of the time and money an extensive investigation might cost. In addition to all of this Nicholson sees Marti as a threat because she is a well-respected, popular, black female detective, and Nicholson intends to make her life a living hell.<br /><br />Besides a serial killer, Detective MacAlsiter has other problems. Her best friend's deranged ex-husband, Devonte Lutrell, has revenge on his mind. He blames Marti for ruining his life. Devonte's ultimate goal is to kill Marti, and if anyone gets in the way of that goal, they are as good as dead.<br /><br />A COLD AND SILENT DYING is a story filled with suspense, hate, hubris and compassion. Marti MacAlister is completely dedicated to her job, but at the same time her family is her most important work. Her love for them often gets her through a difficult case. Author Eleanor Taylor Bland has a way of making her character's strong but vulnerable, and she often allows readers into the minds of her characters' I love her writing style; however, in this story, I was disappointed by the ending.

Love and Loneliness	Loneliness has a way of creeping up on you.  When you least expect it, it pops up like a bad penny; often making you reflect on your life to see how you became so lonely.  That reflection often involves looking around at family and friends who all seem to have found that elusive happiness; but somewhere along the way you were left out either by choice or by circumstance.  In CHERISHED by Adrienne Ellis Reeves we examine the lives of two individuals as they reconcile and come to terms with their loneliness.<br /><br />Hurt and feeling inadequate from a failed marriage, Nerissa Ramsey is looking to begin a new life for herself in Jamison, South Carolina.  Her search for a place to live leads her to Bill Denton, a local photographer with a place for rent.  Although the two pick each other apart mentally and verbally at first, the attraction is there simmering just beneath the surface as the rental agreement is negotiated.  The rental, which happens to be next door to Bill's home, keeps them in constant close proximity of each other; but misunderstandings keep them miles apart on a deeper level.<br /><br />It's nice to read a love story that is neither too complicated nor filled with heavy sex scenes.  Ms. Reeves has written such a book.  The story was simple, sweet and unblemished without the need for tawdry sex.  The only thing complicated in this book was the two main characters' reaction to one another.  They showed us just how easily miscommunication could play at discouraging a budding relationship if left unchecked.  This was a book that I could easily share with my teenage niece and not worry about the message she would get from reading it.  (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Embracing the past	With characters ranging from preachers to con-artists, Paul<br /><br />Lawrence Dunbar shows glimpses of the lives of African Americans<br /><br />after the Civil War in a sleepy southern town called Happy Hollow.<br /><br />Using the folksy language indicative of that era, along with mental<br /><br />snapshots of our forgotten communities, he shares a historic<br /><br />collection of perceptive tales filled with laughter, and saturated<br /><br />with tears.<br /><br />First published in 1904, THE HEART OF HAPPY HOLLOW features sixteen<br /><br />engaging short stories. Dunbar peppers this collection with  some<br /><br />colorful characters and a group of unique men and women who give<br /><br />voice to these timeless themes. One story reminds readers of the<br /><br />adage, the more things change, the more they stay the same. It is an<br /><br />amusing story of a father and son who adamantly share different<br /><br />views about life and religion. Does that not sound like today? And<br /><br />on an opposing end of the pen there is a heart-wrenching story<br /><br />about the lynching of Jube Benson.<br /><br />As noted on the back cover, Dunbar's work has deservedly experienced a<br /><br />recent revival among commercial and scholarly audiences. Paul Lawrence<br /><br />Dunbar has written a captivating book which should give example to<br /><br />the craft of storytelling. A step ahead of much of the literary world,<br /><br />he gives readers nineteenth-century literature that is second to none.<br /><br />To reacquaint yourself with post Civil War life, pick up a copy THE<br /><br />HEART OF HAPPY HOLLOW, it is an excellent read.

Her chosen task is not without risk or pain; she has lost several friends due to fearlessness.

Where Will Fate Take You	FATE'S REDEMPTION tells the story of three brothers, Jericho, Sterling, and William Wise.  Jericho, the oldest brother could on some levels be considered the black sheep of the family, but in reality, he is also a fierce guardian angel.  After many years of illegal moneymaking through the buying and selling of illegal drugs and weaponry, he has established contacts in high-level U.S. Government officials, the banking industry and with other \\"powers-that-be\\" throughout the world.  He uses his wealth and connections to protect his family, helping them, often from afar, realize their dreams.  Jericho and his wife are extremely dedicated to one another, but they are also extremely violent, unafraid to kill or be killed in order to protect their loved ones.<br /><br />Sterling, a prominent attorney, is the Don Juan of the family.  He often provides legal advice and representation for his brothers, and more importantly, his sense of humor is always a source of comic relief.  He flees from commitment, always looking for a new woman to bed and send on her way.  On the day he wins the biggest case of his life, he is handed a dismissal from the law firm for which he works.  With no job, he is forced to re-evaluate his life and try to figure out whether or not he is ready to branch out on his own.  When a wealthy benefactor promises him the success he is looking for, he has to decide whether the strings attached to the deal are worth it.<br /><br />William's story is at the heart of the book.  He is a widowed psychologist with a thriving practice.  After years of attraction, one of his employees, Dr. Terry Moretti, expresses her romantic interest.  In spite of his attraction, William is apprehensive about starting a relationship with her because she is white.  As a result of a series of heated discussions with some members of his staff about race issues in the United States and more intimate talks with Terry, he is forced to re-examine his own attitudes and behaviors.  He decides to pursue the relationship and what ensues is a tumultuous and at times tragic tale of love, loss and fate.<br /><br />Author Keith Lee Johnson bills this book as his most controversial yet, and with his hard-hitting examination of race and in particular interracial relationships, I wouldn't disagree.  Unfortunately, at times it seemed as if he put so much energy into demonstrating a point, that the characters and their stories were overshadowed.  William's story got so bogged down in politics that I found myself hoping that the author would hurry and return to Sterling or Jericho's story.  While I am sure there are some people who may disagree with a lot of the points about racist views that blacks have towards whites, I didn't dislike the book because of its message.  My problem with this aspect of the story is that I wanted the author to demonstrate his points through the lives and experiences of the characters; to show rather than tell.  William's protracted monologues about various issues of race coupled with Terry's incessant need to talk about why black women had issues with black men dating white women got tedious after a while and took away from their story.  Also, in spite of the lengthiness of the book, I felt that certain aspects of the plot, especially Sterling's story, were either rushed or left hanging.  Still, I enjoyed the book, especially the scenes that highlighted the family dynamics and sibling relationships.  FATE'S REDEMPTION is the kind of book you want to read with someone else or in a book club because it offers a lot of food for thought and discussion.

Retribution...	Denise Campbell has written MAN KILLER as a means of sharing, helping others heal, and breaking the silence usually accompanied by sexual abuse.  Four women, calling themselves \\"Man Killers,\\" have decided to rid the world of \\"bad\\" men -- men who have forced themselves on women and children, raping them of not only their right to say no, but taking away a part of their souls.  Cathalina Shekhar is a psychiatrist and recruiter for the group.  Serena is a judge by day, and by night she fights the hatred embedded within her, all revolving around men and the power they exert over their victims.  Cleopatra is the gatekeeper of the group and serves to protect them; she runs a whorehouse.  Elizabeth is a beautiful actress, but hiding the fact that she's a hermaphrodite and trying to deal with her unusual desires.  The women form a unique bond as they prepare to get total vengeance to right the wrongs of society.<br /><br />They have gone through the initiation process and been injected with deadly poisons of various spiders and think they've found their leader, the \\"Spider Queen,\\" in Serena.  One of Cathalina's patients will serve as the fifth and final team member, putting all their plans in full motion.  Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned.  Instead a cycle of chaos is started that leads back to the Man Killers and a decade of unsolved deaths in Chicago.  When Detective Minto flies in from Atlanta, tracking down Elizabeth, things get a bit out of control, and a new player is introduced into the game.<br /><br />Though definitely different than what I'm accustomed to reading in African-American literature, I enjoyed MAN KILLER.  Campbell's creativity ushers the reader through the story, enabling them to witness the horrific details, experience the bond of the women, and understand just how far a person is willing to go to avenge the wrongs done to them.  Unfortunately, the book is riddled with typographical, grammatical, and structural errors which take away from the story. At various times I had to re-read portions to find out exactly what the author intended to say, causing me to lose the fluidness that comes with reading.  I hope these editorial flaws will be fixed in future printings, because this story deserves to be read by all audiences.<br /><br />Despite the strong sexual content, the unlikely possibility of man killers existing in real life, and the editorial problems, the message in MAN KILLER shines through crystal clear.  Women are being victimized and left to suffer through the shame, hurt, and pain inflicted upon them by their attackers.<br /><br />Please be advised that this book is not for the faint of heart.  With scenes of bestiality, lesbian relations, animal-like transformations, and the like, this book may not be appropriate for those under the age of eighteen.  MAN KILLER is not your average read, no denying that, but I would encourage its use as a tool to better understand some of the ins and outs of sexual abuse and the affects on a person's psyche. Unfortunately, the victim can easily turn into a victimizer, psychopath, or worse... losing themselves in the process.  (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Who am I?	Craig Hickman, an adopted child, decides he wants to know who his birth parents are. After a long and arduous search, Craig locates his mother Jennifer who was forced by her mother to give him up at birth. Craig discovers that he has twin sisters, aunts, uncles and a grandmother who rules the clan. At various functions, the adopted family, the birth family and Craig's husband, get together to learn more about each other.<br /><br />Mr. Hickman has written a stunning memoir about what it means to be an adopted child searching for his roots. He uses many styles of writing to help us not only understand his feelings, but to be there with him. In one chapter, when he has finally discovered his birth family and is going to contact them, he uses stream of consciousness very effectively so that his angst, fear and happiness shine through as his thoughts meld onto the page. Poignant poetry is another method used by Mr. Hickman to bring readers into his world. Letters written to his new family also give us an inside track to his real thoughts and feeling.<br /><br />While discovering his roots is the main thesis of the book, Craig also covers many other subjects such as homosexuality, marital issues, problems with in-laws and family love, as well as family discord. It is a book well worth reading more than once.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Talk About Drama	If you want to experience some drama, read DRAMA FACTOR by Wanda M. Toby.  The action starts off at full tilt.  A woman has just been released from prison, having served three of a five-year sentence for beating up a man.  A well-known professional football player is being chased out of an apartment via the fire escape by his girlfriend's husband; a man he found out about just moments earlier.  A doctor is out on a blind date that her mother has set up, only to find out he is the date from hell, and she literally has to run for her life. And folks, that's just in the first ten pages of this book.<br /><br />Grace Watson is an osteopathic doctor who has just escaped from the ultimate bad blind date.  She flees to a local Waffle House to regroup and think about what she'll tell her sister once she gets home.  For she knows that her sister, Rachel, who is fresh out of prison has a serious attitude about men, and will hunt him down if she has to.  Then, down plops handsome Xavier Jean Françoise, the infamous X-Factor of the Atlanta Falcons, and Grace is completely clueless to his identity.  Xavier is also scampering away from a bad situation.  He is hoping that he's ditched the husband of his recent fling.  Unable to get Xavier to leave her booth, the two strangers share a few moments of conversation, contemplation, and attraction.  Although intrigued by one another, past relationships and deep hurts keep the two from even sharing their names as they go their separate ways.<br /><br />Well the two don't take into account Rachel's flair for being a meddlesome sister or Xavier's matchmaking mother and sister.  When the opportunity presents itself, the three capitalize on it to aide in bringing some love into the lives of their precious family members.  Once they get Grace and Xavier together, they all stand back and watch love take its natural course.  The drama gets kicked up a notch when outside sources intervene to derail what appears to be a relationship bound for matrimonial bliss.<br /><br />We all have the tendency to sensationalize the lives of those who live at the upper echelon of the income scale.  We sometimes think that they are beyond the normal everyday grind that affects those of us who are classified in the middle and low-income classes.  But, Ms. Toby quickly points out drama has no boundaries.  It doesn't matter if you are a doctor, a professional football player, or someone who works a regular nine to five job, drama will follow you.  Money, stardom, and success are some of the traits that will attract the excitement that breeds unwanted attention.  And in many cases, it comes just because.  I felt the author did an excellent job of incorporating her Haitian background and humanizing the life of a professional athlete to provide a refreshing variation in this book.

True love knows no dress size...	For many years, every heroine in every romance novel was petite in nature, and even though most of the stories were good, for women of substance it was a little hard to relate.  So needless to say, as a full-figured woman myself, I was overjoyed (just as I was when I found out there were novels that were written by people of my race, who featured people of my race) when I found out that several of the top names in the romance genre finally heeded the calls of big, but beautiful, women everywhere.<br /><br />First there was the anthology Living Large, followed by A Whole Lotta Love, and now in BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY, we are introduced to four more voluptuous vixens who are the epitome of elegance and grace, and who have men who desire them, no matter what their size.  Each contributing author has written stories that are positive in nature, but also touch briefly on the doubts and insecurities heavier people tend to face (thanks to the negative stereotypes often portrayed in the media).  Of course it goes without saying that each story is sensuous and very romantic.  Whether you're a \\"big girl\\" or not, you're sure to enjoy this latest full-figured anthology.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Lifestyle - at what cost?	Travis Burns has it all - a wonderful job as a programmer and two equally smart best friends.  He's quite the eligible bachelor, handsome and by society's standards, fine as hell.  Life is at a point where it just couldn't get any better, until the system forces him out of a job and he decides to take his knowledge to the streets to cash in.<br /><br />No matter what, Jackie always has Travis' back.  She's secretly in love with him, but also has a penchant for women.  As she, too, suffers from the recent recession, her only desire is to make money, and keep money.  An excellent chemist, she realizes too late that nothing is written in stone and corporate America takes no prisoners.  With her two friends in tow, Jackie is down for whatever.<br /><br />Ronnie is the third leg of the crew.  The hothead and slow thinker of the group, his main goal in life is to be a baller, and the best at it.  After losing his cushy Wall Street job, he doesn't care what they do, as long as it will keep him in his current lifestyle, at all costs.<br /><br />With a sweet hook-up from a big-time hustler, they devise a plan to make money like no one's business; but at what cost?  After being in this lifestyle for two years, the robbing game is not cool anymore to Travis; he's been thinking about getting out.  To make matters worse, he's finally found the one woman that can make him dump the lifestyle for good.  The only question is: will she leave before that time?  The pact these three made has lasted for years, but sometimes, you need to get out while it's good or suffer the consequences.<br /><br />M.O.B was interesting, but left me feeling as if there was more to be said.  Roy reached back into his previous book to add characters that fans of his would be familiar with.  But, there were quite a few typographical errors, which at times detracted from the storyline.  While M.O.B. shed some light on the \\"game\\" and the interior dealings of this lifestyle, for me, it lacked the individuality that would help set it apart from other urban fiction books currently on the market.  If you're into this genre, it's sure to keep you captivated.

They Would Never Hurt the Kids...	BREAKING THE CYCLE is a compelling collection of shorts stories about the subject of domestic violence.  Zane, the editor of the collection, has gathered a diverse group of contributing authors who each brought something unique to their offering.  The book discusses different types of abuse, from physical to emotional, verbal to sexual, but has a special emphasis on the impact of domestic violence on children.<br /><br />I honestly enjoyed every story in this collection; however, some are particularly noteworthy.  Young author, J.L. Woodson's story captured the voice of his 12 year-old protagonist with such simple honesty that I couldn't help but empathize.  Woodson also laced a bit of fantasy into the tale which made the story unique and a pleasure to read in spite of the dark subject matter.  Nane Quartay's contribution was another that was told from a child's point of view.  His vivid characterizations made me feel like I was right on the block watching the story unfold.  Shonda Cheekes' story focused on a male victim of domestic violence and in it she highlights the stigma and shame that are unique to men.  Zane and Tracy Price-Thompson's stories featured characters who have simply had enough.  While I didn't mention the other authors by name, trust me when I say each story is unique, well-written, and will make you think.<br /><br />Reading BREAKING THE CYCLE made me appreciate the choices I made in choosing a mate.  However, for those who may be in an abusive relationship, it provides useful information and will remind victims that they are not alone.  In addition, this is a wonderful book for young adults, who lack experience when it comes to relationships.  It provides realistic examples of how a seemingly good relationship can take a dramatic turn for the worse.  Further, it serves as a reminder that domestic violence doesn't occur in a vacuum; it impacts the entire family and the broader community.  I highly commend Zane for putting together a collection of stories that are not only well-written and emotional, but also address a very important social issue.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerson of stories that are not only well-written and emotional, but also address a very important social issue. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br /> <br />	2005-04-09
Breath of fresh air	Readers who enjoy romance novels relish in stories that exemplify the beauty of love with strong characters and a dynamic plot.  WITH EVERY BREATH is one novel that romance lovers will definitely enjoy.  This story not only brings two destined characters together, but there is the added bonus of suspense to keep readers enthralled to the very end.<br /><br />Imani Maxwell is a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park on her way to tenure at her alma mater.  She is very compassionate about African-American literature, which is seen in her teachings and her interactions with her students.  However, her love life is not fairing as well as her career endeavors.  Her relationship with her brother's best friend is going no where, and she doesn't know exactly how to end it.  When she meets FBI Agent Garrison Wade after one of her students is kidnapped, she begins to question her ability to follow the mandate of her deceased father, which was to not get involved with an FBI Agent.  Will she follow her heart?<br /><br />Garrison Wade is passionate about his job and the victims he tries to save on each of his missions.  When he meets Imani, the passion he has for his job is conveyed to her.  Even with this high profile kidnapping case, Garrison can't seem to take his mind off Imani.  However, he must break down her barriers in order for them to become one.  And when the person who kidnapped Imani's student makes her the next target, Garrison will stop at nothing to protect and claim Imani as his.<br /><br />Maureen Smith has written a novel that will keep readers on the edge of their seat with a suspenseful story that is enveloped in fiery romance.  Her characters are complex, but strong, as well as unique and realistic.  The storyline was well-developed and kept me guessing until the very end.  Although this is a lengthy romance, not once did I find the 426 pages a deterrent.  In fact, it just gave me more time to relish in the developing relationship of the main characters.

Compton takes the insistent cadences of jazz and<br /><br />hip-hop and fuses them with language, history and contemporary<br /><br />Black politics.

Why African Americans should receive reparations	The authors of THE DOMINO EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND DISCRIMINATION make a solid case for reparations for African Americans. They start with the arrival of the first slaves upon this continent and take us all the way to the present day, explaining that America's wealth was built upon the free labor of African slaves. It didn't stop with the Emancipation either but continued through another 100 years of segregation and discrimination. For instance, blacks were freed but freed only to work as tenant farmers and sharecroppers, usually paying the owner of the land more than they made growing the crops. Because there were no laws of fair play or regulation, the white owners could charge them whatever they wanted for the 'privilege' of working their land. In addition, blacks were not permitted to buy houses where they wished or otherwise amass the same wealth that white Americans were amassing. This went on until the civil rights legislations of the 1950s and 1960s. Whites also killed, burned out and lynched blacks at will thus obtaining for themselves whatever wealth the blacks had acquired. Rosewood, Florida and Tulsa, Oklahoma were among those cities that were mention where entire black neighborhoods were burned. The government refused to give blacks protection by passing anti-lynching bills or even prosecuting the attacking whites.<br /><br />THE DOMINO EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND DISCRIMINATION was a very interesting and informative book that gives us plenty of history lessons as well as justification for demanding reparations. Cheeks and Brown urge us to ignore the \\"get over it\\" arguments and list many examples where the US has paid reparations such as to the Japanese American citizens who were unjustly incarcerated during World War Two and reparations paid to Jewish Holocaust survivors. It's just African Americans that the government wants to ignore. They offer many ways the reparations can be paid. They also suggest that the government put an immediate halt to the discrimination that still goes on.

A Spiritual Journey	The story of Joseph in the Bible is a very popular and powerful one with all its connotations and possible life applications.  Joseph's struggle through life after his brothers threw him in a pit and then later sold him into slavery has implications for all of us dealing with the likes of jealousy, sibling rivalry, parental love, forgiveness, faith and hope.  Diane Proctor Reeder has taken that story and charted Joseph's life alongside that of her family's struggle with a life and death situation in A DIARY OF JOSEPH, A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY THROUGH TIME.<br /><br />Ms. Reeder uses poetry and a little narration to compare the similarities between Joseph's struggles and her family's battle with leukemia.  At the onset, it would appear that the two were not the same, but this carefully plotted spiritual journal boldly marks all of the similarities.  The book was set up in chapters that fully explored all the different stages that Joseph and this family went through in their journey.  She even gives a look at her conversations with God.  My favorite chapters were The Pit and The Bottom, in which Reeder compares the pit and the jail Joseph was thrown into to the pit her family entered with the initial diagnosis of leukemia for her husband.  If you can imagine how Joseph must've felt alone in that dark pit or the jail waiting for God to do something, then imagine how it must have felt to have the man you love, one day healthy and the next dealing with a possible life-threatening disease and then waiting for God to deliver him.  The feelings explored were deep despair, fear, anxiety and hope.<br /><br />For such a small book, A DIARY OF JOSEPH packs a really big spiritual punch for everyone.  The lesson I learned from these pages is that no matter how deep your pit of despair, there is something better that God is working out.  We build spiritual muscle when we're going through and learning to depend on God.  We just have to keep an open dialogue with Him and remember that He alone is the author and finisher of our lives.  Not being a big reader of poetry, I must interject that this was a well-crafted book in which each poem really spoke to me on a level that I could understand and relate.  I would recommend anyone in need of a spiritual lift, particularly if you're facing a crisis, to please read this book.

Getting revenge or getting over it?	Who hasn't been wronged before and contemplated avenging themselves? Normally the person will plot, scheme, or debate on how to get even or exact a plan that will inflict some type of punishment on whomever or whatever was responsible for their hurt, humiliation, or failure.  ACT OF VENGEANCE is one of four books in the thriller series by literary newcomer Millicent Y. Hodge.  She utilizes her background working on political campaigns and in the White House to give the reader a behind-the-scenes view of political happenings.<br /><br />Four people are on \\"The List\\" and all of them are expected to be aboard Air Force Two, the Vice-President's plane, as it lands in New York City.  Escorted by six F-16 fighter jets, the plane explodes and crashes into the landing strip at JFK International Airport.  It is assumed that all the passengers are dead; yet, witnesses report seeing a parachute in the sky minutes after the plane goes down.  FBI Director Charles Thomas was supposed to be aboard Air Force Two, but misses his flight, which ultimately saves his life.  Once he arrives on the scene of the crash, he heads up the investigation to find out exactly what happened.  Search parties are sent out to recover pieces of the plane as well as the missing bodies, which include the Vice-President, Richard Spaulding.<br /><br />At the reading of his will, three women are present: his wife, his mother, and his college sweetheart.  It's apparent that each woman has some stake in his inheritance, but when they continually turn up at the same place, at the same time, it becomes a mystery to Thomas on what their connection really is. Did any of them actually love the VP or are they only out for what they can get financially?  Add in a recently arrested former Deputy Attorney General who has been found guilty of his crime, who leads the FBI around dropping clues, yet everyone knows he was in prison at the time of the plane crash.  Exactly who is out to get who in ACT OF VENGEANCE?<br /><br />I loved this story and enjoyed the suspense, the action, and the romance involved.  Hodge has done a remarkable job of allowing the reader to see the events as they unfold for the characters.  In addition, she's melded issues of concern in politics and society, as well as focusing on how the past can affect the future.

I highly recommend this book for all mystery lovers.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Getting through the storm	Rachel Loftin grew up with success on her mind.  Meeting and falling in love with David Morin wasn't exactly her plan, but when it happened, she embraced it wholeheartedly.  Going through the years with her husband seemed to be the pinnacle of her life, until she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Suddenly, the world as she once knew it came crashing down around her, especially when the husband she so dearly loved shut her out as if SHE were the disease.<br /><br />Ironically, after her divorce, Rachel finds out that she never had breast cancer, but was misdiagnosed.  Feeling empty and alone, she leaves everything and everyone dear to her in California in an effort to \\"find\\" her true self.  Stumbling to Rosedale, the home of her father, Rachel begins to learn that when life throws you punches, you don't have to fall down.<br /><br />Meeting someone new was never her intent; self-love was the main goal.  While listening to the town's history, she also learns about a love story and family feud that spans across generations.  With this new knowledge, and a new love interest, Rachel sees life through a different pair of eyes.<br /><br />HALF MOON, FULL HEART is a wonderfully woven tale of self-appreciation, true love at its finest and rebirth.  With its colorful, rich, fairytale-like essence, this is sure to have you either getting a tissue or jumping for joy.  Gene Cartwright has outdone himself with this novel, which is not just African-American literature, but a fine crossover in literary genre.  If you're ever in the market for something different, this is a sure read that won't disappoint.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Don't forget to count	Life lands some hard blows, but it's up to us to recognize a blessing when it's coming.  Pat, the owner of the hair salon Blessings, has her work cut out for her.  With a business she's sure is destined to be a flop, she's on the verge of missing out.  Not to mention she's got some serious hang-ups, and why shouldn't she?  She only has a husband most women long for; handsome, financially stable and groomed to primp and pamper his wife like a queen.  Now, the real question - what is the problem???<br /><br />Zuma, known around town as the \\"diva of hair,\\" has her own motto: Can't stop, won't stop.  Thinking that she's doing Pat a favor, she comes to work at Blessings, only to find something she didn't bargain on: true friendship.

After being forced to deal with dramatic lifestyle changes, Faye's strong bonds with her co-workers help to get her on her way.<br /><br />Sandy is a true round-the-way girl.  Problem is, she's white and is constantly ridiculed by the sistahs, even though she grew up in an all-black neighborhood.  Always living her life in the shadows of someone else or major disappointments, Sandy doesn't know how to live life as it should be.  Strapped with two children she never even wanted, she's thrown into a harsh situation that has spun out of control.  Fighting to keep her own sanity amongst every one else's drama, she's forced into a situation that helps mold her into who she really is.<br /><br />Sheneska Jackson has done a wonderful job of emulating what blessings really are.

BLESSINGS captivates the mind and warms the soul through engaging dialogue and down-to-earth situations.  The best part: it shows you that no matter what you're going through and no matter how hard your struggle - hold on, because when you least expect it, your blessing is coming.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewersa Jackson has done a wonderful job of emulating what blessings really are.

Erotic tales...	Erotica is defined as art or literature intended to arouse sexual desire.<br />--Dictionary.com<br /><br />Readers of erotica are looking for those stories that stoke the fires of desire and catapult them into fantasies only to be lived out within the pages of a hot erotic story or compilation.  Author K has written twenty-six short stories to engage readers in some erotic wants.  WALKIN' PUSSY will illicit plenty of sexy images and fantasies.<br /><br />Each of the stories is very distinctive, but not all will conjure up sexual desires.  However, most of the stories were well-written and I liked the author's ability to make each story different with storylines, time periods and their endings.  I found I enjoyed the stories that were a bit longer and didn't dwell completely on the sexual act; those stories contained foreplay.  Recognizing that fantasies can be different for each individual, I was somewhat taken aback with a few stories which were not erotic.  The fantasy element was over-the-top, not crude, but just not to my liking.  WALKIN' PUSSY is an assorted compilation of erotic tales from a writer who has a varied imagination and readers should be able to find something to satisfy their erotic cravings.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
From Servant to Immortal	MASTER is not your run of the mill vampire novel. For one, its timeline begins during slavery in the Antebellum South. Additionally, one of the leading vampires is transformed from a young slave girl into an immortal bloodsucker, and lastly, the story centers as much on secondary, less dead characters as it does the \\"back cover protagonists\\".<br /><br />Growing up on a plantation and knowing little of the outside world, Lila, a beautiful young slave girl, meets what some would call tragedy, and what others would call Alex, on a fateful night in the forest. Alex has good looks, charm, yet he still has an evil side. Oh, and he just happens to be a vampire. After this rugged introduction, Lila's life presumably changes dramatically. Alex was created by one of the O.V.'s - the original vampires, and Lila has no idea just what she is bargaining for. In addition to these undead characters, Sally, Lila's \\"aunt\\" from the plantation, Tobias, once known as the sheriff, and a cast of other characters enter the picture to steal the readers' hearts and add a dose of humanity to this otherwise horrific tale.<br /><br />While I wasn't blown away by it, I enjoyed the journey that MASTER provided to me, and I certainly wouldn't tout this as simply a vampire novel. Although the writing seemed a little choppy and disconnected in places, the characters held it together with their appeal and their stories, and, most notably, their love for each other. The passionate, needful love between Lila and Alex is a steady force, and they are as romantic and ardent as any two vampires could be. In addition, the familial love between Sally and Lila is strong and unconditional, and not once does it falter. While other love stories abound within the plot, these two relationships touched me the most. Perhaps a fitting moniker for this type of book would be something to the effect of \\"Historical Family Vampire Romance\\".

Fanning the flames...	It has been many years since Lucien Ballard and Thais Parker did the unthinkable...got married in Las Vegas after only knowing each other for a few days.  When the sensual fog, and the alcohol induced haze, cleared the next morning, Thais realized she may have made a big mistake.  So without a word to Lucien, she took off and had the marriage annulled.  Fast forward fifteen years to the present, and Lucien and Thais run into each other again in Lucien's hometown.  Sparks fly, unresolved hurts arise, and the love they felt for each other so many years ago consumes them once again.<br /><br />Betttye Griffin has created yet another wonderful love story in WHERE THERE'S SMOKE.  The familial relationships between the characters were real and not overly dramatic.  The romance was strong and pure, making one believe in love at first sight.  I truly enjoyed this book, and encourage all romance readers everywhere to pick up a copy.

Speak to my heart...	There is nothing sweeter, outside of the love of God, than a loving relationship with the one who makes your heart flutter and your pulse race just by looking at them.  To love and be loved...oh what a wondrous feeling.  In HOW SWEET THE SOUND, authored by highly acclaimed authors Jacquelin Thomas, Francis Ray and Felicia Mason, we are introduced to six individuals who find love when they least expect it, and for one couple, a second chance at love.<br /><br />As a huge fan of both the romance and Christian fiction genres, this combination of both really touched my heart.  Each author's story was heartfelt, heartwarming, and a beautiful testament to true love.  They were romantic without being sappy, and even though the novel is faith based, it is not preachy, but the underlying message of waiting on and believing in God for all things is apparent and speaks volumes.  HOW SWEET THE SOUND has already been added to my list of all-time favorites.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Just Because	\\"Honey Baby Sugar Child, Lord knows I love you so.\\" This is the simple first line that begins HONEY BABY SUGAR CHILD, a wonderful book that celebrates the love a mother has for her child.  The warm and inviting illustrations mirror the sentiments of the storyline and help maintain interest.  In a nutshell, the book is filled with various expressions of love that are realistic and full of emotion.<br /><br />This book has become a part of a daily reading ritual with my toddler.  Sometimes he turns the pages as I read and other times we act out some of the scenes.  As a mother of a boy, I really appreciate the fact that the child in the book is male; however, the story will appeal to readers of either gender.  The story reminds parents of the importance of telling their children they are loved unconditionally, while maintaining a timbre that makes the book just plain fun to read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09

Who's in charge and why?	Norman Kelley has taken on black leadership in America and attempted to expose its delicate underbelly. He accuses them of missing the point when it comes to what the black populace needs in order to succeed in this country. Kelley feels especially hostile toward those he labels the \\"niggerati\\" (a term coined by Zora Neal Hurston) who are the black intellectuals. Cornell West, Michael Eric Dyson, bell hooks, and Henry Lewis Gates all take something of a beating at his capable hands. He states that they are able to \\"dazzle the white world with their mixture of \\"street\\" analysis and postmodern argot.\\" I get the distinct impression he thinks that dealing with the hip hop generation is merely a way for them to keep their names in the news while not really saying or doing anything helpful.<br /><br />While many of his comments are on the mark, he doesn't explain just what black leadership should do to effectively help the common people. He doesn't discuss the issues that the black leaders themselves face in that they are not welcome at the American table - either as politicians or as leaders of a people the white American leadership would prefer to ignore. I feel that he omitted the many roadblocks that have faced black leaders from DuBois to Sharpton. It's almost as if he's suggesting that if black leaders did x, y, or z differently, then the problems would be solved, while totally leaving out the racism that caused them in the first place.

Getting Yours	Is it possible to overcome shady behavior?  Well in STILL SHEISTY: PART 2 by T. N. Baker, the sequel to Sheisty, we learn if it's likely.  Epiphany Wright, Keisha Moore and Shana Scott continue their drama-filled lives from book one. Because of her gold-digging ways, Epiphany finds herself near death and a close friend actually dead.  When she awakens from her coma, she doesn't remember what happened which is a good thing for a gangster named C-God and his partner Ness because they are the ones responsible.  If Epiphany remembers, their best bet will be for the cops to get them first because street justice can be a killer.<br /><br />Keisha does the unthinkable due to loneliness.  She has it all: a nice job, a beautiful home, a child, and a man who would do anything for her, but she tosses it away for a brief romp in the sack that was unfortunately caught on tape.  But was it really her fault? Or did she have some help from the little green-eyed monster?<br /><br />With her man, K. C., fresh out of the joint, Shana is doing her thing and keeping it real while making some money.  But she has a secret and is praying K. C. doesn't find out.  Sadly, someone else wants a piece of her action and is willing to blackmail her to get it.  What price is she willing to pay to keep it a secret?<br /><br />This was definitely a page-turner from beginning to end.  Ms. Baker did an excellent job capturing enough details from the first book so that STILL SHEISTY could stand alone.  The drama was so thick that I found myself caught up in the lives of the main characters from the get go.  This book was about what goes around comes around.  Each of the main characters taught a lesson about the choices we make and the repercussions that follow. You may be getting yours now, but, in the end, there is a price to pay.  Although I enjoyed the action-packed, drama-filled pages, I felt some fine-tuning was needed in the editing department.  There were enough typographical and grammatical errors to make this a distracting read at times.  Despite that, this is one book I'm sure will be a big hit with the hip-hop generation.

Getting Paid...Is It Worth The Trouble?	Wifebeater is a term no woman wants to hear.  It conjures up vivid pictures of women who succumbed to physical and verbal abuse at the hands of very callous mates.  When I picked up my copy of WIFEBEATER by Mister Mann Frisby, my first reaction was, \\"here we go, another fictional dialogue on the demise of the institution of marriage at the hands of domestic abuse, but with an urban drama twist.\\"  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  And furthermore, wifebeater meant nowhere near what I thought it did.  And don't ask, I'm not telling.  You gotta read the book.<br /><br />Sticks, a single, out-of-work dad has two concerns: take care of his daughter and keep custody of her.  Wondering how he will be able to keep his apartment, feed the two of them and get Brie an education, it is little wonder what he'll do when the chance of a lifetime presents itself.  Among his daughter's tape collection, they accidentally find a videotape of a superstar rapper in the act of a heinous crime.  Calling on his boaws (crew), they decide together that his only course of action is to blackmail the rapper and get some serious paper.  What Sticks doesn't count on is the tenacity of this rapper or the possibility that someone very close to him could sell him out.  Will he get paid and live to spend it?  Will he put the clues together before it's too late?  Will the paper be worth it?<br /><br />Fast-paced, gutsy, gritty, down-to-earth, action-packed, jaw dropping, page-turner are all terms that I can use to describe WIFEBEATER.  Using South Philly as a backdrop for this urban thriller, Frisby has shaped an impressive tale that captured me in the first paragraph and held me captive until the last word.  The plots were not only mesmerizing, but also deep, as you were propelled through the maze of Sticks' feelings and ghetto instincts with each new twist he was confronted with.  The author did a great job with character development, as each was unforgettable.  The culture of South Philly was embedded in every page with his use of the colorful and distinctive vernacular of those who live in the inner city streets.  I even managed to pick up a couple of terms to impress my more hip-hop friends.

He smells a revolution brewing, and he is at its forefront - accidentally on purpose.<br /><br />Mansbach's story enraptured me with its humor, lilt, and permutation of racial biases, issues, and scope.  By creating a character who was totally different from, and almost antithetic to, any other I had ever read about, Mansbach won me over and held me captive in a story I had yet to hear. The writing was unpredictable and almost improvisational, and it fit the plot of this story without overshadowing the central themes and characters.

We're all the same...	Children should be taught about who they are, both inside and out, getting to know others before they prejudge them, and that it's what is inside of each of us that makes us special.  Additionally, they should understand that what we are inside is important regardless of our race, the color/texture of our hair, where we live, or how rich or poor we are.  Newberry Honor Book Author Julius Lester explores these areas in his latest book for children LET'S TALK ABOUT RACE.<br /><br />I enjoyed LET'S TALK ABOUT RACE and think it is a wonderful tool for helping children understand the differences in those around them and that no one is better than anyone else simply because they are different in some way. I encourage parents and educators to share this book with their children at the early stages when they begin questioning their bodies and comparing them to others.

Power Struggle	ABUSE OF POWER is a tale of political suspense and intrigue with a strong female protagonist. Councilwoman Taylor Mitchell has worked long and hard to earn her position as Speaker of the Council; now she is running for mayor.  When a factory in her district explodes and much of the neighboring housing is destroyed by fire, it becomes apparent that the political aftermath will be severe.  The factory had been controversial since day one; another example of placing an environmentally risky building in a low-income area.  In addition, as a result of a shrinking city budget, the nearest firehouse had been closed in an effort to save money.  The result of course, was a recipe for disaster, and when the factory explodes the fire spreads unchecked because it takes the fire department longer to respond. Councilwoman Mitchell along with the fire chief fought against the closing of the firehouse and the building of the factory, but were unsuccessful.  In spite of her previous political battles, Councilwoman Mitchell can in no way be prepared for the drama that ensues as a major conspiracy begins to unfold before her eyes.  No one is spared; members of her staff, personal friends, even her fianc&eacute; are somehow involved in the grand scheme that has developed behind closed doors.  She must question her friends, make unexpected allies, risk her life, and use all of her political wits to keep power in the right hands.<br /><br />This novel has an intricate plot and a lot of characters.  The fact that I was able to keep up with the story as it unfolded is a testament to Millicent Hodge's fine writing ability.

The Playa got played	Grace Trufant thought she had everything in control: wonderful job, handsome husband that made her the envy of many a woman, and a body that was the desire of many men.  Continuously taking her husband for granted, Grace gets caught up in a whirlwind affair with Brian, whom she leads to believe that she and her husband are separating.  She doesn't expect Brian to fall in love and act like a complete lover gone mad.<br /><br />Edwin, Grace's husband, has a life most men would kill for.  A dynamite wife, stellar career and his best friend Sonia, who worships the ground he walks on.  Although he is aware that she has feelings for him, he knows she will never cross the line, and is grateful for her being there for the long haul.<br /><br />Sonia knows that something is not right with Grace; she is absolutely sure of it.  While out on a date with her current beau, she spots Grace having an intimate lunch with someone other than her husband.  Always looking out for Edwin's best interests and a little of her own, Sonia decides to investigate and gleefully finds out far more than she bargained for.<br /><br />Things heat up when Sonia, Edwin, Grace and Brian all run into each other at a party.  Grace doesn't know how to keep it together, Brian spills the beans, and Sonia is waiting with open arms for Edwin.  They say that greed will break you, and Grace finds out the hard way.<br /><br />FEMALE TRAITS had a good storyline, but was filled with typographical and grammatical errors.  Fortunately, this did not detract too much from the story.  A sincere and realistic view of what occurs everyday, the moral goes without saying - when you play with fire, you're bound to get burned.<br /><br />Reviewed by Belinda<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewers	2005-04-09
Life Happens	I have heard for years what a great writer J. California Cooper is and how people love just about anything she produces. Despite hearing all of the accolades and praises for this author, life happened and I never got around to reading one of her works. I could slap myself for all of the years I missed out on the tales from this adroit storyteller. Her dialogue brings Hurston to mind, and her characters in THE MATTER IS LIFE are just as strong as any of the greats. In fact, I am adding Cooper to my list of greats after reading this collection of beautifully human stories about how people can get in their own ways and how life is life.<br /><br />My favorite story in this collection happened to be the longest. Could it be that I was able to savor even more of Cooper's wisdom in \\"The Doras?\\" It's possible, but more than that, this was a story that had me hanging on to every word about a woman with a dream for her daughters. The narrators in all the stories seem to be sages of sorts; the narrator isn't always a central character in the piece, but she seems to know all the goings on of the people of whom she speaks. This was refreshing and different, and I felt as though she and I were having an all-out gossip session. Don't get me wrong; the stories in this compilation are deep and to the point. There is a lesson to be learned within each tale's contributory pages.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this reading journey. My only complaint is that it was over too soon. Luckily for me, there are numerous other Cooper releases for me to enjoy.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Finding Love	Dana Ellison is engaged to a man she can't stand and works on a job she loathes.  So how did she end up in such a miserable state?  Her overbearing parents.  Her father has molded her in his own image.  He retired a well- respected educator in the school system in which Dana now teaches.  Her mother has single handedly picked her fiance and begins to plan Dana's wedding.  Dana has always gone along with her parents' wishes without much of a fight.  Until she meets landscaper Chris Johnson who shows interest in her, her dreams and what she wants out of life, he beleives in Dana when noone else does.  Her family does not approve and a strain is placed on their relationship.<br /><br />Cheris F. Hodges jumps right into the action of the story.  Ms. Hodges provoked my emotions as I found myself wanting to defend Dana's right to be her own woman.  Dana's conflict of being torn between the love of a man and her family played out nicely and kept my interest.  The romantic scenes were hot, steamy and exciting.  A LOVE OF HER OWN is a well chosen title, it describes the main characters struggle perfectly.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Money and Fame Changes Things	Imagine being near the pinnacle of your career.  People recognize you in the grocery store.  There are all kinds of hype about your potential in all the major newspapers.  The money is rolling in.  People throw themselves at your feet.  The love of your life is there no matter what the circumstance.  You feel unbeatable.  Then, that one thing happens that threatens to bring it all to a screeching halt.<br /><br />Carter Turner, a professional track athlete, is within reach of being labeled the fastest man in the world.  His hopes, dreams and aspirations lie in winning a gold medal at the Olympics and breaking a world record.  His training has gotten him to the point of near superstar status as the endorsements roll in.  With all the support personally and professionally, nothing prepared him for living with money and fame.  With women constantly offering their wares, Carter is continuously juggling lies to tell Nina, his girlfriend of several years.  Then, an anonymous message left on voice mail has him searching his less than stellar past.  It could damage his career in more ways than one and cause him to lose the one woman that has stuck by him through it all.<br /><br />In her first solo project, Courtney Parker is off and running with RUNNIN' GAME.  Using the field of professional track and field as the backdrop in this splendid tale for a unique twist, Parker launches an interesting dialogue on dealing with celebrity status, playing the game and infidelity in relationships.  Being a star and dating a star is not all it's cracked up to be.  When the foundation of trust has been breached in any relationship, both parties lose.  Although the plot had similar undertones of those seen in other books about athletes with star power, Parker was able to use the added twist of track and field to aide in fleshing out a story that made me feel as though I were reading a unique story.  Ms. Parker is now on my radar for her future books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersda M. Lisbon <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-04-09
Double Life, Double Trouble	Kevin Ames has written a fictional account of the down low existence of a young, African-American man.  DOWN LOW SECRETS delves into what has become a sensationalized topic: black men who claim to be heterosexual but engage in sexual activities with other men.  If you want to know more about this taboo subject and you are not squeamish about explicit sex scenes, this story will give you some education in a very dramatic way.<br /><br />Trent Matthews is a young, professional, African-American man who is engaged to Lisa Cooper, a young attorney.  Trent feels that Lisa is a perfect complement to him and knows marriage and children will be a welcome change in his life.  Yet, Trent lives a secret life Lisa knows nothing about.  As much as he wants to marry Lisa, his desire for a hard body and quick, easy sex can't seem to be controlled.  From one sexual escapade to another, Trent engages in risky and potentially life-destroying antics.<br /><br />Lisa, on the other hand, has been in some devastating relationships that have left her untrusting.  So when she becomes suspicious of Trent's behavior, she does a little sleuthing and will stop at nothing to find out the truth.  When she discovers Trent's secret life, what lengths will she go through to avenge the wrongs done to her?<br /><br />DOWN LOW SECRETS is an over-the-top and sensationalized version of \\"DL\\" behavior.  Author Kevin Ames gives readers a first hand account of the thought processes of a man who is living a double life, as well as giving them a little lesson on the down low lingo.  Readers will find this a quick read, but will be frustrated in the flatness of the characters, the stereotypical behaviors and predictable plot.  I was hoping to read about a man's struggle with a behavior that is not accepted by society and who genuinely cared about his fianc&eacute;e.  However, what I read was a man who abhorred sex with women and had sex with men every chance he could get with blatant disregard for the consequences.  I wanted a more human account peppered with emotion and truth.  Unfortunately, this didn't happen and I am still left asking why because no real secrets were ever revealed.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersquences.

Love Conquers All	Michele is a smart, sexy, sophisticated and career driven woman.  Her life quickly turns into a daytime drama similar to her favorite If Tomorrow Never Comes, when accusations of unethical conduct surface in her reporting tactics for the Manhattan Business Journal.  Michele transfers to a local paper in her hometown where the soap opera continues and the plot thickens.<br /><br />Wesley Abbott is a ladies man in the purest sense of the term.  He is smooth, suave and good looking.  No woman has been able to hold and keep his attention for long.  That is until a reporter from an associate paper walks into the newsroom where he works as investigative reporter.  Wesley is taken aback by the confidence and sophistication that Michele exudes.  A man accustomed to having his way, he pursues her until she relents.<br /><br />There is corruption brewing in the court system and Wesley, being the investigative reporter that he is, sets out to expose the wrongdoings of court officials.  Michele, missing the excitement of big story reporting, enlists herself in Wesley's cause and along the way uncovers a jaw-dropping conflict that could tear them apart.<br /><br />IF YOU JUST SAY YES is a nicely written romance with a twist of mystery.  Laudat gave Michele and Wesley the perfect balance of tension and sexual energy.  The subplots gave the characters definition and tied together well to round out the storyline.  I love a romance with a little something extra on the side.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Friend or Foe	NOTHING LIKE FRIENDS tells the story of four friends who struggle with life and love.  Alexis, Simone, Sidney and Tracey have been friends for over thirty years.  They are a second generation of friendship born out of the bond their mothers have shared over the years.

Simone, who has never had a man who was unattached, is pregnant.  Can you guess who the baby's daddy is?  Sidney, Simone's twin sister is ready to throw her marriage and husband to the wind when her husband's past indiscretion comes back to haunt them.  Tracey can't seem to let go of her marriage which ended with the death of her husband ten years ago.  The women fall apart, tell each other off, and they even have a fist fight, but will they pull together and make it through?<br /><br />Shannon N. Davis is new to writing, but writes like she has done this a few times. She writes about the bonds of friendships, not only of women but as men as well.  Capturing the complexities of relationships through her characters.  The storyline flows well and the dialog is frank and honest, like only a girlfriend can give.  With the supporting male characters, Davis is able to give a different views on male/female relationships.  I liked the reality she created the characters in, for every action they made there was reaction or a consequence they had to deal with.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-04-09
Dear Daddy...	As we get older and mature, sometimes we come to a crossroad in our lives.  This is when we start to examine all aspects of our existence.  Some may call it a midlife crisis but for others it is the search for the missing puzzle piece of life.  James Phalen is at that point in his life and the one thing that nags him is the fact he never played catch with his father.  I NEVER PLAYED CATCH WITH MY FATHER is a loving tribute to a father who was not always able to convey his feelings with embraces and words, but who loved his children.<br /><br />James Phalen is one of the richest white men in the United States.  He is a savvy businessman who came from poverty and has had major monetary success.  However, when his father becomes ill, he decides that all the money and material things in the world will not settle the restlessness within him until he can spend time with his father.  He journeys home in hopes of understanding his father but what he discovers is more about himself.<br /><br />James' father is a religious man with strong convictions who desired only the best for his three children and that meant working very hard on their farm to provide them with the necessities.  However, he was a man of few words and even fewer physical demonstrations of affection, he was always serious and James doesn't remember a playful time with his father. Now it is too late to understand and rectify the situation, or is it?  What James discovers while home with his ailing father is that love can be shown in many ways and we have to learn to accept it anyway it is given.  He also realizes childhood perceptions can be reinterpreted when we become mature adults.<br /><br />Gene Cartwright has written a very touching story of how important love is for children.  I NEVER PLAYED CATCH WITH MY FATHER was not just about a moment of play, it was the epitome of what children want more than anything from their fathers; love.  The story is a pleasant ride through James' life and it comes to a beautiful and emotional end.  Although the author is African-American, his main character is white, which I found very unique and intriguing.  Honestly, it would not have mattered what race the characters were, because the story crosses all color barriers.  Even though the pace was a little slow in the beginning, the character development, the imagery and the plot will keep readers interested.  The novel will appeal to everyone no matter what race or sex because it is truly a timeless story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ  Reviewerscomes to a beautiful and emotional end.

Payback at its best...	Ever wanted to repay a person for something they did to you?  Ever actually disregarded legal ramifications and gone through with it, showing payback at its best?  Well, THE ART OF RETRIBUTION is the continuance of the thriller series by Millicent Y. Hodge which follows her other titles, Abuse of Power, Absence of Justice, and Act of Vengeance.<br /><br />Roger Alexander, former Deputy Attorney General has been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  To the dismay of the guards and FBI agents handling the transport, he is shot while in their custody, and later rushed off in an ambulance, assumed as dead.  Shortly afterwards, it is discovered that his body never makes it to the hospital.  Alexander disappears and no one knows where to aim the investigation.<br /><br />Sidney Cox, the U. S. Attorney who ran into a few problems herself in one of the earlier books, prosecuted the case, but is kidnapped shortly after Alexander's disappearance.  She's not alone though, because a jump-then-look prosecutor and a reformed, bad guy are also taken against their will.  Deputy Director Charles Thomas is left to pick up the pieces.<br /><br />Millicent Y. Hodge continues with the same slow-building suspense of whodunit found in her previous works.  While the reader doesn't have to read the other books in the series, it makes it so much more enjoyable when you have the history of the characters before you begin reading THE ART OF RETRIBUTION.  The book is shocking and suspenseful, but also entertaining and enlightening.  Amidst honed characters and an interesting storyline, the protagonists learn that their past mistakes don't necessarily dictate or determine their future. Through the trials and life and death situations, they each learn a bit more about themselves and what it will take to persevere.  With quite a few twists thrown in to keep the reader guessing, Hodge masterfully creates a cast of characters who beg to be brought back again and again.

Potential Versus Temptation	This novel's main character, Marcus, epitomizes the balancing act of wanting a successful life and also needing to remain close to your past.  If that past consisted of friends who indulged in drugs, hustling, and violence, you would  have to be a talented juggler.  GOD HELPS THOSE is a tale of such choices and decisions.<br /><br />Marcus' resume includes a law degree, an MBA and a degree in engineering, and he is not even thirty years old.  The book opens with him stressing to get a surprise birthday party he has worked hard to plan for his mother.  Thus, his personal resume also includes being caring and sensitive under the section \\"emotions\\". Marcus' ego should have been impenetrable, but if only that were the case. Even though he is a suited-down man with street smarts, starts a new job as an attorney, has women staring, and just moved into his own apartment, Marcus is constantly second guessing himself. Does Marcus subscribe to the adage: \\"if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything\\"?  Some of his routine choices become monumental because of the consequences waiting to either destroy or uplift.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and do recommend it because of the tight storyline, fully developed characters, realistic, and very relevant issues.  Cramer did an excellent job of  conveying emotions, physical reactions, symptoms and the inner reflections of the characters.  I look forward to the sequel GOD BLESS THE CHILD, advertised at the end, although I urge Cramer to be more critical of the editing because the misuse of words, such as defiantly being used for definitely,in several sentences and other grammatical errors were unnecessary distractions and could have been avoided by using  a little more energy and focus before the final printing.<br /><br />Reviewed by Janet \\"Jaize\\" Brown<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-03-25
All is fair in love and war	Jason Thomas has the best of both worlds - a very successful business and a wonderful wife, or does it just seem that way?  Jason is a debonair gentleman on the inside and a street-smart thug on the outside who would do anything for his wife, Taylor.  Yet, their marriage is not without its problems.  Taylor is a self-centered, materialistic woman who takes her man's dedication and his rising empire for granted.  Feeling a bit forlorn, Taylor gets the idea that the grass is greener on the other side of the tracks.  Enter into the scene, David, Jason's business partner.  David is a hater with a capital \\"H\\".  With a friend like David, who needs enemies?  What David, Taylor and anyone else who comes up against Jason doesn't know, is that he is a very strong force to be contended with.  Does one wrong turn deserve another?  Will Taylor wise up before she loses everything that she holds near and dear?  Will Jason realize what's going on before it's too late?<br /><br />In TWISTED, the drama is never ending and as I was reading this, I kept saying \\"hmmm, what's next?\\".  The reader is picked up and placed smack dab in the middle of the action from the very beginning.  The characters are living the life in the fast-lane - drugs, money, sex and scandal run rampant through the pages of TWISTED.  The book has unexpected plot twists that will leave you shaking your head.  All in all, this is a good debut novel by Mr. White.  I would have liked to have seen a little more depth in regards to character development and some stronger editing, however, TWISTED will take you on a drama-filled ride that you won't forget.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-03-25
Deliverance	Often, in our darkest hour, a light the size of a pin head is enough to brighten our path. For Rolanda T. Pyle the light was the poetry that poured from her soul.  FINALLY is a compilation of poems and articles that helped to unlock her spirit, and `finally' set her free.  Though the book has no particular theme, it is filled with inspirational messages which encapsulate who the author is. She shares her struggles when she dealt with unstable relationships, losing weight, and with her deteriorating health. She has included scriptures and sayings that correspond with the poetry or which<br />simply have special meaning to her.<br /><br />Rolanda says that she has only shared little pieces and she promises of more to come, but these pieces are the ones which kept her sane when her faith was wavering. She hopes readers will take this journey with her; read about how God has truly showered his blessing upon her.<br /><br />The poems are warm and embraceable and a few take you to that vicarious place where everything feels right.<br /><br />\\"It's been a long time coming but thank God, finally it's here.\\"<br />--Rolanda T.

Mixing Business and Pleasure	What happens when you take six very diverse co-workers and place them in a remote and picturesque beach house in order for them to come up with a successful marketing plan?  You will get some drama.  THE BEACH HOUSE is a novel that captures the complexities of co-workers who do not really know each other outside of the office, but work through their differences in hopes of accomplishing a common goal.<br /><br />Felicia Sampson and Kym Kersey are the leaders of this marketing meeting and they plan to work and play.  With four other associates, they work to complete the advertising plan during the span of a weekend.  However, in between work and as the liquor begins to flow, a bit of drama ensues when betrayal, lust and lies surface.  It all comes to a climatic end when closely held secrets are revealed.<br /><br />THE BEACH HOUSE has some humorous moments as the antics of the characters emerge.  The beginning of the novel was a bit slow because there was not enough dialogue and too much narrative, but as the story progresses this minor problem was corrected.  I personally enjoyed the diversity of the six African-Americans, but I would have liked to have seen more interaction regarding their differences and a bit more of their background.  The ending seemed a bit abrupt because it left a few unanswered questions.  This is a good story with great promise, but I felt it could have been expanded by delving more into the character development.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05

Just to wake up each morning and see their angelic faces will put a smile on the face of even the hardest person.<br /><br />Sharonetta \\"Shay\\" Taylor and her husband Marvin are ecstatic when their son Marvin, Jr. was born.  In their eyesight, their lives were perfect.  Not only did they have a happy, healthy child, they were also active in their church and outside ministries.  Suddenly, their bright days turn dark when six-year old Marvin, Jr. is killed in an auto accident.  How will Marvin and Shay cope with this loss?  Will they seek comfort in God and in each other, or will their pain be so great they withdraw into themselves?  To find the answers to these questions and more, I encourage you to pick up a copy of this very compelling novel.<br /><br />ABIDING HOPE was a very deep, emotional read.  I could not imagine having to bury my only child, or any child for that matter.  Ms. Benson did an excellent job of showing the character's sorrow and how it affected their lives.  The emotions portrayed did not seem over the top.  Instead, they were so real, it was if you were experiencing the loss yourself.  There were many times I found myself wanting to reach in and offer a consoling hug and words of encouragement.

I Can Get Over It	If you have ever been on the receiving end of being dumped by a husband, wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend then you certainly can attest to the range of emotions expressed in HURRY UP AND GET OVER YOUR X by Felicia Foy.  Foy has written a 31 day guide to help women and men alike, get over their ex.<br /><br />Each chapter reveals a possible emotion that we may experience and she offers suggestions on how to cope those feelings by simply doing.  Foy also assigns ownership to the emotions by emphasizing the fact that although we are human and there is nothing wrong with us for feeling as we do, we must move on.  She states, \\"let go and let God,\\" \\"take inventory,\\" \\"work on you,\\" \\"give your children extra TLC,\\" \\"develop a healthy self-esteem,\\" \\"your \\"X\\" is dead,\\" \\"learn to relax,\\" \\"don't let your new man friend become your savior,\\" and the list goes on.<br /><br />The chapters present titles that grab your attention and beg you to read on. Since it is not presented in an analytical style, but in a straight up, no chaser fashion, the most novice reader of self-help books can comprehend these suggestions.  At the end of each day, she offers words of advice, a thought for the day or a worthy song to assist in capturing the foundation that she has laid.

A reality check	Bringing a child into the world is a decision that should be made after much thought and conversation with one's spouse.  Even the most level-headed adult can be overwhelmed with the responsibilities associated with the well-being of a baby, no matter how old they are.  But, imagine being a teenager, suddenly thrown into the role of expectant father and then fatherhood.  It is not something discussed often enough in our society, yet author Angela Johnson has focused on this subject in the book THE FIRST PART LAST, narrated by sixteen-year-old Bobby Morris.<br /><br />Bobby Morris is like most other teenage guys in his neighborhood.  He likes to play basketball, hang out with his friends, and skip school on occasion.  All of this changes when his girlfriend becomes pregnant.  Determined to do the right thing and support her decision to have the baby and then give it up for adoption, he's there to comfort her and assure her all will be well.  His childhood is immediately taken from him as things don't work out quite as planned and he finds himself with his daughter Feather relying solely on him.  Feather is his first priority and though he lives with his mother, she's stepped back in order for him to step up to be the man necessary to raise his child.  From the amazement of having his own child, to the look of adoration on her face, Bobby must make the journey of fatherhood and deal with growing up faster than planned.<br /><br />THE FIRST PART LAST is a reality check for many teenagers who are participating in sexual activities and should be required reading in schools across the country.  Johnson uses chapters entitled \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\" to back-track from the past (before the baby is born) to the present (after the baby is born) of Bobby's young life.  It is a touching story of a boy struggling with his feelings of fatherhood and all things necessary to ensure his daughter's well-being.  While I did enjoy the story, I often felt as if I was in a game of Red Light, Green Light in which you stop and go depending on the leader's directions.  I didn't like the format of switching from past and present in alternating chapters as it took some of the intensity away from the story.  However, the book did paint a very realistic view of teenage pregnancy and the joys, fears, and thoughts of parenthood.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A Mother-Daughter Thing	Trisha Gadson emerges onto the literary scene with her heartfelt freshman novel THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS.  Based mainly in the Washington, D.C., area, this is a novel about a daughter's testament to her mother's strong will and courageous strength as she endures the most trying time of her life.  The dire situation forces a role reversal where daughter becomes the mother.<br /><br />Lorraine Jackson is a rolling stone by all accounts.  She was widowed at an early age and faced raising a young daughter by herself.  Lorraine tried hard to give her daughter Sherina nothing but the very best.  Sherina was a quasi-clone of her mother with her exuberant personality and a take-no-prisoners approach to everything.  With similar type personalities the mother and daughter duo often butt heads, yet their strong bond is undeniable.  Lorraine meddles a bit too much in Sherina's marriage to Niles and dotes on her young granddaughter.  When Lorraine is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, Sherina's life is thrust into a tailspin.  Thank God Niles is a strong supporting husband in his own quiet way.  Oftentimes, Sherina must travel from their home in Pennsylvania to be by her mother's side.  As time passes, Lorraine's life precariously balances on the point of no return.  Will Sherina be able to realize that the battle is not hers and turn her mother's fate over to the Lord?<br /><br />THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS is a book that tugs on the heartstrings of its readers as it portrays familial love and obligation.  I found myself rallying for Sherina's continued strength in the Lord as she dealt with the reality that was facing her.  This book was a touching read.  It delved into a very serious situation and provided a look into the lives of he characters, who were believable and seemed familiar.  This book was a reminder of how fragile life can be and that we do not know what God has in store for us.  If you're looking for a straight from the heart novel, then I'd recommend you pick up a copy of THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS.

What Happens When You're Not Looking for Love	In PASSION'S PROMISE by Christine Townsend, Clara St. John is not looking for love.  So when she meets the man behind the company that may destroy the community in which she works, love is far from her mind.  Inspite of the fact that she finds him handsome, her first inclination is to give him a good beat down.  Jet Stevens, a former pro-football player who is now a real estate magnate, is used to having things his way.  However, it's a horse of a different color when he meets the woman who is blocking his recent real estate deal and his potential to earn millions.<br /><br />As the two adversaries realize that fighting is not going to accomplish anything, they decide to work together to broker a deal that will help the community.  While they hammer out the details, their attraction to each other continues to build.  With the community taken care of, they then negotiate another deal that will personally benefit the two of them.  This deal, however, comes with circumstances neither could possibly have guessed would threaten their future happiness and possibly cause Jet to lose his company.<br /><br />Christine Townsend has written an astonishing love story centered around a big business deal designed to bring luxury condominiums and millions of dollars to a bayfront area in Tampa, which at the same time will displace many people in a public housing project. Who would have thought that you could find love in community activism when all parties are against one another?  The characters were fresh and genuine; I enjoyed getting to know each and every one of them.  I applaud Ms. Townsend for her ability to evoke so many emotions in me as I read this novel, while at the same time teaching me about caring for my community. She shows that sometimes the motives behind business ventures in inner city communities aren't always in the best interest of the inhabitants, and that love can be found anywhere there are two willing candidates.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

God's Will Be Done	AS THE SHOFAR BLEW takes a look into the life of a small church who is under new leadership. It focuses on the life of a Pastor both personally and professionally.  As a Christian, all decisions and the way you live your life are to be made by the leading of God's voice. You will be enlightened by how easy it is for a Pastor to lose sight of God's will when his eyes and heart are far from God. What I enjoyed most about this book was the realism in which it was written. It was easy to understand without being preachy. The characters are very well developed and I could see people I knew in several of them. Some people put Pastors on a pedestal as though they can do no wrong. But they are human and fleshly creatures just as we are. Take a look inside this book and see what happens when a Pastor is lead by his flesh and not by his spirit.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

No greater love...	Amara Fairchild is shocked when her dying mentor and best friend Brenda Hayward asks her to marry her husband, and to help raise her children immediately after her death.  Of course, neither Ross, Brenda's husband, nor Amara immediately agree to this. However, when they see that Brenda is holding on to that one last breath waiting for their positive response, they reluctantly agree.  From there, the story unfolds into a tale of love lost and love found on the oftentimes bumpy road to happily ever after.<br /><br />It has been a while since I read a novel by Ms. Louise, and once I read A LOVE OF THEIR OWN, I couldn't fathom why I waited so long to read this one.  It was a beautiful tale of heartache, loss and finding love again.  There are so many positive aspects to this story that combine to make this book one worth reading many times over.  Louise masterfully depicts the woes of breast cancer, the importance of monthly breast exams, and how the death of a loved one from this dreaded disease affects everyone, especially small children.  It was refreshing to see the hero of the story show real emotion.  Ross cherished his wife and did not want to sully the memories of her with thoughts or feelings for another woman.  Even though the story deals with such serious issues, there are also moments where you laugh out loud, and, of course, fall in love again.  Never again will I hold onto a Kim Louise book.  As soon as it reaches my hot little hands, I will find the quietest spot in my house and lose myself in her work.

Popularity at a Price	Sharon Draper's THE BATTLE OF JERICHO is an interesting story that examines the cost that sometimes comes with popularity.  In the book, Jericho and a few of his friends have been invited to join the illustrious group, The Warriors of Distinction.  The group, modeled after a fraternity, has been around for decades and is known not only for the far reaching community projects they sponsor but for their clout as well.  Jericho, his cousin and several of his friends are invited to join the group but first they must make it through the initiation process.  As the initiation process continues, Jericho feels more and more uncomfortable with some of the things the pledges are required to do and must decide when enough is enough.  There are more than a few surprises in the story that help keep things interesting.  In addition, there are several subplots in the story that address issues such as surviving a physical handicap, teen dating, and dealing with neglectful parents.  As the story develops, the drama continues to heighten until the story reaches its dramatic climax.<br /><br />The book's biggest strength is in its realism; I felt the characters could have easily been real teens.  I also liked the fact that for the most part, the author let the characters and plot show messages rather than incorporating a lot of preachiness.  On the other hand, it seemed as if Draper tried to incorporate too many social issues into the various subplots, many of which were rather underdeveloped.  The issues the secondary characters faced were quite serious; yet, the author spent just enough time talking about them to make you want to know more.  While Jericho's story had sufficient closure, there were simply too many loose ends left untied.  THE BATTLE OF JERICHO is a well-paced story with lots of twists and turns, and as a result it is hard to put down.  The book will not only make readers think, but it will also remind them of how quickly things can spiral out of control.

In The Shadows	Jade Winters is a career-driven woman who has not healed from her tumultuous past.  She is owner and director of a successful dance studio in Chicago.  She immerses herself in her work to avoid men, and the very device she uses, draws her to the one man, Noel Merson, who will bring her from behind the protective wall she has built.  Noel also has emotional issues to overcome.  He has had his fair share of superficial and meaningless relationships.  After giving his heart away in the past only to be hurt, he is not eager to fall in love again.<br /><br />There are individuals in Jade and Noel's lives that do not wish them well.  They would like nothing more than for the two to part ways.  A series of unsettling events by an unknown perpetrator cause friction between the two.  As they try to work things out, an outside influence is working to keep them apart.<br /><br />SHADES AND SHADOWS is a nicely written romance, but I expected more suspense.  I was caught up in the romance between Jade and Noel and felt warm and fuzzy during their romantic moments, but I also felt disappointed because there was not enough tension as to the plans of the perpetrator.  As a result,I did not feel the pleasurable excitement and anticipation regarding the mysterious outcome.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05

Deadly oblivion	L.A. Banks has taken THE BITTEN, the fourth book in the Vampire<br /><br />Huntress series, to another level. A vampire civil war was averted,<br /><br />but a master vampire stole one of the keys - the living blood of<br /><br />Christ which opened one of the gates of Hell, causing a fluctuation<br /><br />in the balance between Light and Dark, affecting Damali Richards,<br /><br />the vampire huntress. The added horror is that the stolen key can be<br /><br />used to open the sixth seal as foretold in the book of Revelations.<br /><br />This would unlock all of the gates of Hell; the sun would turn to<br /><br />ashes, and the universe would be in perpetual darkness. The need for<br /><br />a day walker from the union between the vampire huntress and a master<br /><br />vampire would no longer exist. The owner of the key and the seal<br /><br />could decide the outcome of the Final War, `the Armageddon'.<br /><br />Damali and Carlos Rivera, the Council-level master vampire, are ready<br /><br />to pursue the contradiction of kinetic emotions that flows between<br /><br />them. Since reaching her twenty-first birthday, Damali is immune<br /><br />to attacks of vampirism, but that was before the key was stolen.<br /><br />Carlos is shocked when in the throes of passion, Damali unleashes<br /><br />the fangs of a master vampire and feeds from him. A tormented Carlos<br /><br />knows something major has gone wrong. His Damali, the vampire<br /><br />huntress, is turning. Damali and Carlos' lives become an oxymoron;<br /><br />she travels the world of darkness as a vampire, and Carlos crosses<br /><br />prayer lines to plead for her safety. Their love creates a situation<br /><br />which could prove to be as ill-timed and as deadly as the stolen key.<br /><br />Desperate to find the key, Carlos masterminds a plan to prevent<br /><br />further disaster. He elicits the help of Damali's team, and begins<br /><br />his mission, but at what cost?  A confrontation in Hell with the<br /><br />vampire Council, Damali's death, or his own destruction? Theory and<br /><br />real world circumstance always produce different results.<br /><br />L.A. Banks has crested another realm to her writing, as she unleashes<br /><br />a battle, between the topside master vampires, so intense it alters<br /><br />the stasis between good versus evil. With the skill of a veteran, Ms.<br /><br />Banks takes this horrific storyline and evolves it into a classic love<br /><br />story without losing the power or the intrigue of the world of darkness.<br /><br />In awe at the depth of this story, and the intensity with which Ms.<br /><br />Banks approaches this series, I anxiously await book five. THE BITTEN<br /><br />is not for the faint of spirit; it will cater to those who love to<br /><br />embrace the forbidden. At one point I was tempted to lower my collar<br /><br />and offer my neck.

A Lamb to Slaughter	Abuse, neglect, resentment, and torture are all things that the title character in Olympia Vernon's LOGIC endures. While Logic is growing up, it seems that those around her are regressing. Logic's mother, Too, resents her for the attention Logic's father gives to his daughter. If Too could only see that that type of attention is the type that no one wants, perhaps she would be better equipped to care about her daughter the way a mother should. Logic is forced to go it alone, clinging to the faithful prayers to get her through as she kneels and hums her praises and pleas. While she dreams of angels and butterflies, her reality runs over with the blood of a sacrificial lamb, which happens to be herself.<br /><br />Logic's story is heartbreaking, tragic, outrageous, and haunting. In many instances, I was caught off guard by some of the prose and it became difficult to concentrate on the storyline. However, it's my suspicion that Vernon wanted the characters to drive this book, rather than the plot or storyline. Logic and the people she knew left a mark on me; they were all so different, but in many ways, so much alike, but too blinded by their afflictions to recognize it. It seems to me that this is often the case in the real world. We have the most conflict with those who are reflections of ourselves. While the sequence of events these characters experienced was notable, it was their individual essences that left their marks on me.<br /><br />In the end, I was able to piece it all together and was presented with a memorable reading experience. Vernon's works are not effortlessly consumed; it takes thought to comprehend the latent meanings behind her strings of words, her alphabet, as she calls it. There are still some things I would like to ask her about - things that escaped me. Nonetheless, this was not a novel that was just a story, it was one that was a lesson in literature.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
Too many questions	What happens to a boy who is raised by his grandmother and only knows his father through tales from the neighborhood, his mother and his grandmother? Does he idolize a man he doesn't know? Or does he turn his back on the man who abandoned him?<br /><br />Nasir, also known as Marv Bundy III, attempts to deal with his life as a young black man whose only role models are those men and boys in the street who are suffering the same losses that he has. He has no role model to discuss his many issues with. When he produces a child out of wedlock with a girl who is, in his eyes, a one-night-stand, should he take care of his child? What does he do when his baby momma demands his full attention? Does he abandon the woman he wants to make his wife in order to provide for his child and satisfy his baby momma? What happens when his mother sides with his baby momma? Does he cut his mother off from his affection? We get to watch Nasir grow up and make his own decisions: some good, some bad.<br /><br />KaShamba Williams has woven a novel of love, hate, desperation, fear and abandonment. One of the pluses is that she actually tells the reader what the street slang means when she uses it. This is certainly a help to those who are not familiar with urban language. While the novel catches your attention from the somewhat confusing beginning, more editing would make it an easier and more enjoyable read.

She grabbed it, worked it and didn't let go until the end.  I was completely enthralled in this psychological suspense thriller.  The tales that the main character, Kurt, wrote were just as entertaining and gripping as the main story.  The only negative comment about this book was that at times the transition between Kurt's writings and the story itself was not very clear and concise.  Be that as it may, this was a very interesting creation by Ms. Clarke. (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05

However, I would suggest reading Departures first, because the background on the characters is very brief and limited.  I also found the pace of the story to be quite slow due to excessive narratives and stiff dialogue. Although it was nice catching up with the characters, this sequel falls short of my expectations.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
Political Gumbo	The 2000 Presidential election was a devastating experience for the Democratic Party and for the country. Voting irregularities and dirty politics blazed the trail to the White House for George W. Bush. As the Democrats struggled to recover from an election that was ultimately decided by the United States Supreme Court, Donna Brazile, the manager of the Gore-Lieberman campaign, pondered her political future. She had made history as the first black person to head a major presidential campaign, now it was time to pick up the pieces and decide what was next in her life. Ultimately she would turn to her humble beginnings for support and guidance.<br /><br />Donna Lease Brazile was born December 15, 1959, in New Orleans, Louisiana, one of nine children in a poor working class family that was low on money but rich in pride and intelligence. She started her illustrious political career at the age of nine and never looked back. Donna went from registering people to vote in her neighborhood to planning marches to have Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday declared a national holiday. However, her key role has been twofold: to get out the black vote during elections and to make sure that the black vote is not taken for granted by the Democratic party. She takes the political process very seriously and wants to bring the same keen awareness to others.<br /><br />COOKING WITH GREASE: Stirring the Pots in American Politics by Donna Brazile is the true story of an enterprising and determined woman whose passion for politics and for her people propelled her to lead a major campaign. She is a great storyteller and the fact that each chapter was named after a tasty New Orleans dish made reading this book even more enjoyable. I am very inspired by the author's story and I am much more motivated to become a part of the political process.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

I Need Aretha	If there is anything that remains constant in my life, it is knowing that Aretha Franklin is a sister spirit and that her voice can help to calm me in the most torrential times. It seems that when I listen to Aretha she is speaking directly to me, telling me she knows what I am going through and that everything will turn out fine. Matt Dobkin revisits the recording of a 1967 album that shot Aretha Franklin to the highest level of stardom and changed the voice of soul music forever and changed my life forever.<br /><br />I NEVER LOVED A MAN THE WAY I LOVE YOU is not just a biography. Instead, it is a detailed analysis of Aretha's rise to superstardom and the recording sessions during what some would argue is Aretha's finest hour. Dobkin interviewed many of the direct participants of the recording of I Never Loved a Man The Way I Love You to inject the history needed to make telling this story a success. However, he also included thoughts from the great poet Nikki Giovanni (her descriptions of both Aretha's presence and the tumultuous era in question were remarkable) and other contemporaries of the Queen of Soul for added context.<br /><br />The album, I Never Loved a Man The Way I Love You, included such cuts as \\"Do Right Woman,\\" \\"Save Me,\\" \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" (one of my favorite Aretha songs) and the female anthem, \\"Respect,\\" an Otis Redding song that Aretha covered and made her own. But, as Dobkin seems to relay, one of the most important aspects of this recording was that it was interracial; most of the musicians on the album were young white men from Muscle Shoals, Alabama or neighboring cities. Dobkin also notes that the musical process that was utilized on this album (Aretha at the piano, leading the show) would become her M.O. for making music from that day forward.<br /><br />Aretha has numerous albums to her credit, ranging from a Dinah Washington tribute album, recorded during her stint at Columbia Records, to the Atlantic Records late-sixties masterpiece that is the focus of this book. Dobkin seemed to know what he was talking about when retelling the story of the album's birth, and he provided much needed groundwork to help the reader understand just how important that album was in 1967 and still is today. I Never Loved a Man The Way I Love You ushered in the reign of the Queen of Soul and widely introduced this timeless voice to the favorites list of music lovers worldwide. Dobkin gave Aretha her demanded Respect and took it a step further by praising her musical virtuosity.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthat is the focus of this book.

Bringing the Hood to Life	When  Lil Wayne proclaimed he needed a hoodrat chick in one of his songs a few years ago, he was rapping about Unique, Nina, and Anyeh.  These names represent the titles of the three stories in this anthology.  I commend authors Nikki Turner, Chunichi and Roy Glenn for their candid depiction of life in the ghetto fabulous streets.  These stories are a new soap opera ala urban style. Revenge is the major theme throughout all three tales.<br /><br />The coarse and cool style of the authors is reminiscent of Donald Goines, the king of gangster tales from the hood.  These new authors spin dramatic violent gritty glimpses of how drugs, sex, greed, and crime are as common as week day rush hour for the gainfully employed citizens.<br /><br />Despite the brutal acquaintances and constant struggle to survive Virginia's hoods, the girls find time to love their men. You will need to read each story to discover whether their men are worthy of love; or even if the girls are capable of committing and loving beyond lust and gold digging.<br /><br />I found each tale to be fast-paced, disturbing, and absorbing enough to digest the entire book within a day.<br /><br />The authors blend together in a hip- hop- rhythm- writing style which flows together  like a good concert.  Each  writer's voice  has the same beat, giving the reader a comfort zone between stories, almost as if one writer had penned all three treats.<br /><br />These talented three have marked their territory in the urban genre and I look forward to reading more from them. I must point out that Roy Glenn's Nina, ended by paving the way for a complete novel in which to finish her drama. The tales of Anyeh and Unique are complete, but of course the authors could always do readers a favor and pen more escapades involving these characters or their crew.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jaize<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
The Great I AM	God, Jehovah, Allah... the list goes on and on. So many believers in a higher power, but do they truly believe? Do you believe?<br /><br />In WWW. URIM AND THUMMIM .GOD, archeologist Dr. David Holland sets out on a treacherous journey to find the Jerusalem Urim and Thummim, the crystals that ancient high priests used to speak with God. Knowing his investors would think him crazy, he didn't tell them exactly what he'd be looking for in the wilderness of Judah. Once he finds the \\"Oracles of the Lord,\\" David's faith allows him to speak with God-and modern technology allows God's answers to be recorded.<br /><br />Do you believe? So many believers in a higher power, but do they truly believe? God, Jehovah, Allah... the list goes on and on. What would you ask God? If God answered you and you told one of your \\"believer\\" friends, how would they react to you? If someone told you God spoke to them, how would you react?<br /><br />I'll be honest, when I first opened this book to the last page and saw that it was 723 pages, I was like, \\"No way can a book about an archeologist keep me interested that long. Who does he think he is, Indiana Jones?\\" Then I began reading, and David Swingler drew me into the plight of an archeologist and his students on a dig in Egypt. I found myself excited when the team literally found Goliath's sword. When the authorities came, I wanted to rewrite the book so their findings, film and artifacts wouldn't be taken from them. There was plenty of adventure to keep me interested. WWW. URIM AND THUMMIM .GOD also stimulated me in other ways. I thought about the answers that God gave Dr. Holland and if I agreed with them. Though a very good read, the conversation between Dr. Holland and God dragged too long, leaving Swingler to rush the ending; otherwise, I truly enjoyed WWW. URIM AND THUMMIM .GOD.

An island paradise	Antigua, an awe-inspiring vacation spot for Europeans and North Americans, takes on a different aura when discussed by native Jamaica Kincaid. Ms. Kincaid describes how the Antiguans feel about the tourists who visit: ugly people. Ugly because they invaded, then brought slaves to work for them so they could become rich while ignoring the needs of those who made them wealthy. Ugly because of what they've done to the island and the people who live there. Jamaica talks about the corrupt government and the hand that North Americans, British, Syrians and Lebanese play in that corruption. She describes how England paved the roads the Queen of England would travel when she visited, but left everything else in poor condition. Ms. Kincaid also mentions the drug dealers that the government ignores and those who build ugly condos for the wealthy and rent business space to the government who should be building their own space.<br /><br />In a very few pages, Jamaica Kincaid says what a lot of former slaves would like to say but are perhaps too politically correct to utter. She does the job for us. Ms. Kincaid does not mince her words when it comes to what the British Empire did to the people of Antigua and the world for that matter. Frequently, I found myself wanting to stand up and cheer as I read her words of disgust and anger. While Ms. Kincaid is specifically speaking of Antigua, her words describe the slave trade and the destruction and poverty left in the wake of it no matter what country. It is well worth reading - more than once.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
Mic Check	Heralded as a literary artist since his teenage years, Mark Anthony<br /><br />Thomas has amassed a list of credits to accompany his name. THE<br /><br />POETIC REPERCUSSION, his second book of poetry, returns him to his<br /><br />literary roots. When I attempt to describe this work, terms like<br /><br />lyrical, rhythmic, controversial and triumphant come to mind.<br /><br />Mark uses his poetic voice to narrate through the gamut of social<br /><br />issues which envelops life like an enemy's flank. He leaves no<br /><br />issue unturned as he artfully blends traditional and cross-cultural<br /><br />literary styles with the contemporary styles of prose, spoken word,<br /><br />and music.<br /><br />Were I to choose just one poem from this melting pot of thought<br /><br />provoking poetry that captures the essence of where life takes us,<br /><br />it would be the opening title `Psychiatrist's Chair'. With this poem,<br /><br />he eloquently guides readers through a narrow path of pitfalls that<br /><br />could very well lead to insanity.

Parents Just Don't Understand	EDDIE'S ORDEAL is the fourth in the NEATE series, a collection of books about a group middle school aged friends, who form a club.  In this story, Eddie Delaney has finally found his niche playing basketball on his junior high school team.  He is good enough to play as a starter and loves all the added attention he receives as a result of being a star player.  Surprisingly, it is the extra attention from his dad, not his peers, that means the most to him.  Eddie's father, a successful attorney with high expectations for his son, is a bit detached.  But basketball seems to be a common interest that the father and son share, and as a result, they are spending more time together than ever before.  That is until Eddie brings home his mid-term grades and his parents force him to quit the team and focus on his studies.  In addition to losing the opportunity to play ball, he loses some of the closeness he had been sharing with his dad.  Eddie's friends (the other members of NEATE) decide to help him by trying to figure out why Mr. Delaney is so hard on his son.  What they discover may rekindle the familial bonding in the Delaney household and help the father and son understand one another better.<br /><br />Kelly Starling Lyons has written a book that is very well suited for the target age group.  The characters in the book are realistic and their lives and experiences will mirror the lives of many of the children who read this book. Children will be able to relate to the frustration that Eddie and his friends feel when they are simply misunderstood by the adults in their lives.  In addition, Lyons did an excellent job integrating historical information into the story without taking away the plot's contemporary relevance.  The title, EDDIE'S ORDEAL, seems a bit melodramatic in the context of the story, but isn't melodrama what middle school is all about?<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
A Hero's Journey.	Unfortunately, what many people know about Harriet Tubman is often relegated to a few facts taught during Black History month. \\"The Moses of her people\\" or the \\"Conductor of the Underground Railroad\\" are a few often quoted phrases used when discussing this historic figure. Yet, how many of us honestly know and understand what truly drove Harriet Tubman to do what she did? In the historical biography BOUND FOR THE PROMISE LAND: HARRIET TUBMAN: PORTRAIT OF AN AMERICAN HERO, by Kate Clifford Larson we are given a birds-eye view of the overwhelmingly heartbreaking and dangerous sacrifices Tubman endured to obtain her freedom and that of other enslaved people.<br /><br />Kate Clifford Larson gives insight into Tubman's life by documenting her family history and how she, her mother and siblings were sold and forced to move away from her beloved father. Tubman spent most of her teen years being hired out to different masters; many of these temporary masters were unbelievably cruel to her. It was fear of being sold once more that prompted Tubman to run away using the already established Underground Railroad for help. The love and empathy for family and friends who remained in bondage is what gave Tubman the courage to make trips back into slave territory to and assist her people in escapes. The amount of intelligence, physical stamina and heroism that it took for Tubman to endure during the trips were nothing short of miraculous, especially considering the fact that Tubman was epileptic (caused by being hit in the head by an overseer trying to prevent an escape). Yet, her love of family, justice and God kept her going despite the threat of being caught.<br /><br />Kate Clifford Larson has written a book that is not only a historical biography, but also reads like a work of fiction. Harriet Tubman comes to life in a compelling story of love, loyalty and courage during a horrific period in America's history. Although the tale of Harriet Tubman's life has been documented numerous times before, Larson digs deeper than most other biographers. Harriet's soul and spirituality comes to life in the compelling well documented way that Larson tells it. This is a biography that I believe many will enjoy because it isn't as dry as some historical autobiographies tend to be. Larson takes the reader on Tubman's journey step by step with compelling reality. Throughout the book you could sense Tubman's fear and anxiety as she hears the barking of the bloodhounds on her heels, or feel the pain of the slaves as they run for their very lives. Larson has truly created a worthwhile read.<br /><br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersnumerous times before, Larson digs deeper than most other biographers.

What's in a Reaction?	The phrase \\"September 11\\" makes most of us pause and reflect upon the haunting images surrounding that day's terrible events hauntingly embedded in our minds.  Sometimes we force ourselves not to mentally go back there, but when we allow the memories, we are prone to shudder recalling the attack on The World Trade Center.  Survivor and debut author Ken Greene was courageous enough to pen WHEN THE WALLS CAME DOWN. I thank him for sharing the horrific details he experienced.<br /><br />Greene's book shares personal accounts such as: whenever he hears any one of seven songs he listened to during his commute to work that fateful morning, the music \\"puts me right back on the 6:08 a.m. train headed to Grand Central Terminal\\".  The book is full of these honest, insightful truths which puts the reader in his body and mind.  Reading vivid scenes of being trapped in the stairwell of the tower in which he worked, thinking of his wife, and being covered in soot brought tears to my eyes because his descriptions took me there.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about history, current events, political views, and analytical brainstorming, you will become engrossed as Greene depicts the correlation between obvious routine displays of racism he encounters during his daily commutes, to the 2001 Presidential voting controversy, to Bush's explanation of going to war, and much more.  He has included plenty of research to back up his views. His writing is easy to follow, emotional, very witty, and at times humorous despite the intense subject matter.<br /><br />The fact that the book is more than a memoir of September 11 is what pushes it into the extraordinary class of literature. Greene was employed by the Port Authority of New York as an Assistant Director of Aviation when he found himself thrust into the infamous deadly situation which demanded him to step up and save his life and help rescue others. I recommend this book is placed on your list of must-reads.

More than a Contest	Mattie Black Hawk seems like a typical teenaged girl, but she is haunted by a gruesome past.  After some tragic events, she is adopted at the age of seven by Tykota Black Hawk, she sees him as more than a surrogate parent; he is her protector.  Ty is protective of Mattie, but not so much so that he inhibits her ability to live and grow.  Mattie has a strong interest in dance, and when she learns that a hit television show is offering auditions for new dancers, she decides to enter the contest.  During the contest she is paired with Jarek Thanos, but the immediate attraction between the two suggests that in addition to dancing, there may be romance in the air.  As Mattie and Jarek prepare for the contest, she must decide whether she is willing to share her secret past and trust him.  But the real drama comes in when Ty, as a result of his work with his security agency, learns that the television show and contest are linked to some criminal activity that could put Mattie and everyone else involved with the show in very real danger.  As the mystery unfolds, Mattie will have to use more than her dance skills to survive the contest.<br /><br />With a strong multicultural cast of characters and a diverse plot, DANCE JAM PRODUCTIONS has a little something for everyone.  The book started out slowly, but once it got moving I found myself engaged and eager to see what would happen next.  While some of the supporting characters were a little flat, the author did an excellent job developing Mattie's character; and it is her story that lingered with me even after finishing the book.  Some parents may be a little turned off by the brief mentions of new age religious practices, but there is very little emphasis on this in the story.  This is a book that will appeal to teens with all sorts of interests; from dance, to music, to martial arts, DANCE JAM PRODUCTIONS touches on it all. The story is a good balance between typical teen issues, mystery, and romance.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-02-05
A Dead Woman Walking	The name Mary Jane usually conjures up thoughts of something good and wholesome.  But in DEAD BITCH ARMY by Andre Duza, Mary Jane Mezerak is anything but good and wholesome.  In fact, she isn't even alive.  That's right, she is a gun toting, axe-wielding corpse with a bad attitude.  She is adored and held in the highest esteem by her merry band of renegades.  They believe in her and her cause, which has become twisted from years of hatred mixed with a fanatical desire to extract revenge on her ex-husband.  She has spent years building and training her army, a small troop made up of runaways or individuals she's kidnapped.  One members of her team has special telekinetic powers while the others have a proclivity for cruelty.  They have been responsible for years of gruesome death and destruction among unsuspecting targets.  Yet, in the bigger scheme of things, Mary Jane desires to build an even bigger army of all her true believers in order to change the world.<br /><br />Natasha Armstrong appears to be the only person who knows the truth about Mary Jane, or, more exactly, the only one willing to believe all she's seen about Mary Jane.  Believing that Mary Jane killed her son, Natasha has been seeking revenge for the last twelve years.  During this time, she has entered a world filled with many unexplained oddities that would make any person question his or her sanity.  In fact, the authorities want to question her because they believe she is responsible for the now famous Bloody Mary Murders.  Because of her close proximity to nearly all of the murder scenes and numerous eyewitness accounts, there are many who feel Natasha is responsible for all the horrible deaths. Captured by the cops and condemned by the media, Natasha can only sit back and plan her next attack.  Will she stop Mary Jane?<br /><br />Andre Duza's freshman effort is one totally horrific and bizarre tale about retribution, hatred, justice and all-consuming wrath.  It was hard for me to mentally grasp the concept of a dead person with normal human abilities and seeking revenge, which is why I was not feeling this book at first.  After getting past that and into to the story, I found it to be fast-paced, gory as all get out and a nail biter.  Many of the scenes seemed so real that at one point during the ensuing days after this reading experience, I found myself checking my rearview mirror for a black van pursuing me.  That's just how creepy this book was.  As much as this book got under my skin, I did note a few editorial inconsistencies that caused some distractions. Aside from that, I will mention that the artwork provided in this book was on point and really matched the author's description.

The Sound of Distinction	When most people think of Barry White they remember the smooth, sexy baritone voice, which always seemed to resonate love.  His voice was distinctive and so was his musical style, but his life was a rags-to-riches tale.  LOVE UNLIMITED, written prior to his death, describes Barry's life from the rough streets of Compton, California through his rise to fame as \\"The Maestro\\".  Readers will also get a glimpse into his love of family and his true love, Lady Music.<br /><br />Barry White was raised by a single mother who did all she could to make sure her sons would do well and become successful.  However, it didn't stop them from being acquainted with gangs and spending some time in jail.  Yet, Barry was the only one of her sons to realize that he didn't want to spend his life in jail or become a disappointment to his mother.  The one thing Barry had an affinity for was music.  He loved music and when a spiritual voice came to him one day encouraging him to follow the musical road, he did just that.  Dropping out of high school and on a wing and a prayer, Barry set out for Hollywood to follow his calling.  His road to success was long and hard work.  Even with marriage and a family, he refused to give up his dream.  With the help of friends, support of his mother and pure determination he accomplished much with little formal training.<br /><br />LOVE UNLIMITED gives readers insight into the hard-nosed world of the music industry and Barry White's passion.  He loved his family, took care of his children and when he loved, he loved deeply.  There were lean years before the success and even with success there were problems.  He persevered to follow the spiritual voice that continued to speak to him throughout his life.  His music was an extension of him as a human being.  This was a man of honor who didn't drink, smoke, or party.  He was the epitome of his music.  This was a wonderful and discerning look at The Maestro, as he was often called. There are no scandals to read within the pages, but it is a fulfilling look into Barry's life and the creative power behind his music.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerso read within the pages, but it is a fulfilling look into Barry's life and the creative power behind his music. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
Is Anything Sacred	Natalie Thomas thought that Divine Baptist Church was the answer to her prayers.  She had been searching for a church in Chicago that would feed her mind and spirit and this church seemed to provide all that and then some.  The icing on the cake was Pastor Kevin Lewis who was not only a good spiritual leader, but also easy on the eyes.  Every now and then she would hear or see something that made her think twice, but she would ignore them because after all she had finally found her spiritual home.  Now, if only God would send her a man...<br /><br />A job opportunity emerges that forces Natalie to relocate to New York.  While she was a bit apprehensive about the move, she jumped at the whirlwind opportunity.  At this point, Reverend Lewis begins to demonstrate an interest in her that is anything but spiritual.  The two find themselves in a long distance relationship that puts Natalie's morals to the test.  Wrought with passion, drama and spiritual challenges, THE SACRED SERMON will take readers on a wild ride.<br /><br />THE SACRED SERMON is fast-paced and has a strong plot with several interesting caveats.  While I enjoyed the book, I found myself wishing for a deeper understanding of the characters.  With further character development, I am almost certain I would have given this book a five-star rating.  The author addressed Natalie's background a little, but not to the extent that I could really understand and relate to her actions.  Kevin's character was even more of an enigma.  As I read the story, I never got any insight into his motivations nor his background.  However, the author is planning a sequel, so maybe some of the unanswered questions will be revealed in the next book.

A Better Work Environment	It takes all types of people to make the world go round, or so they say.  Have you ever had to deal with a co-worker who had the innate ability to dance on the very last nerve that you had left?  What about that big crybaby who sits across from you and would get a lot more work done if she would just stop her dang whining and get to work?  Well, if you ever had to endure the working world and its inhabitants, then you may want to acquire Sarah Kaip's THE WORKING WOMAN'S WORKPLACE SURVIVAL GUIDE.<br /><br />In this guide, Ms. Kaip analyzes relationships amongst co-workers based on personality types.  For instance, we have the Prima Donna group who believe that they are God's \\"gift to the corporate world\\" and that the Earth rotates around them.  Basically, Prima Donnas are the ones who love all the glory - they can talk the talk but they can't walk the walk and, oftentimes, they pass the buck when it comes to getting work done.  As with all of her personality descriptions, Ms. Kaip offers a solution to dealing with the Prima Donnas.  She advises that if we have to deal with a Prima Donna type in our workplace, then it would be up to us to create a boundary as to what type of behaviors we're willing to accept.  Kaip addresses six personality characteristics and offers up good, sound advice for dealing with them.  When I read the very first sentence of the \\"Complainers and Whiners\\" section, I found myself saying \\"Damn!\\" because Ms. Kaip states that the \\"very problem that they (whiners and complainers) exist is the problem.\\"<br /><br />The other major sections of the book are \\"Surviving Bosses\\" and \\"Surviving Yourself.\\"  Each section is as enlightening as the first.  By her writing style, it is evident that Ms. Kaip has done her homework.  As a human resources professional, the concepts presented to me in this book were not anything new, however, Ms. Kaip's presentation framed them in a new, entertaining manner.  She laces the book with pearls of advice such as \\"influence others to be positive\\" and \\"don't be afraid to apologize\\".  The one caveat to this book is that I would have liked for the author to reference her sources when citing statistical data.  For instance, the \\"Asking for a Raise\\" chapter utilized a great deal of statistical information and I would have liked to have had the opportunity to reference her sources.  All in all, Ms. Kaip has penned an informative read that could apply to anyone in the workplace, whether male or female.

It's time to re-evaluate...	What would you do if your spouse or significant other absolutely forbade you to do something that you're set on doing?  Would you acquiesce to their demand, or would you take a stand and follow your heart?<br /><br />In AlTonya Washington's FINDING LOVE AGAIN, Lawrencia DeZhabi finds herself in this predicament.  She wants desperately to work outside the home, but her husband Ivan is adamantly opposed to her doing so, and basically refuses to stand by her when she goes against his wishes.  This understandably causes conflict which results in the couple separating.  Even though Ivan and Lawrencia still love each other, they remain separated for many months.  Each must come to terms with the other's point of view, and resolve all of the issues hindering their return to a happy marriage.<br /><br />FINDING LOVE AGAIN was a good story.  The underlying message of taking a stand for what you believe in and not sacrificing your happiness for the sake of others hit home for me in many ways.  However, I did have a problem with the fact that it was overly descriptive and was quite repetitive, which made for a long, drawn out, tedious read.  There should have been less focus on the physical attributes of the couple and their surroundings and more time spent developing the storyline, which could have really been explosive.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
What Am I Without You?	Close in age and practically raised together in Brooklyn, Jordan Baez and Jason McCoy were more like siblings than niece and uncle.  Though they led very different lives as children and adults, their bond remained steadfast and strong until the end.  When Jay moved from Brooklyn to Richmond, Virginia, Jordan assumed that Uncle Jay got out of the game and became a successful entrepreneur.  When he is gunned down, Jordan begins to have recollections and strange nightmares about her life with Uncle Jay that ultimately leads to surprising discoveries about his life and his death.<br /><br />Throughout the story we are introduced to characters that Blount has developed to tell a complete story.  We become familiar with these family members and friends, and more than likely can identify with some of them.  She presents this story and the characters in a fashion that brings you nearer to their hearts, their joy and pain.  Blount showcases each character in a unique role that is opposite from the role of their close counterpart.  This is what makes her writing very good: the ability to show the connection and realism of two very different people, leading very different lives.<br /><br />Laced with a few Biblical references and the power of prayer, Uncle Jay becomes a somewhat kindred spirit for Jordan, which gives her the strength to move on with her life.  He spoke to her from the grave giving her peace of mind to proceed.  Aside from a few spelling errors and a missing link within the relationship, Tonya Blount's story of the relationship of a writer and the bond she shared with a hustling uncle captures the spirit of the love of family and ties that bind.

Confusion at every turn...	When you're at home during the day, do you find yourself glued to the television for hours on end as you watch soap operas or the many court shows that inundate the airwaves?  Does the drama of other people's lives keep you enthralled?  If so, author Michelle DeLeon has written just the book for you.<br /><br />ONCE UPON A FAMILY TREE is rife with infidelity, homosexuality and dysfunction of the greatest magnitude. Yolara, a high school student, finds herself smack dab in the middle of all the drama.  On one hand, she has issues with her father.  On the other hand, she has feelings for someone who her mind tells her she shouldn't have feelings for, but her heart says otherwise.  For good measure, murder and mayhem also become a part of Yolara's already complicated life.<br /><br />Even though I've had my fill of books full of drama, Ms. DeLeon did manage to create a story that held my attention from beginning to end.  The drama was slightly over the top in some aspects, but underneath it, the author conveyed a deep sense of familial love and support that I really didn't expect.  The major problem I had with this book is that I felt as if I were left hanging on some of the situations.  A scene would end abruptly, and when it picked up later in the story, it had already been resolved, without any reference to the actual resolution.  Other than that, I found this to be an okay read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
A Mystery Lover's Dream	Are you bored, with nothing on your bookshelf that will stimulate your mind and activate your imagination? If the answer is yes, then SHADES OF BLACK could be the book for you. This anthology features over 20 stories by various African-American writers of the Mystery genre.<br /><br />I am an avid reader and mystery is one of my favorite genres so I'm always on the lookout for something to get my mysterious juices flowing and SHADES OF BLACK did this for me. Usually when someone speaks of a good suspenseful novel, Walter Mosley and maybe two or three other authors immediately come to mind. With this anthology, I was exposed to a wealth of African-American mystery writers who are prominent in the literary scene today. My favorite contribution to this collection was \\"The Werewolf File\\" by Hugh Holton. This story involved a murderous and vengeful werewolf and three very colorful detectives. The attention to detail and the author's writing was so vivid I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.<br /><br />SHADES OF BLACK is a great example of the talented mystery writers who are on the literary scene today and their works are a welcomed change from predictable stories with very little mental challenge. This anthology has me anxious to check out the works of the authors who were not familiar to me.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
What's Done In The Dark Always Comes To Light	The first thing that came to mind when I saw the title of this book was \\"not another baby momma drama story \\", but much to my surprise that wasn't the case at all. CHILD SUPPORT AND OTHER GUARANTEES by Laverne Lewis Gaskins is essentially a book about relationships, friendship and successful careers.<br /><br />The first time Olga saw Jason she wanted to know all she could about the fine black Adonis who was at her fingertips. He too, was checking her out and couldn't wait to get the scoop on the beautiful woman before him. Jason was a very successful business executive who had everything he needed except a wife by his side. Jason always had his head in the books and was determined to become successful inspite of his impoverished childhood. Olga was a successful accountant who had a strong spiritual foundation and two supportive friends. The only thing lacking in her life was a mate to share it with. When Jason saw Olga, at a party he knew she was what he was looking for in a wife.<br /><br />After a brief whirlwind romance, Olga and Jason marry and feel their lives can't get any better. Jason may be successful and fine but due to his impoverished upbringing he is also very insecure.  Olga is realizing that her knight in shining armor isn't all he is cracked up to be.  He also has more than a few unpleasant characteristics as well as some business dealings that aren't too legit. The man she fell in love with is nowhere to be found and the person he has become no one likes, not even Jason himself. Can the love they once shared be rekindled or is Olga fed up and ready to move on?<br /><br />In addition to Jason and Olga's story we meet Precious and Tamika, who have been best friends since childhood. They are inseparable and both have a few skeletons in their closet Precious, a single mother of two sons would do anything to get the love of her life, Carlos, back. She is determined to have him for herself by any means necessary. Every since he walked out on her a few years ago, her life hasn't been the same. Will she be successful in her endeavor? What made Carlos leave in the first place? Tamika is a single mother of one with one on the way. She isn't in a relationship and hasn't been for some time. The secret identity of the father of her children can never be revealed, and as long as he is taking care of his responsibilities all things are kosher. Will the fathers of their children continue to support them? Or will Tamika and Precious end up taking care of their children without any support? A few bones start to fall out of their closets and trouble is not far behind. Can these two keep their past under wraps or will the old saying \\"what's done in the dark always comes to light\\" hold true?<br /><br />CHILD SUPPORT AND OTHER GUARANTEES is a book that delves into the areas of friendships and failed relationships with just a touch of drama. I enjoyed reading the book but I felt as if I was reading two separate stories. The majority of the book was about Jason and Olga with just a touch of Tamika and Precious thrown in. The two stories didn't really connect and the attempt at the end to intertwine them just didn't work. I honestly think the stories would have worked better being in two separate books. In spite of this, overall it was an enjoyable read that ended with an unsuspected twist.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

A Love Story	Perhaps one of the most well-known and beautiful of the biblical stories is that of the birth of Jesus. The story as we are told begins with an Angel relaying a message to Mary regarding a miracle that will forever change her, the world and the faith of millions. This blessed event has been read about, celebrated, debated and re-enacted throughout the centuries. Author Nathan A. Lewis has taken on the daunting task of re-telling the story by delving into the relationships between Mary, Joseph and Jesus. In JOSEPH & MARY: A Love Story, Lewis chronicles the courtship of the two from the immaculate conception to the raising of Jesus. Lewis also deviates from the biblical story by setting his novel in the modern world.<br /><br />As with any re-telling of a known story, the present author carries a great burden. Although Lewis does not stray from the original message of love, family, and faith, he does not make the story his own either. It would have been great if there were more in-depth probing of the possible feelings that Joseph and Mary had for one another, their reaction to raising the child of God and the relationship they had with Jesus.  As a work of fiction, there was a license to truly do more of a re-telling than to simply re-cast the characters in the 21st century. The scene where Joseph learns that his supposedly virginal fianc&eacute;e is carrying a child that is not his, but also claiming the child to be that of God,  could have been dramatic and heartfelt, yet I found it a bit unemotional and flat.<br /><br />I find the biblical version beautiful and heartfelt. I didn't see it here. I do think that JOSEPH & MARY: A Love Story would be a good supplement to the teaching of the biblical story, for it is told in a straightforward manner, and being set in the modern world gives the story a bit of a more personal feel and it is easy to comprehend. However, as a novel,  it unfortunately, falls short. The dialogue  and interactions between the characters just felt too restricted and unemotional for such a grand story of love and faith.

After receiving evidence of her husband's indiscretions with not one, but two women, she disregards her mother's words and takes matters into her own hands.<br /><br />As chance would have it, Aliette Pearly walks into Sinclair's life at a vulnerable moment.  Sinclair recognizes her as one of the women who ruined her marriage and sets her plan for revenge in motion.  Sinclair befriends her with the ulterior motive of ruining her, but with Aliette's destructive behavior and troubled past, she may self-destruct.<br /><br />Stephanie Johnson has penned a drama-filled novel that could put any daytime soap opera to shame.  SHE'S GOT ISSUES is a sexually charged, over-the-edge mix of drama and romance, and I could not get enough.  There is also an underlying message of forgiveness, which was a key factor in the characters overcoming their issues.  There were a few editorial issues, but aside from that I enjoyed the novel and have recommended it to friends and family.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-02-05
Overloading the Praise Wagon	Can there ever be too much praise for a writer?  Well, if there is such a thing, Barbara Hambly is going to be in trouble.  WET GRAVE is a historical mystery/adventure novel that takes places in New Orleans, the barrier islands of Barataria Bay and the riverfront plantations of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.<br /><br />Living amongst the gens de couleur libre (free people of color) in the early 1800's, former slave Benjamin January is suffering through the summer doldrums of New Orleans, while the Creole elite have fled to cooler spots on the planet and the uncivilized Americans drink and brawl their way through the dog days of summer.  Amidst the heat, humidity and carnivorous mosquitoes, the former mistress of a long dead pirate captain is murdered at the same time as a rich white planter.  The authorities have no problem investigating the murder of the white man, but have callously ignored the murder of a poor, displaced black prostitute.  Ben, as usual, takes it upon himself to ferret out Hessy's killer and finds himself caught between a slave rebellion and a hurricane - literally!<br /><br />Surrounded by women, Ben is also caught up in the mini-dramas of his mother, his sister, and his companion, Rose, who all look to him for support during difficult times.  Fortunately for Ben, Rose is more independent than his female relatives and rides out the adventure at his side.  But even his sister, Dominique, surprises him, when she demonstrates a depth of character and surprising fortitude.<br /><br />Barbara Hambly delivers everything you would ever want to experience in a novel - mystery, suspense, adventure, and romance - all in a flawlessly researched package.  WET GRAVE is the sixth installment of the Benjamin January mystery series.  Although it is the first of Hambly's works that I have read, I was not deterred by starting in the middle of the series.  In fact, it just whets my appetite to go back and start the series from the beginning.  WET GRAVE is excellent fiction supported by excellent historical research.

All Hail The Queen	Vyolet Shelby is a very successful fitness club owner  who has it going on. Men are at her beck and call and will do anything to get a chance to prove themselves worthy of her company. Vyolet's favorite color is purple, the symbol for royalty, which is appropriate because she considers herself a queen and takes a no holds barred approach to life. She gets what she wants, when she wants it and how she wants it. Surrounded by loving friends, Vyolet's life appears to be the epitome of happiness, but as the old cliche goes \\"all that glitters isn't gold.\\"<br /><br />Although men and women admire Vyolet, she is selective about who she allows into her inner circle. A few people she comes in contact with aren't too keen on taking no for an answer and are dead set on making Vyolet their personal queen. Vyolet becomes a victim of stalking and encounters a near death experience which causes her to lose her tough exterior but only momentarily.<br /><br />There is light at the end of the tunnel as there is one man, Nico, who falls in love with Vyolet immediately. She knows he is a good catch, but because she has been hurt so many times in the past she can't allow herself to open her heart, or can she? Can Nico be the one to soften Vyolets' hardened heart? Or will the lies, deceit and betrayal from others allow her to cut herself off from those she loves and toughen her up even more?<br /><br />Tanishah Chisam's debut novel PURPOSELY PURPLE was an enjoyable yet puzzling read. Enjoyable in that Vyolet was a young, strong entrepreneur who knew how to have fun. It was puzzling in that there were too many secondary characters that I couldn't keep up with who was who. In addition, some of the drama was a bit over the top even for a fiction novel. There were other instances where I was left hanging and wasn't provided enough information to resolve different situations. All in all, PURPOSELY PURPLE was an average read that would have been much better if it didn't have so much going on. (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Inspiring...	Montana St. Claire has a lot going in her life, which includes raising her young daughter alone, dealing with people on the job, and getting over her first love.  However, her biggest problem is that Satan is after her soul and uses every vice known to trick her into turning towards him.  Fortunately, Montana is secure in her faith and knows that God is the head of her life and the source of her happiness and success.  But, just as expected in the real world, a few curve balls, heartaches, and feelings of doubt surface and threaten the balance on which she's built her life.<br /><br />Her co-worker has it out for her and uses her own friend to ensure Montana's downfall.  The love of her life has returned, supposedly a changed man and missing the characteristics of the culprit responsible for breaking her heart.  There is also a secret she's been withholding that may change not only her life, but that of her daughter, possibly for the worse.  Through these situations and others, Montana fights to maintain her sanity and conviction in the Spirit.<br /><br />In an original twist of casting Satan and God as characters in the book, Marcelle Morgan Payne has given the readers an extra depth with her story.  The fight between good and evil is clearly demonstrated through not only the actions of the characters, but the circumstances in which they find themselves.  There is a potpourri of manipulation, chaos, and pain inflicted on the characters, but the good is also shown as Montana struggles to live true to her Christian teachings.  DEGREES OF GRACE is an inspiring and endearing story of the power of God's Word and the blessings bestowed upon those who do believe.  Fast-paced and moving, while at the same time witty and uplifting, DEGREES OF GRACE is a welcome addition the Christian Fiction genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Tomorrow is Not Promised	Many of us walk around day after day being consumed by life's little dramas and end up missing out on some of the more important things like love and companionship.  Not to mention the folks who are mad about irrational things and those who are consumed by insecurities that prevent them from going after their heart's desires.  These people are just wasting time.  And that is the theme Zane focuses on in her latest release, AFTERBURN.<br /><br />Rayne and Yardley eye each other at the bank where Rayne works on a daily basis, but it is months of wasted time and outrageous dating shenanigans before they finally hook up with each other.  Once they do, though, it is a match made in heaven and they both realize how futile and empty their lives were without each other.  Zane also examines the twin forces of friendship and betrayal, commitment and temptation, and faith and doubt through an ensemble cast of friends and family.<br /><br />Zane has provided her readers with an exceptional plot infused with some of the most erotic sex imaginable.  This is my first time reading one of her novels, and while few authors live up to the hype surrounding them, Zane actually surpassed my expectations.  Her work is thoughtful, hilarious, sexy, and inventive.

Aided by his devoted servant and freed slave, Uncle Peter, the Colonel makes a life for himself and his young son in the town of Clarendon and works toward making it a prosperous place to live for both blacks and whites.  Unfortunately, everyone is not on his side and the powers-that-be are only interested in maintaining the status quo.  It is the Colonel's valiant efforts to lay the foundation for a progressive community that moves the action in this novel and provides the reader with a certain sense of ethos, humanity, and encouragement to see this novel to its final conclusion.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kim Anderson Ray<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-31
Sharing Secret Desires	What is your biggest sexual fantasy?  Would you share it with someone else?  Or is it a secret held tight within the recesses of your dreams? In BROWN SUGAR 4: Secret Desires, Carol Taylor has assembled an impressive list of award-winning authors and mixed in others on the verge of their literary careers.  These authors share their own versions of secret desires in this collection of erotic stories, the fourth and final installment in the Brown Sugar anthologies.<br /><br />In reading erotica, one must first define the term and then realize the definition varies per individual.  Though I didn't find many of the stories overly erotic, they were well-written and captured a range of writing styles crossing the spectrum from literary to street to almost poetic.  Some showcased forbidden desires such as the preacher's wife, a family member's spouse, and even a lover outside of marriage.  Others touched on moving friendship to an intimate level and stories of crossing race and social status boundaries established by parents or society.<br /><br />My favorite story was Brandon Massey's \\"Ghostwriter\\" in which a horror writer visits a cemetery for inspiration after suffering through writer's block.  I loved the originality, unpredictability, and subtleness of the story.  A few others I enjoyed were Gar Anthony Haywood's \\"Where He's Getting it Now,\\" \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" written by jessica Care moore, and \\"My Brother's Wife\\" by asha bandele.  I've never read works by any of these authors, but look forward to doing so.<br /><br />While reading BROWN SUGAR 4, I was more drawn to the actual writing of the contributors.  Most of the stories were more appealing to the literary lover in me and less to the sensual side hiding in my fantasies. I was, however, pleased to see romance and sensuality displayed instead of graphic sex.  Yet, I was a bit shocked by some of the stories which crossed the border of being morally wrong as it pertains to my own beliefs.  In spite of this, it was easy for me to fall back on one small thing: in most cases, secret desires remain a secret and may or may not be thought of as unobtainable, unacceptable, or simply unapproachable because we're afraid of the outcome.<br /><br />Though a bit odd for a collection, the introduction actually stood out more than any of the stories.  It was easy to see the passion Ms. Taylor has for her work on the Brown Sugar books and her writing itself is sensual, crisp, and poetic.  And, though this is the end of her Brown Sugar series, I look forward to one day reading a collection of her writing and commend her on gathering together a medley of authors to showcase their individual styles of writing.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Repatriation	In this thought-provoking, autobiographical narrative, American born Larry Ukali Johnson-Redd  reminisces on his life's experiences in 1960s and 1970s America and  his subsequent migration to Nigeria.<br /><br />Interspersed with poetry written by the author, JOURNEY TO THE MOTHERLAND tells of Ukali's high school and college years, when he was an active member of the Black Student Union and recounts some of the trials he had to contend with as a student activist in an inherently racist American society.  It touches on  his involvement in riots and protests that were commonplace during that period of America's racist history and describes how he falls in love with his wife at first sight.  It is his wife, a Nigerian, who informs him of a job opportunity in Nigeria, just when the biased American system threatens to stifle his ability to become gainfully employed, despite his qualifications.<br /><br />Disillusioned by the blatant racism perpetrated against \\"Afroans\\" in America, he seizes the opportunity and migrates to Nigeria where he is offered the chance to work with the school system.  It is there in Nigeria that the author feels he is accorded the human respect and dignity he rightly deserves.  His obvious devotion and love for his very supportive wife is clearly evident throughout the book.<br /><br />JOURNEY TO THE MOTHERLAND is a sentimental story of one man's determination to maintain his self-respect and esteem.  Ukali's story is an interesting one and though it lacks detail and depth, it is presented in a clear and easy to read format.  JOURNEY TO THE MOTHERLAND  is an enlightening read which covers a gamut of complex  issues surrounding race relations and voluntary repatriation.  It offers readers a taste of African culture and its apparent respect for diversity.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-31
A love triangle gone bad	In a loving relationship, sometimes things can get a bit boring, predictable, and repetitive.  Partners find themselves in need of adding a little bit of spice to their lives, specifically in the bedroom.  What woman loves her man enough to yield to his requests, no matter how much she doesn't really want to do what he desires?  Especially sexually.  Tough decision, huh?  Well, throw in the factors of your once loving husband turning into a 5-minute brother, that he just doesn't seem that into you lately, and you're not quite sure where the passion has gone.  Makes you reconsider, huh?  Better to do a bit of experimenting than lose your man to another woman, right?  Well, this is the premise to the book MY WOMAN HIS WIFE by Anna J in which the main character Jasmine Cinque is asked by her husband James to perform a threesome with another woman.  After repeated refusals, she finally agrees, setting the Cinque household on a crash course to disaster.<br /><br />Monica is the woman brought in to carry on this once-in-a-lifetime tryst.  Beautiful, sensitive, and sweet, she seems to be exactly what the doctor ordered to get the couple's sex life back in working order.  She expertly uses her sensuality and honed skills in the bedroom to draw Jasmine into a web of eroticism she's never experienced, with James bringing up the rear to a night she'll never forget.  A bit shocked at the pleasure another woman can give her and that her 5-minute brother has turned into a love-making machine, Jasmine is happy with the decision to go through with the threesome.  Unfortunately, that happiness is a bit short-lived as she starts sneaking out on the side to get just one more fix of Monica.  Monica falls for Jasmine and does everything in her power to show her the love and care she has for her, not only through sex.  She does, however, show a different, needy, jealous, vindictive side,  set on getting Jasmine for herself.  Her plan is to destroy James and take his place in Jasmine's life.<br /><br />Talking about scandalous?  Umph umph umph! That is just the beginning of this hot, fast-paced novel which is meant to be read in one sitting.  My only disappointments with the book were a few minor editorial issues and the actual ending.  I really felt the story could've been wrapped up instead of leaving it open for a sequel.  But, I will definitely be reading it when it is released.  It is erotic, well-planned and executed, and a must read for lovers of erotica.  Though the characters have flaws, you're able to fully understand why they're the way they are and empathize with them.  At various points I found myself talking out loud, laughing, and taking a few notes of my own.  Monica was one bad chick and a maniac to boot!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Discovering what's really there...	Newcomer Evie Rhodes has quickly established herself in the literary arena with her debut title EXPIRED.  Known as an award-winning songwriter and music video scriptwriter, her foray into the literary world is sure to bring her to top levels of the media because of the genre in which it is written.  Though a few horrific events occur, it's not necessarily horror, nor is it the typical contemporary fiction book.  She has presented readers with a new type of read...a supernatural/psychological thriller that not only entertains, but evokes deep thought on living, life, and the good in each of us.<br /><br />Tracie Burlingame is known around her Harlem neighborhood, mainly because of her successful beauty salon which caters to wealthy women across the city.  Though she's a single mother, she has crawled to the top of the social ladder and established herself as an entrepreneur; sometimes at the expense of her four sons.  With her main focus on acquiring money and more success, she's hard-nosed, self-centered, and a bit uncaring in her dealings with others.  However, when two of her sons are killed, it soon becomes obvious that a serial killer is on the prowl and he has it out for Tracie and her offspring.<br /><br />The killer, who isn't working alone, is on a deadly mission to milk the African-American community of Harlem of its history, heritage and hope for the future.  Not only are Tracie's remaining sons at risk, but others are being singled out as well--those with extraordinary skills.  The scariest part of all this is that there is a master plan in the works and the supernatural forces revolving around Harlem are set on exacting chaos.<br /><br />The book is a terrifying, yet thrilling read which teaches that with just a little faith, unspeakable actions can take place.  It strongly showcases a mother's struggle with herself and her demons, the injustices the street can bring, and the consequences of not doing right.  Additionally, the reader is presented with the softer side of Tracie, in which her love for her children and her self-inspection assists in alerting her of the evil around her. Occasionally, there are books which arrive in the mail that I instantly know I have to read, no matter what.  EXPIRED was such a book because of not only the uniqueness of the storyline, but also because it is the author's very first title.  I simply love anticipating the release of the work of a new author and was thoroughly satisfied with EXPIRED.  The messages embedded in the pages speak volumes on life and cherishing those people and gifts one is blessed with.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A search for the truth...	The U.S. Secretary of Commerce and other government officials have been sent to identify the level of economic aid needed to help in the devastation left by the AIDS virus in Central and Southern Africa.  A staff of bodyguards and military are on hand to ensure their safety.  Among the entourage is Alex Deavers, and as they are headed back home with a deadly secret sold to the secretary in their possession, their truck explodes.  Deavers narrowly escapes death, but not before grabbing the suitcase. This leaves him on the run for his life and on a mission to gather the additional information needed to complete the puzzle and right a wrong.  However, it wasn't in the plans for Deavers to escape the explosion and now he's been identified as a rogue agent.<br /><br />Luther Green is a trained assassin hired out by E-1, a secret department of the U.S. government. Though no one acknowledges its existence, E-1 originated in the CIA.  Their primary mission is to rid the world of bad guys - particularly those who threaten the security of the United States.  Luther has been called in to take on the hardest case of his life.  He must kill Deavers, who just happens to be the man who taught him everything he knows.  He's given the mission and sets out to accomplish it, despite his personal feelings for his friend and mentor.  Through the cat and mouse chase that occurs once he tracks Deavers, Luther begins to question not only his capability in catching his former trainer, but he also begins to question his own humanity and realizes he has given up the possibility of a normal life to serve as an assassin.  Deavers manages to stay ahead of him, but leaves clues along the way which plant seeds of doubt as to the full validity and scope of the mission Luther has been assigned.<br /><br />Finding out who he really is deep inside and battling with the rule book of his chosen profession are constant obstacles for Luther.  When he is lead to his hometown of Detroit, he is faced with the safety of his family who become pawns in the operation.  With high-speed chases throughout various major cities, hand-to-hand combat, the good guy back-up when things get sticky, and a host of weapons and gadgets, Gary Hardwick's newest thriller, THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME is without a doubt a page-to-page thrill ride.  The scenes are vivid, the characters are intense, and suspense surrounds every movement of the characters.  The ending was completely unexpected and speaks to the racial injustices prevalent in society, including the government.<br /><br />Hardwick has clearly used his expertise as a film director and screenwriter to pen a novel displaying an extra level of intensity that a lot of authors are incapable of pulling off.  I enjoyed THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME and look forward to seeing it on the big screen and can already see the intended lead, Jamie Foxx, playing the role of Luther Green.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A Happy Heart is Good Medicine	A bankrupt spirit is a spirit that has been broken by life's trials and tribulations.  Author Vivi Monroe Congress states how grief and misery manifests in our lives and how well we deal with these things is totally dependent on our response to the situation.  In other words, it is imperative to keep everything in perspective.  When we continue to dwell in a downtrodden state, this affects God's creditworthiness in the eyes of our naysayers.  It also reiterates the fact that as a Christian believer, we should steadfastly praise God despite the circumstances.<br /><br />In THE BANKRUPT SPIRIT, Congress adeptly cites many Biblical references throughout the text to positively enforce her message of having a motivatal outlook.  She reminds us that during challenging times, it is imperative that we keep our spiritual guard up and break the chains of bondage that steal away our joy.  God doesn't give us more than we can bear, therefore, we must trust Him to see us through our valley experiences.  To break the bonds of spiritual bankruptcy, we must first get real with ourselves by unearthing all of our bad habits and negative influences.  As stated in Jeremiah 29:11, God wants us to prosper.  He gives us hope and arms us with a plan for the future.<br /><br />In THE BANKRUPT SPIRIT, Congress takes us on a journey from spiritual bankruptcy to spiritual wealth and healing, by providing a systematic approach of realization, acceptance and growth.  The flowing manner in which she writes will immediately draw the reader into her message and will cause reflection.  One thing I especially liked was that a summary listing of all the scriptures quoted in the text was provided in the end.  In my opinion, this is a wonderful study tool to utilize when examining the scriptures for yourself.  No matter the denomination or Christian affiliation, THE BANKRUPT SPIRIT will be a blessing to its readers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-27

Sisterhood	DELTA GIRLS is a touching anthology of short stories from a collection of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority members that spans across a broad range of age and experience.  The short stories contained within DELTA GIRLS are a testament of love, encouragement, perseverance and postivity. Even if you're not a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the bonds of sisterhood that ring from the pages will pull on your heart strings.<br /><br />One of my favorite stories in the book was simply entitled The Shoes by Sharari G. Moore.  This was a story of how one soror helped another overcome adversity in her darkest hour and seek hope and guidance from the Lord.  Each short story is uniquely written and conveys its own message, yet each has the underlying bond of friendship, esteem and sisterhood laced through its words.  All in all, the acronym T.R.U.N.K as cited in the piece with the same title by Tiffany Boyattia, sums up the whole sense of sisterhood conveyed in this book - Truthful, Reliable, Understanding, Noble and Kind.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-27

Most important what stands out is the way the author allows each poem to stand alone with sentiment and understanding. His poetic style is unique because after reading each selection I felt he put great thought and reflection into each line.<br /><br />WAIT THE WATER FALL reminds me of a water fall with water cascading down in rhythm with the beat of the splash making you feel refreshed and lively.

When she catches her boyfriend in their bed with one of her friends, she decides that infidelity is too high a price to pay for her current lifestyle and throws him out.

With very little cash and a lot of bills to pay, Sarai must make some difficult decisions about what she is willing to do for money.  To complicate matters, she develops a new love interest and the secrets to her financial success may be enough to destroy their relationship.<br /><br />Trista Russell is a talented new author.  From the opening line of the book, it is evident that if nothing else, she knows how to capture the reader's attention.  She uses interesting plot twists, graphic sex scenes, and diverse characters to transform a relatively predictable storyline into a surprisingly enjoyable read.  The story reminds readers of just how quickly one bad decision can spiral into an unfortunate series of events.

First the love of her life, her fianc&eacute;, gave her an ultimatum that resulted in their separation; then the other love of her life, her job as a police officer, is taken from her when she is injured and put on disability leave. Just when it seems things couldn't get worse, her former fianc&eacute; Dillon Upshur, a.k.a. Duck, is missing. Not only is he missing, but there are rumors circulating around the police force that he stole evidence (drugs) and that he is using. And let's not forget about the dead body found locked in her apartment.<br /><br />Leigh knows Duck. He was an honorable cop and wanted nothing to do with drugs. How his disappearance and the dead body are tied together, she doesn't know, but intends to find out.  After initial digging, she discovers that his past isn't all he'd told her it was. Her belief is shaken, yet she sets out to find the whole truth.<br /><br />Chassie West has written a fantastic mystery filled with twists and turns without becoming convoluted. Even though I generally knew what the ending would be, it was fun watching how she'd get there. And the characterization... She included a large cast of characters who worked well together. Each had his/her own voice, humor and style.  I missed this series when it was originally released in 2000. Boy am I glad I didn't miss it this go around.

A grand mystery	Set in Memphis, Tennessee in the late 60s, GRAND JURY CONNECTIONS is a drama<br /><br />filled adventure which touches on many of the social problems of the time<br /><br />period.  The draft, police brutality, and civil rights are a few of the topics<br /><br />that are dealt with in this mystery.<br /><br />The story is centered around Walter Pruitt, a high school senior, who is<br /><br />accused of murdering a police officer who has a long history of brutal<br /><br />behavior toward blacks.  Walter is found unconscious near the dead officer<br /><br />after fleeing a near arrest.  Walter remembers nothing about the night of the<br /><br />murder except for running from the cop.  He has no history of arrests and is a<br /><br />good student who had a bright future before the incident.  As history shows,<br /><br />Walter is in a life-changing predicament as a young black man accused of<br /><br />murdering a white policeman in 1967.  Walter's life is turned upside down as<br /><br />he rides the roller coaster of the investigation into the murder.<br /><br />Moore and Vaughn paint a vivid picture of life in Memphis during this era.<br /><br />Their attention to detail is commendable as they give each character in this<br /><br />saga equal time and developed them fully with helpful back story.  The<br /><br />details can get a little tedious at times which slows down the reading of the<br /><br />story, but you will walk away from the tale with a full sense of who each<br /><br />character is.<br /><br />GRAND JURY CONNECTIONS is more than a mystery, but a study of race relations<br /><br />in the South during a particularly turbulent time in history.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Naylorism	\\"No, my work is not about giving answers...But my work is just the highlight, and I pray to God that it brings to life just a tiny little bit of the reality that I see through my vision.\\" - Conversations with Gloria Naylor, pp. 69<br /><br />I chose to begin this review on CONVERSATIONS WITH GLORIA NAYLOR with a quote by the esteemed author for many reasons. However, I mainly begin here because this collection of interviews is about her: her stories, her life, her decisions, her thoughts, and her characters, so it's only fitting to begin a book about her with a quote by her.  While there are many quotes by Naylor in this book that I could have used, I like this one to start because it shows readers where her focus is.  So many contemporary African-American novels try to show us the \\"how to\\" in life, offering readers many authors' \\"Black-shaped\\" cookie cutter answers to all that life throws us. Naylor is among the few who differ.  Instead of answers, she gives us situations, tastes of what she sees and the realities of characters who use her as a medium to reach the world.<br /><br />CONVERSATIONS WITH GLORIA NAYLOR is a collection of personal and professional interviews about everything from her characters' realities to her own life situations.  Readers learn about why Naylor became a Jehovah's Witness, what got her started writing, what compelled her to finish each novel, and what connected the novels.  We also learn about her family situation growing up, the jobs she's held, who she esteems, and how she views herself and the world in which she lives.<br /><br />Ever since I studied Mama Day  at university, I've been a big fan of Gloria Naylor. Reading this collection has simultaneously fulfilled and augmented my desire to know more about her.  While quite a few of the interviews seemed to be repetitive in information, Naylor offers a little something different in each piece.  Her witty answers punctuate through the most mundane questions, and her social awareness stamps everything she does.  Her conversation with Toni Morrison really reflects both women's love of writing and love for the African-American culture.  We are truly blessed to have such a writer as Gloria Naylor in our midst.

After attending the wedding of Imani, the love of Damon's life, DeAndra realizes that Damon would never love her with the same intensity.  Although she had been in love with Damon since she was fifteen years old, she knew falling out of love would not be easy.  So, she began her life over in a different city hoping to get over her love for Damon.<br /><br />When our hero and heroine end up in the same city two years after their emotional parting, old and new feelings for one another start to surface.  Damon finds himself in Chicago because of a mystery stalker, and he literally comes to the aid of DeAndra.  Their need for each other brings the couple together for more than safety, but will they actually fall in love again?<br /><br />FALLING by Natalie Dunbar is a bittersweet romance with a touch of mystery and a few tangles to unravel.  The characters seem genuine and the storyline plausible, but predictable.  As with all romances, it follows the formula, but readers get added suspense and intrigue as they try to discover Damon's stalker.  The one regret I have with this story is that it is short and we don't really get to know the main characters in depth.  Romance lovers will enjoy the heat of passion with this couple.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
It's getting hot in here...	There's nothing better than coming home from a hard day's work (or even in the middle of the day if you like a little spice in your life) and having your spouse or significant other treat you to some serious, hot and heavy TLC.  If only for a little while, the cares of the world take a back seat to everything as you are treated to satisfaction of the most intimate nature.  If you don't have someone to curl up with, I invite you to come and take a sensuous ride with Hunter, Sloan, Aaron and Clark, the gorgeous and sinfully desirable heroes in the spicy, yet romantic, tales that are featured in AN ALL NIGHT MAN.<br /><br />If you're looking for a hot read for those cold, winter nights, look no further.  Each novella borders on the erotic, without being tasteless and trashy; instead they promote a desire to love and be loved.  Brenda Jackson, Joylynn Jossell, Kayla Perrin and Tamara Sneed have each developed characters and stories that will have you saying \\"oo la la\\" and grabbing a fan or an ice cold glass of water to cool you down.  AN ALL NIGHT MAN is sure to make its readers pull an all-nighter, not only because you're caught up in each story, but also because, well you know...<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Education for all...	In VIRGIE GOES TO SCHOOL WITH US BOYS, a young girl is unable to go to school with her six brothers.  After much begging, she finally convinces her parents that girls should be able to learn also and reassures them that she can travel the seven miles to the school run by the Quakers.  Though one would imagine the journey is rough for a small child, little Virgie keeps up with her brothers and arrives at school with them, ready to learn.<br /><br />While this story is loosely based on the author's grandfather (one of Virgie's brothers), it symbolizes what many blacks must've felt during the Reconstruction period -- the need to use education as a stepping stone towards freedom.  As with a lot of his other books E. B. Lewis uses the watercolor medium for VIRGIE GOES TO SCHOOL WITH US BOYS.  His illustrations perfectly complement the story, bringing the reader into each page, and closer to Virgie and her family.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

What Next?	With AFTER THE LOVING by Gwynne Forster, we are once again thrust into the world that is the Harrington brothers of Eagle Park, Maryland.  In Once In A Lifetime we were introduced to this brooding group of brothers and their sassy cook, Mr. Henry.  This time as the story opens, eldest brother Telford and Alexis, the former house manager, are preparing for their wedding, however AFTER THE LOVING centers on the middle brother Russ and Velma, Alexis' sister.<br /><br />Alexis has arrived in Eagle Park to serve as a witness to her sister's marriage and is once again drawn to Russ.  Russ is the brother who is engrossed in his work as an architect and has never dealt with his ill feelings towards his wayward mother, thus he will not allow anyone, especially a woman, to steal his heart.  However, Velma has managed to get under his skin and when she stays in Eagle Park to keep Tara, Alexis' inquisitive five-year old daughter, Russ guards his heart with an ironclad fist, which makes for a strange courtship between the two.  Once again little Tara is the voice of reason and she is a child who endears herself to those around her.<br /><br />Gwynne Forster has developed a rich storyline of not just romance but other human emotions that make you take stock of what and who is important.  Forster has managed to exhibit Russ' classic middle child tendencies with compassion and empathy. The imagery used of inner city Baltimore and the countryside of Maryland is vivid and arresting.  The dramatics, foresight and understanding the characters bring to the pages can be classified as romance at its best.  This second installment of the Harrington brothers and their significant others is an interesting tale simply because Russ and Velma both have uncomfortable issues and misunderstandings that prevent them from fully committing to their yearnings.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Fasten Your Seat Belts	Flight attendant Nikkola Knight is madly in love with breathtakingly gorgeous, airplane pilot Captain Latham Scott.

When Latham finally admits his feelings for her, she realizes the feeling is mutual, and they begin a whirlwind relationship filled with love and happiness.<br /><br />When Latham receives some devastating news from Carmen Thomas, his ex-lover, upon Nikki's persistence and her vow, their newfound romance is put on the backburner.

Nikki is torn between her love for Latham and her lust for Mychal.  They soon discover that Carmen and Mychal have been plotting the demise of their relationship from its onset.

ABOVE THE CLOUDS captures the reader's attention and does a wonderful job depicting the relationship between Nikki and Latham.  I was so drawn into the storyline I could not put the book down.

A Friend Loveth At All Times	People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. If you think back over your life, I am sure you can recall several or maybe one memorable person who touched your life in a special way. NOTES ON UNCLE AND ME by Willie Wofford Jr., is a personal memoir about the author's life in Phoenix, AZ and a special person he met during his brief time there.<br /><br />Willie Wofford Jr., a recent college graduate, relocated to Phoenix, AZ from Marion, IL, with the hopes of getting a new start in a big city. He met Daniel Jay, an eighty-two year old entrepreneur, affectionately known as \\"Uncle\\", while out and about trying to learn his way around. A very drunk Uncle approached him and asked for directions, and Willie offered to drop him off at his destination. This was the beginning of a friendship like no other. Willie worked at a hotel and Uncle was the owner of a shoeshine stand. After their first encounter, Uncle told Willie where his business was and for him to stop by sometime. Willie began to make stopping by the stand part of his daily routine. From his frequent visits, the two bonded and became the best of friends. Uncle shared funny stories and touching memories of his life, and Willie was an eager audience. They frequented racetracks to bet and had each other's back in any given situation. Their age difference had no barrier on their friendship; these two genuinely cared for one another. Although Willie was in Phoenix for a short seven months the impact Uncle had on his life was a profound one.<br /><br />The concept of NOTES ON UNCLE AND ME was very good; who wouldn't want to pay homage to someone who touched their life in such a profound way? Although the concept was good, there were brief chapters introducing people who really didn't fit or appeared to be misplaced. What I enjoyed most about this book was the relationship between Uncle and Willie, whom Uncle affectionately called Nephew. They talked about any and everything under the sun and I think both of them learned something from the other. The book also made me think back over people who have come into my life for a reason, season or lifetime and who have helped shape me into the person I am today.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Dig Out	You might say Lynnette Khalfani is perfectly qualified to tell people how to get out of debt.  She's been onstage with Dr. Phil and Jane Pauley and numerous others talking to people about spending wisely and managing their debt.  However, what makes her the perfect candidate is that she was over $100,000 in credit card debt herself and dug herself out of it in only three years.  While that fact is very impressive, the valuable step-by-step instructions on how to get out of a financial rut is what makes ZERO DEBT a book you'll really want to have.<br /><br />Khalfani provides her readers with an easy to follow plan to get out of debt.  She starts the lessons by defining debt and how most people find themselves caught up in it. Whatever the reason for the debt, it seems Lynnette Khalfani has a plan for it. From simple requests like opting out of credit card offers to more complex tasks like gathering all your bills and finding out what you owe, ZERO DEBT is well-balanced and simple.<br /><br />ZERO DEBT is written in an easily followed conversational tone, a helpful trait when talking about finances to those who are already stressed when they pick up the book. Lynnette Khalfani breaks it down for the rest of us and I, for one, am grateful she did. I'll be following her steps to get myself on track financially and plan for the bright future ahead.

Seeing the Best In You	In the age of Columbine and rampant bullying, a book encouraging the development of a positive self-image is not only nice to have, but necessary.  Wanda Thomas' HANDSOME ME is just this type of book.  Trevor, a young African-American adolescent, is smart, athletic, handsome and fairly self-confident.  However, when he overhears a group of girls calling him ugly, he begins to feel down about himself.  After returning home, Trevor heads to his bedroom for some serious self-reflection and discovers he has a lot of positive attributes and isn't so bad after all.<br /><br />HANDSOME ME is a noble effort on the part of Ms. Thomas to provide children's literature with positive messages.  The plot serves as a reminder to parents that it doesn't take much to wound a child's delicate self-esteem.  Trevor's way of dealing with his tarnished self-image provides an example for young readers in similar circumstances.  However, the book's happy ending was a little too quick and took away from the overall realism of the story.  In spite of this, HANDSOME ME is a good introduction and starting point from which parents can delve deeper into issues of self-image with their children.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay, Children's Editor<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Looking for a Miracle	IT JUST GETS BETTER WITH TIME by Maseyree depicts the lives of two adult sisters, Dorothy and Caroline who were orphaned at a young age and raised by their aunt. Caroline, secretly jealous of the praise heaped upon Dorothy as child, sets out to live a life of luxury while Dorothy struggles through adulthood with a husband who has spent more time in prison than he has at home.  Added to this grief are four teenage children who Dorothy literally raises alone.  Caroline, married to an executive and the mother of two, always has a word of unsolicited advice for Dorothy while snickering behind her back at what she believes is the mess Dorothy has made of her life.  Unbeknownst to Dorothy, Caroline has skeletons in her closet and Maseyree takes us on a journey through the trials, tribulations and joys of these two very different sisters.<br /><br />The novel boasts a very good storyline filled with thought provoking issues that force you to evaluate what is important to you and what will sustain you.  However, what is needed is good editing.  There are too many grammatical and spelling errors and there is a lack of structure.  Often the story veers off to another subject or highlights another character without the benefit of separation between the paragraphs.<br /><br />With characters that are lovable, adorable, ruthless, spoiled and the list can go on, Maseyree showcases strife, forgiveness and what the power of prayer and faith can accomplish.  IT JUST GETS BETTER WITH TIME would lead to a lively debate among book club members for the subject matters alone.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Threesome	I heard so much about Relentless Aaron and his psychodrama, I just had to try it and see for myself. TRIPLE THREAT is a whirlwind ride through the lives of three very different women who are seemingly connected.  Sissy Dickerson is a New York City police officer assigned to the domestic violence unit and on a daily basis, sees her share of abuse and the mockery that men make of the justice system.  Sissy has abandonment issues - her father left the family when she was five years old.  April Davis is a freelance writer, friend and housemate to Sissy.  She is a very sensitive woman who constantly deals with the abandonment of her father through his death. And finally there is River Burlington.  River is a murderess, killing more than twenty men by very sadistic means; you have to wonder what her story is.<br /><br />As the body count rises, Sissy is drawn into the murders and is on a mission to catch the Pink Heart Murderer although it is out of her jurisdiction.  April, needing a story that will win her some notoriety, tags along for some juicy facts.  All the while River is luring them into her ruthless scheme in an effort to flush out Sissy.<br /><br />The book begins with the introduction of River and immediately you are drawn in.  The characterizations are three-dimensional and the detective in you will beg for you to continue reading for the conclusion.  A conclusion that is plausible but shocking at best. A conclusion that will have you shaking your head and asking yourself why you didn't figure it out sooner.  Relentless Aaron does a good job with the description of the settings in the Bronx; the drama, sex and murders are wild and wacky.  However, what this story needs is major editing.  Misspelled words and incorrect punctuations are rampant.  With those corrections, I would say that Relentless Aaron has an exciting story on his hands.  This is definitely not for the queasy and faint at heart.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersZ Reviewers <br />	2005-01-23
The "C" Word	What makes a man or woman unable to commit in a relationship? Could the person they are dating not be the \\"one\\" for them? Did they have a traumatic experience in their past and are incapable of fully trusting another? Some people have no desire to commit, while others lead their significant other on, allowing them to think they do. EVERY WOMAN'S MAN by Rique Johnson deals with a man incapable of commitment.<br /><br />Devin Alexander is every woman's dream man. He is considerate, sensitive, charming, romantic and attentive, not to mention fine as wine. Any woman would be happy to have Devin by her side. There is only one problem - due to a painful incident that happened in his past, Devin vowed never to commit or utter those three words women love to hear. What could possibly happen to make a man NEVER want to commit again?<br /><br />Devin engages in three different relationships during different times of his life with three beautiful, smart and caring women. Each of them are determined to get the two things out of Devin that he refuses to give: his love and a commitment. But the demon that has a hold of Devin's heart refuses to let go. Will any of these ladies succeed in freeing Devin's heart and mind enabling him to trust enough to make a lifetime commitment?<br /><br />EVERY WOMAN'S MAN is a sensual, steamy page turner that you will not want to put down. With so many men incapable of commitment, this novel gives us a little insight on what goes on in a man's heart and mind. We see that men hurt just like women and sometimes the hurt is a little deeper than the mind can even imagine. What I enjoyed most was reading about such a caring and romantic man who wanted to, but was unable to do the right thing. The story was well-written and you could easily relate to its strong characters. With just a touch of humor and wit and sex scenes that are sure to turn the heat up a notch, EVERY WOMAN'S MAN is a book that will get your fires burning and juices stirring.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Give A Hoot	When I first saw the title HOOTERVILLE by Judy Stewart, I thought there is no way I want to read a book about breasts.  How could someone possibly write a whole book about breasts? Although the book is indeed about breasts, it details the importance of women getting yearly mammograms.<br /><br />Hooterville is a city made up of all women. No men or children reside in Hooterville. All of the residents of Hooterville work various jobs and have everything they need except a medical facility. So once a year they take a trip to Probesville where they are poked and prodded to make sure they have a clean bill of health. Everyone willingly goes to Probesville except Skeptical Kay. She doesn't see the need to get poked and prodded and just flat out refuses to get her yearly check up. That is until one day something happens to her hooters and she doesn't know what to do. She tries to ignore it and hopes it goes away but the problem gets worse and she reluctantly makes the trip to Probesville. Once she realizes that a check up wasn't as bad as she thought, she was happy she ended up going.<br /><br />HOOTERVILLE is a light-hearted and humorous quick read. It relays a serious message and is told in a lyrical format. The book details the importance of mammograms and how something that a lot of women fear or put off, really isn't that big of a deal and could end up saving their life. What I enjoyed most was the humorous way the importance of having a mammogram was displayed. What I didn't like about the book was although the subject matter was serious, it was written almost as if it were a children's book. Life is too short and is precious and we should strive to do all we can to ensure our bodies are healthy, which in turn will enable us to live longer lives.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Love at first bite	Officer Jessie McQuade is on the trail of a wolf that bit a good Samaritan. She doesn't find the wolf, but does stumble onto an incredibly handsome, stark naked man. Playing off her attraction for the man isn't the easiest, but she makes it back to her precinct with her dignity in tact.<br /><br />The next day the woman who was bitten by the wolf attacks and kills the principal of the school where she works. She is about to murder one of her students when Jessie and the chief of police intervene. More incidents happen, and after investigation, Jessie determines that the bitten victims begin to drastically change within twenty-four hours. The change is caused by one of three things, each one more bizarre than the next: there is a super-strain of rabies that creates mutant wolves, one of Hitler's scientists' experiments has come to bite the world some fifty-some odd years later, or the Indian legend about the werewolf god is real.<br /><br />Jessie finds a totem at the scene where the first victim was bitten. She's told that a professor at the local college is an expert on totems and Indian rituals. She heads over to speak with him and is stunned to find out that Professor Will Cadotte is non-other than the incredibly handsome, stark naked man who sent her heart to racing. He agrees to help her, while he pursues her. She doesn't trust easily. And though everything in her heart is telling her Cadotte is the man for her, the evidence points to him being a werewolf.<br /><br />Lori Handeland has woven a sensual, suspenseful tale that kept me intrigued throughout. At times, BLUE MOON had me laughing; other times, I was trying to solve the mystery; still other times, I was in need of a cold shower. The cast of characters Handeland created were a good mixture of everything from maturity's patient wisdom to youth's vibrant enthusiasm. BLUE MOON is a winner, and I look forward to Lori Handeland's future work.

Following a Dream...	Anyone familiar with the internet has probably heard of Heather Covington and her mass marketing promotion of authors, poets, and artists.  In addition to her drive and commitment towards establishing herself as not only an author, but also a publisher, magazine editor, event promoter and more, she shares many of her experiences in her latest piece of work, THE DISILGOLD WAY: Countdown 101 from Writer to Self-Publisher.  Beginning with a poem on how to publish one's own work, she begins her story of how she went from just a writer to a self-published one by following various steps, guidelines, and reference points.<br /><br />Serving also as a tool for promoting the Disilgold Literary Network Association (DLNA) Members, THE DISILGOLD WAY covers areas of writing, publishing, and promoting, and is one way the author strives to give back to those who have helped her along the way.  Ms. Covington includes checklists for writers, pros and cons of Print-On-Demand publishing, marketing suggestions, and a myriad of other items of interest to the writer thinking of self-publishing their work.  She also offers advice and tips on taking care of yourself, becoming more organized, and my favorite, the five principles of success formula:  integrity, quality, professionalism, service, and dedication to your mission statement.  Another part I enjoyed from this book is Covington's focus on inspiring and motivating, not only others, but also yourself as you're writing the book.  In whole, it is a hodge-podge of information helpful to those who need not only guidelines, but also examples of the stepping-stones needed in the publishing world.<br /><br />While this book is quite informational, it's also a bit bulky in content and some of the content would work better as appendices instead of being included in the actual text.  Information such as bios on various authors and literary enthusiasts is a great resource to have, but it seemed to be out of place, and slowed down the main focus of the book.  I would love to see a lot of the examples and checklists pulled out of the book and an accompanying workbook developed to house this information.  Additionally, THE DISILGOLD WAY is a bit repetitive in several chapters and could use quite a bit more editing to trim out the fat, correct grammatical and other typographical errors.<br /><br />In spite of the aforementioned things, this book is a true testament of the author's dedication towards her dream of writing.  It is not only motivational for the unpublished writer who would like to become successful, but is also inspiring as we read of Ms. Covington's success and desire to support others in the industry.  It always interests me to see someone take their passion and thrive from it, but to give back to others and share what you have already learned is also to be commended.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines from the book, \\"To have longevity as a self-publisher requires patience, and an internal need to be right with Self.\\"  I enjoyed this and hope other authors, aspiring and already successful will take this tidbit of information and mold their creative influences around it.

The Burden of Being	The troubles and turmoil of life often present us with guiding burdens, mountains that not only seem but are truly impossible to climb, and boundaries put in place to check even the strongest of wills. These mountains, boulders, and impassable rivers serve as a standard, a ceiling and a foundation; created by the society in which we take our very breath.  So when we find ourselves stuck in the very system that we create, who can we blame? Who can we turn to for rescuing? These are the very questions that narrator Tambudzai learns to ask in Tsitsi Dangarembga's novel NERVOUS CONDITIONS.<br /><br />Throughout her young adult life, Tambudzai witnesses many cultural tendencies of her people and struggles internally with what she is being taught versus what she observes and believes to be right.  Aside from her Rhodesian homeland being colonized by the British, she also wrestles with getting an education in a country where an education is seen as wasted on women.  The role of men over women in this very patriarchal society serves as the backbone of NERVOUS CONDITIONS and operates as a means to compare different women's struggle to survive  that cast-iron system. Through Tambudzai's eyes, readers see how her cousin Nyasha rebels against her father - the family leader, proclaimed prince, and headmaster of the school at the Mission. Readers see the difference between Tambudzai's subservient mother and her mother's defiant sister. We also see how this society treats a woman just as educated as her husband. Following Tambudzai as she progresses towards higher learning and gains a deeper understanding of the world that surrounds her, literary audiences discover just how suffocating it is to deal with the burdens of simply surviving.<br /><br />Many themes course through NERVOUS CONDITIONS making it an excellent novel for discussion and evaluation.  Aside from the obvious men/women theme, a few other issues in the novel are the dangers and benefits of colonization, the necessity of education, and Christianity vs. traditional African religions.  I also liked the importance of food and the role it played throughout the novel, especially at the end with Nyasha's rebellion. Exceptionally written, Dangarembga's novel, although about the learning period during a young teenager's life, is not child's play.  This is a very adult novel filled with mature situations and intellectual food for meditation.  The characters are well developed and the author takes time to draw scenes for her audience.  You can see the poverty when she shows it to you just as well as you can see the surplus when it exists.

Emotional Rollercoaster	Trials and tribulations are a part of everyday life. The average person would probably rather do without the burdens; however, by not having these experiences their life would remain stagnant and not grow. Trials are intended to strengthen you and equip you with peace and patience. OPEN HEART by Avis Johnson is a tale revolving around life's ups and downs.<br /><br />Family secrets, relationship issues and other daily instances can be found in this novel. We meet two couples who are having marital problems and are connected in more ways than one. There is also a secret divulged which could tear a family apart. Will they be able to overcome this secret that has indirectly affected them their entire lives? How can a woman who has been in and out of endless romances find and keep that special someone? Can a married couple overcome infidelity? These questions and more are entertained throughout the pages of OPEN HEART, where everyday occurrences affect everyday lives.<br /><br />Although the idea of depicting the ups, downs, joys and concerns of everyday life is a good concept, the book could have been written in a way that was easier to understand. It jumped back and forth from first to third person and jumped around from scenario to scenario. I found myself wondering who I was reading about, and thinking, \\"what happened to this person or that person?\\" In several instances, I couldn't figure out who was speaking.

What they don't know is their lives were destined to cross.  For fans of Ms. Banks' Vampire Huntress series, this is a prequel to one of the guardian's stories.<br /><br />Finally, Lori Handeland's Red Moon Rising, is a welcome reprieve to the previous dark stories, where comedy is used to break up some of the dark moments of this tale based on the ancient beliefs of the Indians.  The female character is a writer who is facing writer's block, but is also being stalked by a skinwalker in wolf's clothing.  Skinwalkers or shapeshifters can change their appearance by putting on skins of others and in this case a wolf.  The wolf needs the heroine, but her male protector plans not only to fight this adversary but also fight his strong romantic feelings for the heroine.<br /><br />All the stories combine the elements of ordinary people facing extraordinary circumstances who find passion and romance in spite of the predicament they discover themselves in.  Although the stories are short in nature, the romance elements are very much intact, in fact there are a few steamy love scenes that will make you blush.  However, I am not sure what I was expecting from this compilation, but I felt a bit let down after I completed the novel.  The paranormal portions of the stories were great, but the romances in a couple of the stories just seemed out of place.  The happily ever after premise found in romance stories are hard to fathom in stories where you meet under life or death situations and in a day or two you are in love.  Since these are short stories, the characters are not as developed as I would have liked them to be and as a reader I needed more depth in the plot, since this is not a typical romance novel.  Readers who enjoy genres where the mythical and mystical can be real and romance is the key to survival will enjoy this compilation.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerspilation, but I felt a bit let down after I completed the novel.

A message for all women	T.D. Jakes has gone directly to the soul of women in WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED!<br /><br />In what can only be described as a spiritual love sonnet to women, Jakes<br /><br />speaks to all of the hurt and pain that has been experienced by women since<br /><br />the beginning of time.  Using taut Biblical examples like Sara, Eve, and<br /><br />Esther, Jakes ministers to women in a way that convinces you that divine<br /><br />intervention was in play when he penned these words.<br /><br />WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED! delves into women's roles as ordained by God and how<br /><br />often these roles have become confused due to old hurts, pain, and abuse.  As<br /><br />Jakes covers a plethora of issues including incest, premarital sex, rape, and<br /><br />promiscuity, he speaks directly to the reader.  You often feel you are sitting<br /><br />in the room with him as he discusses these topics and the biblical insight<br /><br />into his views.  He prays with you as you read and he encourages every woman<br /><br />to reach for her individual greatness in God.<br /><br />I have read this book twice and both times I was in very different places in<br /><br />my life.  Each reading brought me a very different and personal message.<br /><br />Jakes describes the stages of life within the text and I found myself easily<br /><br />in his metaphor.  I was so moved by his words that I dismissed my reading of<br /><br />the book for a second time as coincidence and acknowledged it as the \\"God-<br /><br />incidence\\" that it certainly was.<br /><br />WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED! is a book that should be on every woman's nightstand<br /><br />because no matter what you are experiencing, Jakes has a message for you time<br /><br />and time again.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
History Retold...	UNDER THE QUILT OF NIGHT, written by Deborah Hopkinson, is a wonderful story of the journeys taken by slaves long ago on their path to freedom.  A runaway girl flees with other slaves during the darkness of night, waiting, listening, and looking for the opportunity to continue fleeing toward safety.  When she spots a quilt hanging outside a house, she knows she's found a safe house in which she will be fed and sheltered.  At the end of their travels, they meet freedom.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story capturing events I'm sure happened many nights during the times of slavery.  The writing flows fluidly and is set up in several poem-like passages throughout the book.  The illustrations are wonderful, clearly showing the darkness of the night, the emotions of the characters, as well as the symbolic nature of their plight.  This is a book I'd highly recommend to parents, teachers, and librarians for older children as everyone should study and know about The Underground Railroad.<br /><br />Children at the lower end of the projected age range may not enjoy the book as much if reading alone because the colors are more somber than most kids' books.  However, if read with an adult or coupled with lessons on the Underground Railroad, it may be more enjoyable to them.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A long time coming...	As a child growing up on her family's vineyard in the Sonoma Valley, Erica Bryant experienced her first blush of young love.  Erica was so infatuated with Joshua Knight, a migrant worker who was several years her senior, that she became his shadow.  Even though Joshua did not do anything to encourage her, Erica found herself hoping against hope that he would one day return her feelings.  Much to Erica's dismay, the romance was not to be.  When her family's harvest was over, Joshua and his family moved on to the next job.<br /><br />Years later, Erica runs into Joshua at a winery in Paris.  He has changed so much over the years that she doesn't recognize him, but Joshua knows who she is.  After a brief game of \\"guess who\\", Erica remembers Joshua.  Realizing that her feelings for Joshua did not diminish with the passage of time, Erica sets out on a mission to claim the only man she has ever loved.<br /><br />In WAITING FOR YOU, Janice Sims' latest release, she takes us deep into the heart of wine country, both here and abroad.  Her vivid description of the land, and her knowledge of the winemaking industry were so impressive, it was as if she was born into a family of vintners.  Unfortunately, the story seemed to focus more on the ins and out of the industry, which overshadowed the romance between the couple.  Not only did I want to get to know the couple more, being a hopeless romantic, I also wanted to experience the full gamut of emotions between Erica and Joshua as they re-discovered their love for each other.  Hopefully Sims' next novel will bring back that fire and desire that her previous works are known for.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Her Many Faces	KILLER CHAMELEON is the latest installment of the popular series involving the crime-fighting sleuth, Leigh Ann Warren.  She's back to solve the whodunit that is affecting her life.  Leigh is a former D.C. cop who, after two postponements, is trying to get married.  She does not want any more drama to erupt in her life and to keep her from marrying the man she loves.<br /><br />Someone has cancelled Leigh's honeymoon reservations.  Whoever she is looks like her, talks like her, definitely has it in for her and is intent on ruining any form of Leigh's happiness.  The chameleon is so adept in changing her appearance that discovering her identity is a true mystery.  When the chameleon harms someone close to Leigh, she is determined that she will solve this whodunit sooner rather than later.<br /><br />KILLER CHAMELEON will take readers on a ride as they try to guess the identity of the chameleon.  The mystery will keep you reading, however, if you are unfamiliar with the previous Leigh Warren mysteries you will be at a slight disadvantage.  There is only a minimal amount of background given and mostly from the recent mystery solved.  Although most of the characters were developed in previous stories, their characterizations are sufficient for the enjoyment of this book.  The pace was not as swift as I would have liked, but the premise was enjoyable.  Personally, I will read the previous stories in this series so I can better grasp our crime fighting sleuth and I would also encourage others to read them as well.  Chassie West has, without a doubt, an interesting series that is sure to gain a large following.

One man's journey	In THE TORCH CARRIER, Antonio Richardson retells his journey from discovering his true love to learning to live again once his true love passed.  In this poetic saga, a teenaged Antonio struggle as he comes to terms with falling in love. We witness the subsequent marriage and the birth of his children, and we mourn as he loses his wife.<br /><br />Antonio places the reader there as he recounts how he dealt with his wife's prolonged battle with cancer. The reader is there as he begins life as a single father of three school aged children. Readers feel his fear, anxiety, and guilt as time moves on, and he finds his soul mate. We see him wrestle with his emotions until he accepts his wife's death and realizes that she wanted him to truly live life.<br /><br />Antonio Richardson has a poetic voice that flows smoothly and allows the reader to feel his prose. There are areas that could have used a strong editorial hand to help Antonio dig deeper. For example, how he helped his children cope during their mother's battle with cancer and examples of unexpected changes/obstacles when he became a single father and how he overcame them. All in all, THE TORCH CARRIER is a truly inspirational story that sheds light on a difficult, often times dark, journey.

A dangerous game...	Good guy or bad guy?  Stability and safety or danger at every turn?  You would think the choice would be easy, right?  Natalia Foles, a seemingly level-headed young woman, finds herself in this quandry when Shawn Wilson, a thugged out bad boy, enters her life.  Will she give in to the extreme lust she feels for Shawn, or will she stay with her current boyfriend Mark Delucchio, who loves her, but doesn't set off any sparks in the bedroom?  Unsure of which road to take, she decides to play both sides of the coin, essentially wanting to have her cake and eat it too.  Before she knows it, Natalia's life becomes a maelstorm of murder and mayhem.  How it turns out is anybody's guess.<br /><br />With all of the madness found within the pages of this book, TRIANGLE OF SINS would be better described as \\"Octagon of Sins\\" or some other multi-sided object.  There was just enough action to keep the book flowing, but the majority of the plot was so unbelievable that I often found myself shaking my head, wondering what sane person would make such irresponsible choices.  I also found myself needing an ebonic/hip-hop/urban dictionary just to understand the majority of the conversation between the characters.  The overwhelming usage of the \\"street\\" language made this a chore to read for me, and coupled with the outrageous scenarios, I was glad when the book came to an end.  Even though I didn't care for this novel, I'm sure fans of the urban genre will enjoy this tangled web of mystery and deceit that ends so abruptly, a sequel is sure to follow.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Always there...	Children growing up in the church are taught that angels are watching over them and their well-being.  Author Toni Calmeyn takes this one step further in her children's book ALLIE THE ANGEL.  She shows the many ways in which angels are sent down to help not only children, but adults in their day-to-day living.  Sharing love, fixing problems, healing hurts, and being there are shown through the illustrations of this book.<br /><br />Written in rhymes which are easy to follow, this book is surely to be a favorite  with young  kids.  The lessons and depiction of angels always being there will appeal to parents who are nurturing their children and raising them in the beliefs of heaven and angels.  It was also a nice touch to see Allie as a young girl  versus the standard white dress, wings, and halo.  This characterization allows children to come to terms more readily with the concept amd that angels can be human too.  My only request would be to see Allie depicted in all races in this series of children's books and not just the Caucasion Allie.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book with my daughter and she enjoyed repeating the words and using the pictures to come up with her own story for the book.  ALLIE THE ANGEL is a wonderful book for teaching children about angels and their place in our lives.  It clearly shows that someone is always there, watching over us.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A christians ultimate goal is to live their life according to God's will and to spend eternity in Heaven; however, the average person has no idea what their purpose here on earth is. PASSION FOR YOUR KINGDOM PURPOSE by Dr. Sir Walter Mack Jr., takes you on a journey to discover what God has called you to do. The book is divided in three parts: Kingdom Passion of the Church, Kingdom Passion of a Man and Kingdom Passion of a Woman. By reading , studying and meditating on these sections we will develop a passion to fulfill God's will and know your purpose.<br /><br />Kingdom Passion of the Church focuses on finding what God needs and being ready and available to fulfill those needs. God needs us to do His will but to also have a passion for it. The average person has a passion for something, whether it be reading, sports, music or children, there is something out there that you just LOVE doing. What God wants is for us to use that passion to upbuild his kingdom. For example, if you love reading, use that love to teach others to read, by doing this you are doing something you enjoy and also helping someone in need, which in essence is sharing God's love. If you have a passion for children and seeing them succeed, become a mentor and be a good Christian role model for a child in need. Whatever your passion is use it to upbuild God's kingdom by showing brotherly love.<br /><br /> The Kingdom Passion for a Man and The Kingdom Passion for a Woman, delves specifically into what Christian men and women need to do to discover their purpose. God wants His children to have peace and joy. Things that are not done according to God's will causes stress and depression. Both men and women should not be afraid to pray, converse with God, get to know Him intimately and spread His word to nonbelievers.<br /><br />This book details ways to overcome whatever obstacles, trials or tribulations that may come your way. By trusting in God's word, being obedient and doing things according to His will, you can rest assured that peace and joy will come.

Faith	The title, IMANI ALL MINE, is a play on words for it represents not only the love and possessiveness that Tasha, the narrator of the story, feels for her daughter Imani, but also her quest for faith to endure adversity.  Tasha is a young African-American high school student and single mother.  She lives with her often emotionally detached mother, who is also a single parent, in a community plagued by violence and poverty.  In spite of her environment, and the challenges involved with trying to complete high school while taking care of her daughter, Tasha perseveres but just can't seem to catch a break.  The book reads more like a series of diary entries, but as the story evolves I quickly found myself engrossed in Tasha's day-to-day happenings.  I was privy to her innermost thoughts, her joys and her sorrows, and as the plot builds, I was more and more connected to her.  When the story reaches its dramatic climax, I had experienced a full range of emotions.<br /><br />Connie Porter has penned a gripping, heart-wrenching novel that is full of slap-you-in-the-face realism.  Through Tasha, readers experience first hand, urban violence, sexual violations, failing educational systems, teenaged parenthood, the need to feel loved and so much more.  I found myself feeling emotions along with Tasha and I quickly realized that in spite of all her difficulties, it was Tasha's faith and love for her daughter that sustained her.  This book may be a little too raw for younger readers, but it is filled with important lessons that a more mature young adult reader needs to hear.  It may take a couple of chapters for readers to adjust to Porter's use of ebonic dialect, but as the story progresses this lends further credibility to the realism of the plot. This is a book I not only recommend for young adults, but also to educators, parents and anyone interested in America's urban youth.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay, Children's Editor<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Desires of the Heart	Is there such a thing as happily ever after? I believe there is, but not, of course, without enduring a few trials and tribulations. Some people's vision of a happy life is having a spouse, two kids and a house with a picket fence. Other's may measure their happiness by their career success or their wealth. STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF LOVE by Nina Corbett takes us on a journey with two best friends who are in search of their happily ever after.<br /><br />Ashley Taylor has a very demanding television career. She has been very successful in business, but unsuccessful in love. She has virtually given up on finding true love, but not her ultimate dream of having a baby. Deciding to become a mother without the use of a man, Ashley consults a sperm bank with the hopes of using invitro- fertilization to make her dream of motherhood come true. Ashley's meddling mother is pressuring her to get out and date and meet someone. She constantly tells her she isn't getting any younger. Unaware of Ashley's plans to become impregnated by a sperm bank, she sets Ashley up with Kevin Hughes. Dating and meeting someone is last on Ashley's list of priorities until she actually meets Kevin and finds herself falling for him. Will Ashley continue on with her plans of using invitro-fertilization to become a mother? Or, will Kevin be the one who can change her views on men and dating?<br /><br />Maya, like Ashley, also has a demanding television career, but unlike Ashley, she is in a relationship. Maya and David have been together for eight years and the relationship is as dead  as it can get. They never go out or do anything exciting. A typical date night consists of renting movies. Not only is the relationship boring, but David is controlling and possessive. On several occasions, Maya has tried to end the relationship with David, yet they always end up back together. David refuses to let Maya go and their relationship is filled with lies and deceit. After Maya endures a tragic family emergency, David does the unthinkable with the hopes of him and Maya living happily ever after.  However, Maya isn't too thrilled with David's surprise and thinks this just may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Can Maya and David work through their issues and have a love that stands the test of time? Or has Maya finally had it and is now ready to begin a new chapter in her life?<br /><br />Corbett's debut novel is undeniably a must have for the avid reader. Sharp writing, recognizable characters and real life situations are what make STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF LOVE a good read. The friendship between Ashley and Maya is what some women only dream of having. They are true sister friends who are there for one another no matter what. Their situations are not uncommon, and they feel as long as they have each other, they can weather the storm. The bond they share is one of the things I enjoyed most about the book. So often you see women being catty and negative toward one another; it was a breath of fresh air reading about two positive motivating women sharing the bond of friendship. I also liked the fact that their situations are ones that everyone can relate to, nothing out of the ordinary or unbelievable.

A dream gone bad	For Michael Banner, a.k.a. Spits, growing up in the Bronx was a battle every day to survive.  He and his friends had dreams of making it big in the Bronx.  Spits watched his mother work herself into the ground to take care of the family and didn't want it to happen to him.  He and his crew wanted the money, or \\"paper\\" as they called it, and lots of it.  They wanted the best cars, the nicest cribs, the designer clothes and the power of notoriety and respect on the streets.  It all started with a dream of building an enterprise that was only supposed to be a summer gig.  After the plan was executed, the enterprise would earn \\"paper\\" into the thousands by summer's end and millions within a year.<br /><br />Spits had book smarts and good business sense.  He put it all to use after his second year of high school, with the intention to have just a summer job.  The plan was simple; he offered all of his close friends an opportunity to become investors in a business enterprise at $500 a piece.  They all agreed that the returns would be reinvested into the company and only a small portion of the proceeds would go to each investor.  The product they invested in, of course, was drugs.  Spits and his crew became the Time Bombs-one of the most feared and revered gangs in the Bronx.  Their success on the streets was virtually overnight and the greed fueled their ability to set up avenues in Florida and California with the FBI closely monitoring their rise to dominance and the blood baths that ensued. Would the FBI turn their dream into a nightmare?<br /><br />CRACKED DREAMS is the freshman offering of Michael Baptiste, a new author who catapulted onto the street fiction scene.  His writing is engaging and does draw the reader in.  I liked the fact that Baptiste took the time to develop the main characters in this book.  I was able to understand the thought behind the decisions, even if I didn't agree.  The journey into the Bronx underworld with the Time Bombs was one that involved plenty of treachery, violence, sex, drugs and money, but I would have liked to have the secondary story involving the FBI developed a little more as the main story progressed.  We were only treated to what I believed was a precursory glance into their operations.  Despite the fact that I was also able to guess the outcome early on, this was an interesting experience.

Make Your Dreams A Reality	Imagine this- You are in your teen years and having the time of your life: skipping school, getting drunk and high, and having sex with any and everyone without regard to the effects of having unprotected sex. You are in a gang and have the whole world at your feet. Then the impossible happens, you are diagnosed with HIV.  Life as you know it changes for the worst, and your world comes tumbling down. How could this happen to you? Although you are living the street life now, you have big dreams of becoming famous. But none of that seems possible with your diagnosis. You feel as if your life is over, or is it?  What will your classmates think? How can you face your friends and family? What are you going to do? I'LL CRY TOMORROW by Pamela M. Johnson is a novel dealing with the above situation.<br /><br />Chyna Azzino-Milano, who was diagnosed 10 years ago as being HIV-positive,is now a world famous supermodel and has her own clothing line. She has a net worth of  $550 million dollars and was featured in Forbes magazine as one of the top ten richest African-Americans in the world.  She is married and living a lavish lifestyle. Young girls look up to Chyna, and she is the epitome of what a role model should be. She has her head on straight, is very successful and can have any and every thing her heart desires. She has come a long way from living in the projects and leading a life of crime. Chyna has kept her illness from the public, as she feels it's private and really not anyone's concern but her husband's and a few select close friends. Chyna's condition is leaked to a tabloid, and she is faced with deciding if she should deny the allegations or come clean and finally let the world in on her secret. Will her fans still love her? Or will they condemn her due to sins of the past? More importantly, who would leak this information and betray Chyna's trust? And what was their motive?<br /><br />I'll CRY TOMMORROW is a touching novel that deals with shame, regret and fear. As Chyna is in turmoil over whether to go public with her illness, her faith in God is what gets her through. The word of God keeps her grounded and turns her strife into courage. What I enjoyed most about the book was the development of the characters. Chyna was once an around the way girl who made it big. She didn't let her humble beginnings or her illness deter her from making her dreams come true. If you have any self-doubt and think there is no way your dreams can become a reality, take a look into the life of Chyna Azzino-Milano, and her tenacity and determination will inspire you to reach for the stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Cooking up some good stories	Whether you're looking for a collection of colorful short stories flavored with recipes or an array of creative recipes tossed with life stories, pick up GRACE THE TABLE by Alexander Smalls.  Sharing personal and family intimacies along with familiar and foreign dishes, Smalls introduces us to his world and lovingly guides us to and through all it offered him.  From South Carolina to Germany, readers follow Smalls as he follows his singing passion and steadily amasses dishes and culinary techniques to tempt and satisfy even the ficklest of taste buds.<br /><br />Serving as an autobiography and a cookbook, GRACE THE TABLE is just as educational as it is entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed how Smalls began by centering the chapters on featured dishes and who he saw preparing them. He has written some quite enjoyable stories based on those people, delving into their lives and their role in his life.  Each chapter could stand alone as a short story, a story stocked with mouthwatering descriptions that will make you want to run down to the kitchen and whip up the dish just to see what all the fuss is about. I did try out a few of the recipes.  Mmmm mmmm! There are some crazy dishes in here, like a few of the low country recipes in chapter 5 where Aunt Daisy stirs up some surprises with fish heads and rabbits. Yet, however unusual the dish, the recipes are clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />Reading this book was difficult at times because the passionate way Smalls describes food just kidnaps your senses and transplants you to where he is, be it Sparkle City or Paris. Aside from being a successful chef and an excellent opera singer, Smalls also proves to be a fantastic storyteller.  His writing style is easy, flowing in a manner that politely demands your attention while convincing you that what he has to say is worth listening to. And it is.

All in the family...	Former D.C. cop Leigh Ann Warren barely had time to re-coop from the disappearance of her fianc&eacute; when another deadly mystery called. Leigh Ann receives a call from a man claiming he has kidnapped her beloved foster mother. He says that if Leigh Ann does not get back the Vietnam metal that her father stole from him, he will kill her foster mother. Leigh Ann would love nothing more than to give the man what he wants, but her parents died when she was only five, and she doesn't remember anything about them, not even how they looked.<br /><br />Leigh Ann goes to the FBI, but they don't believe her. The kidnapper has made it look like her foster mother is still traveling the country on her honeymoon. Now Leigh Ann has one week to find the family that didn't come to claim her when her parents died. In finding her family, she also uncovers family secrets that may lead to her murder before she can save her foster mother.<br /><br />KILLER RICHES is a perfect installment in the Leigh Ann Warren mystery series. Watching as Leigh Ann uncovered repressed memories and untangled the web of deceit surrounding her biological family kept me turning the pages. What I like most about Ms. West's books are her characterizations. If you can write a novel with memorable characters, the battle is almost won. I can honestly say that I couldn't stand some of the characters, loved others and felt sorry for others.

A story of strength	\\"The truth is I knew I was female before I knew I was black.\\"  After reading<br /><br />the first line of the preface in Carole Ione's book PRIDE OF FAMILY, I was<br /><br />filled with anticipation of what was to follow.  I was not disappointed<br /><br />because what I discovered was a wonderful account of Ione's family history and<br /><br />her own told in a voice of someone who was seeking answers and understanding.<br /><br />Ione's tone and writing is so inviting that you willingly take the journey with<br /><br />her and you soon find yourself living with the ghosts of her foremothers and<br /><br />their colorful stories.<br /><br />In PRIDE OF FAMILY, Ione embarks on a journey inspired by the mystery of the<br /><br />lives of the three women who raised her -- her mother, her grandmother, and<br /><br />her great aunt.  Each woman was radically different in her view on life, but<br /><br />they were bound together by a family history that was steeped in pride and<br /><br />passion.  Her mother, Leighla Frances Whipper Lewis, was a journalist and<br /><br />mystery writer who also acted.  Her grandmother, Virginia Wheeler, was dancer<br /><br />who loved to gamble and was also no stranger to cooking and cleaning.  Her<br /><br />great aunt, Dr. Ionia Rollin Whipper, was a conservative medical doctor in<br /><br />Washington DC.  Each woman lived life fully and with zest according to her own<br /><br />rules and each taught little Carole a different set of rules which sometimes<br /><br />confused but in the end pushed her to delve into her family's history.<br /><br />PRIDE OF FAMILY exposes the vulnerability of this family of largely<br /><br />accomplished women.  Ione also tells the story of the men who seemed to dance<br /><br />intricately in and out of each woman's story.  Ione's own story is told<br /><br />through telling about her foremothers and her desire to learn more about her<br /><br />great grandmother, Frances Anne Rollin.  PRIDE OF FAMILY is thoroughly<br /><br />engrossing as well as informative.  Ione brings to life the various time<br /><br />periods and locations as she shares the accounts and experiences of her<br /><br />relatives. She discovers her personal truths and she shares them willingly<br /><br />with readers.<br /><br />PRIDE OF FAMILY is a must read for history buffs and anyone with an interest<br /><br />in gender studies.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerseriods and locations as she shares the accounts and experiences of her <br />relatives.

Until The End Of Time	As I was reading UPSTATE by Kalisha Buckhanon song lyrics by Prince came to mind. \\"Until the end of time, I'll be there for you, you own my heart and mind, I truly adore you. If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see. Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me.\\" Have you ever felt that way about someone? Love is a powerful thing and when you are young and in love you feel invincible. Your life revolves around the other person and vice versa. But what happens when tragedy strikes and you and your mate are torn apart? Although you feel your life is over, it must go on, and without your loved one.<br /><br />Natasha and Antonio are teens in love and all of their free time is spent together. They have big plans for the future, and can't wait to make their dreams come true, as soon as they graduate from high school. But just before their senior year, Antonio is sent away for an indefinite period of time. Nastasha vows to stand by her man no matter how long it takes for him to return. Their love is put to the test during their separation and we see if love can conquer all.<br /><br /> Written over the course of a 10 year span, in the form of a series of letters, UPSTATE grasps Antonio and Natasha's resentment, anger and faith as they vow to be true to one another during their ordeal. Brilliantly written, UPSTATE truly touched my heart. The intense love Antonio and Natasha shared some will never find in their lifetime. It was so eloquently displayed it took me back to the time when my husband and I first met. Buckhanon's debut novel is well worth adding to your personal library.

Colorless Love	Taylor James, a biracial beauty, was tortured and harassed due to her mixed heritage. Having a black father and white mother didn't make life easy for Taylor especially growing up in the heart of Detroit. Julian DuPont, who was also biracial, was Taylor's closest friend and protector. If anyone even thought of trying to bully Taylor, they had to go through Julian. Not only were Taylor and Julian close childhood friends they also became each other's first love. They were inseparable and just knew they would spend the rest of their lives together. However, their relationship ended unexpectedly, and Taylor was devastated.<br /><br />After the relationship ended, Taylor threw herself into her work and became a very successful news reporter. She made herself known by going undercover and exposing a violent white supremacist group. Not only did she become well-known, but she also initiated a death threat on her life, the supremacists got out of jail and wanted revenge. They were dead set on getting back at Taylor since she was the one who exposed them and assisted in having them incarcerated.<br /><br />Stress is high in Taylor's life as there is not only a death threat on her life, but work is becoming a burden and she is having second thoughts about her engagement to her boss, the owner of Wolf Television Network. And the final blow is the return of her first love Julian DuPont. Will Julian's reappearance cause added turmoil with Taylor and her fiance'? Will Julian be able to act as Taylor's protector against the white supremacist group as he did in the past?<br /><br />WHITE CHOCOLATE is a well-written pageturner that will keep you wanting more. The writing was so intense I felt as if I was right there with Taylor during her trials. I feared for her life as if she were a close friend. Julian and Taylor's love was so deep and strong it seems trivial why they broke up in the first place. What I enjoyed most was the realism of the storyline. Racism is alive and well even today and Bowman portrayed it pretty much true to form. The only thing I didn't like about the story was Taylor's fiance', he was a character you love to hate. That just goes to show you how well-written this book was, when you find yourself having a strong dislike for a character or two and still enjoying the story. Bowman is a talented author who has a knack for writing suspenseful thrillers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Unconditional...	Abigail Swanson is a woman who knows her mind and her heart.  She has accepted<br />that love and marriage is not for her and that outside of God, the only thing<br />that she can truly believe in is her talent as an interior designer.  But she<br />soon finds herself in a quandary when all she thinks she knows is turned<br />upside down and her life existence is questioned.<br /><br />UNCONDITIONAL by A.C. Arthur takes a look into the life of a very ordinary<br />woman who like many women has made what she believes are lasting life<br />decisions.  Her decisions are quickly cast aside when she meets the handsome<br />Mason Penny, a doctor from an affluent and rival family in her community.<br />Abigail did not plan on falling in love and she didn't plan on wanting to<br />settle down.

Readers ride<br />the roller coaster of love and sickness with Abigail.  The story is<br />inspirational as well as Abigail and the supporting characters are Christians<br />who openly express their devotion to God and their belief that he owns the key<br />to their destiny.  There are many likable characters in UNCONDITIONAL as well<br />as a villainess who you will find yourself wanting to shake.  What I liked<br />most about UNCONDITIONAL was that the characters seemed to cross cultural<br />borders.  Although they were African American, I could easily see a woman of<br />any race dealing with these issues in the same way.<br /><br />UNCONDITIONAL by A.C.

Shine	It can be a common occurrance for people to think that God has deserted them in times of need, or to blame God for their station in life. Lynn Austin's A LIGHT TO MY PATH, the latest of her books about the Antebellum South, examines this while detailing the coming of age of two young slaves, Anna and Grady, who have given up hope that \\"Massa Jesus\\" hears their prayers or cares what becomes of them.<br /><br />Anna's first memory is the day her parents were recaptured after an attempted escape from slavery. Since that day, she has had little faith that God could do anything to help her situation. While she was spared from death or the auction block, Anna's life is, nevertheless, one of biting criticism, harsh servitude, and endless longing. A glimmer of hope for something better comes along when she meets Grady.<br /><br />Grady hates all white people after experiencing a tortuous auction where he was torn from his mother's care and later a stint as the assistant of a slave trader. Grady's stark reality leads him to believe that all white people are evil and that the only way to progress in life is to exact his revenge upon them someday.  Once a ladies' man, Grady is stunned by Anna's beauty and he begins to change his ways. But Anna and Grady come in contact with numerous obstacles, including the Civil War. They must put their trust in God's plan in order to victoriously emerge from the battles.<br /><br />A LIGHT TO MY PATH is historical Christian fiction at its finest, spanning time periods from Antebellum America into Reconstruction. The story never became dull, nor did it ever read like a sermon. Lynn Austin introduced all of her characters, both primary and secondary, and followed them through until the end, each lending a significant voice and contribution to this heartbreaking and divine saga. I was impressed with this book and hope to go back through the series and read all of the earlier installments.

Drama - Invisibly?	Nicolette Montana has never appreciated everyone being in her business and questioning her marital status.  In fact, she's hated it so much that she decided to deceive everyone and make an \\"invisible\\" husband for herself so that everyone would just leave her alone.  How could she even fathom that her made-up fantasy would possibly evolve into something real?<br /><br />After reeling from his last relationship, Byron Matthews never expected to fall in love or lust again; protecting his heart was his number one priority.  Unexpectedly meeting Nicolette on an airplane gave him more than he bargained for - in more ways than one.<br /><br />Being thrown together into a whirlwind romance was never in the cards for either one of these two lovebirds, but life isn't what we expect, is it?  Can they manage to help each other overcome their insecurities and boundaries of the heart?  They both find out that deceit is never the answer, but perseverance usually pays off in the end.<br /><br />The story had a nice flow to it, despite a few grammatical errors.  Although laced with humor and a clear depiction of the family everyone can relate to, MY INVISIBLE HUSBAND was a little bit unrealistic.  A highlight - this story sticks to the moral of honesty being the best policy, which is a lesson that most people need to learn.  If you're in the market for some drama, pick this one up; it's guaranteed to keep you reading.<br /><br />(RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by T.

Deception of Love	Sam Trahan became the matriarch of the Trahan family after the death of his grandmother Ma Louise. Her one dying wish was for Sam to recover her family's prized possession, the Black Madonna, a portrait of her great grandmother.  Since the portrait was stolen while in Sam's care, he will stop at nothing to ensure its safe return.<br /><br />Zora Redwood was madly in love with her fianc&eacute; Milton Alexander until the day he walked out on her. Zora was desperately trying to put the past behind and get on with her life when she is implicated as an accomplice in the theft of the Black Madonna.  Milton has stolen the portrait and after two months Sam has been unable to pinpoint his whereabouts.  Sam knows that the only way to find Milton would be to enlist Zora's help. However, Zora is very adamant about not helping him and tells him in so many words.  Sam, who has never had a problem with getting his way, is taken by surprise when she refuses.  When Sam threatens to press charges against her, Zora has no choice but to agree to help.<br /><br />Janette McCarthy Louard has written an interesting novel filled with suspense.  The book was well-written but the author spent, in my opinion, too much time on the mystery of finding the painting rather than the budding romance between Sam and Zora.  I did enjoy how the tale surrounding Rose Hall was intricately woven into the framework of this book.  All in all, PORTRAIT OF DECEPTION was a wonderful read and I look forward to reading other novels by Ms. Louard.

Taking care of business...	It's no secret that for many years, even in this day and age, that women are often deemed inferior to men, and that our rightful duties are taking care of hearth and home, and leaving the work to the men.  In Beverly Jenkins' novel VIVID, we are introduced to Viveca Lancaster, an African-American female physician.  Anxious to put her medical degree to work, Viveca, or Vivid as she is better known, applies for a position in the small town of Niles, Michigan.  When she learns that the job is hers, she's ecstatic.  That is, until she meets Nate Grayson, the mayor of Niles.<br /><br />Nate is surprised, to say the least, when he learns that the doctor he allowed his aunt to hire is a female.  When he discovers his aunt's duplicity, Nate is determined to put Vivid on the first train back to where she came from and hire a real doctor, a male doctor.  Nate soon discovers that Vivid is a woman of inherent strength and one who is determined to prove herself capable of the job at hand.  After much persuasion, Nate finally decides to give Vivid a chance to prove her worth, and in the process discovers an attraction to the feisty doctor.<br /><br />I must admit, I've never been much of a history buff, and because of the historical nature of the majority of Beverly Jenkins books, it was my intention to avoid her books at all costs.  Thanks to the advice of a dear friend of mine, I learned that I may have been a bit presumptuous in my decision, so I decided to give Ms. Jenkins' historical romances a try.  VIVID was my first Beverly Jenkins read, and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />Ms. Jenkins tell her stories with such realism, it's as if she actually lives in the era of which she writes.  I also like the fact that the heroine in this novel was not one of those weak-willed women who felt dependent upon a man to be someone.  Instead, she was strong-willed and ready to fight tooth and nail for what she believed in.  VIVID was a sensually romantic story and one in which the brief history lesson we are treated to enhances, and not detracts, from the story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersich the brief history lesson we are treated to enhances, and not detracts, from the story. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Renee Williams <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2005-01-23

Education is Political	ACCIDENT OF BIRTH by Heather Neff is not just a story of a romance between an African-American woman and a Liberian man; it is also a story of political unrest in Liberia.  When Reba Freeman attends a fictional historical and religious Christian college in Baltimore, Maryland, she meets and falls in love with Joseph Vai Thomas.  Joseph is majoring in Education with hopes of returning to his country to form a school to educate his villagers.  What begins as typical college lust quickly spirals into a passion-filled romance with consequences neither Reba nor Joseph can imagine.  Something so egregious occurs that Joseph runs back to his native land and Reba is left to wallow in her sorrows in the United States.<br /><br />Twenty years later Reba is married with one child and living in an affluent Northern Virginia suburb.  She also works for the Office for the Placement of Permanent Refugees.  Joseph is imprisoned for crimes against humanity in Switzerland.  Upon learning of his fate Reba uses her professional training to locate him, but her unresolved feelings wreak havoc in her household.<br /><br />Neff expertly takes the story from present day to the past and back again as she allows the reader to become fully enveloped in Reba and Joseph's courtship and its affect on her family and friends.  Utilizing settings such as the Baltimore-Washington metro area, Detroit, Reba's birthplace, and the cities of Monrovia and Taylorville, Liberia, we get a visual sense the characters' surroundings.  We are treated with lessons of the political and educational climate in both the United States and Liberia and finally, the relationships and misunderstandings among African-Americans and Africans.  Neff allows her characters to grow and change through the course of the novel with detailed accounts as to how and why.  Excellent work, highly recommended and could serve as a basis for a truly educational discussion.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

It's raining dogs...	COZY STORM begins with the main character, John Long, reminiscing on how beautiful a thunderstorm can be when lovers snuggle close and embrace with all the love they have for one another.  It seems to set the tone for a novel that feasts on sex, lies and murder.<br /><br />26 year old John Long is married to the very young 18 year old Stacy.  Their struggling marriage reaches a point where Stacy decides to leave John because of his jealousy and need to control.  Distraught over her leaving, John decides he cannot just wait on Stacy to return and embarks on two relationships.  He starts dating Cheryl Johnson, who is a co-worker and Jennifer, a nurse he meets in a bar.  Each of the women offer him a welcome distraction from the deterioration of his marriage.  However, it seems John has taken on more than he can handle so he uses lies and deception to maintain both relationships.  When Stacy decides she wants to reconcile, John must make a decision on the importance of his marriage.  On the day Stacy is to return, she is found missing and John finds himself a suspect in her disappearance.  Have his lies and deception caught up with him?<br /><br />The opening paragraph of COZY STORM gives readers a feeling that they will be embarking on a novel full of sensitivity and romance.  As readers read on, they will find the characters stereotypical and one-dimensional.  Opportunities presented themselves to avail the author to deepen the main character's emotions, but it never happened.  Because of the lack of emotional depth and development of the characters, it tended to make the story unbelievable especially with the flow of the novel being motivated by sexual escapades.  I know the author can paint a picture with his words from the opening paragraph, so I was disappointed to find that passion not expressed throughout the novel. However, I did appreciate the author's message about the effects lies and deceit can have on others.

Change is Gonna Come	Have you ever felt like you're in a rut; like your life has come to a stagnant standstill and the situation is smothering you? In Franklin White's POTENTIALLY YOURS, Synthia felt this all-too-common phenomena, but the attacks of September 11, 2001 brought her out of her daily trance and snapped her back to reality.<br /><br />Beginning with Synthia's vow to change her life and reduce the negativity she feels surrounds her, readers are introduced to a lively cast of characters.  POTENTIALLY YOURS includes multiple protagonists; everyone from Synthia's teenaged daughter to Lil' Shae, a famous rapper, make their voices heard.  The book provokes readers to take a good, hard look at the way they are living and invokes the themes that life is not promised and time offers no guarantees.<br /><br />POTENTIALLY YOURS has a lot of potential.  It's a great story of making positive changes, weeding out negativity, and taking leaps of faith.  However, I thought the editing could have been a little tighter. Distracting errors, like Byron being referred to as Bryon, and just general grammar detracted me - but just a little.  Overall, I was pleased with the reading experience that Franklin White presented in POTENTIALLY YOURS.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
In the eye of the storm...	First there was Delaney.  Then came Dare, Thorn and Stone.  And now there's Storm.  Who or what am I talking about you ask?  I'm referring to none other than the Westmoreland siblings featured in the Westmoreland family series written by the highly acclaimed author Brenda Jackson, of course.<br /><br />Storm, like his brothers before him, never believed that he would fall prey to the fatal shot of Cupid's arrow.  But when love calls, you have to answer.  While in New Orleans on a business trip, Storm runs into Jayla Cole, the now grown-up daughter of his deceased boss.  Sparks fly, and before he knows it, Storm's attitude about love and happiness takes flight on the gossamer wings of love, leaving him a changed (for the better) man.<br /><br />It would seem that connecting stories would get a little stale and old, but this is not the case with the stories created by Mrs. Jackson.  Even though you know what the outcome of each book will be, Mrs. Jackson manages to pen a tale that will tug at your heartstrings and if you don't have one already, will make you wish for a man just like the ones described in her many novels.  Each one, including Storm Westmoreland, is sexy as sin, fiercely protective of all that is near and dear to their hearts and loyal to the love of their lives.  Although a mere 192 pages, RIDING THE STORM was a well-written, passionate, and romantic read that die-hard Brenda Jackson fans, such as myself, are sure to treasure and talk about for many days, weeks, months and years to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
We Can Do It	BY MY BROTHER'S SIDE is a story about the childhood of Tiki and Ronde Barber.  In the book, the two brothers are playing a little rough and Tiki injures himself.  He must spend the rest of the summer healing from the injury, but through all the ups and downs he can rely on his brother.  In addition, their supportive mother is always encouraging them to do their best, work hard and pursue their dreams.<br /><br />NFL football stars Tiki and Ronde Barber have come together to create an autobiographical tale with strong, positive messages.  This is a book that will appeal to all children, not just young football fans.  It is a nice addition to the body of children's fiction because it of its appeal to boys and positive male role models.  The plot teaches children that even if you are not the biggest or strongest, if you work hard it is possible to make dreams into reality.  In addition, Tiki's character provides a positive example of how to handle adversity; while Ronde demonstrates how to support those you care about when they experience hard times.  Most importantly, BY MY BROTHER'S SIDE highlights the special love and companionship shared between siblings.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay, Children's Editor<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Simple	TREASURES FROM A NUBIAN HEART is a compilation of poems which are simplistic in nature, but are profound in thought.  The poems range from those that honor the author's deceased parents to those that embrace the beauty of our heritage.  After each poem is a section for readers to write their thoughts regarding each of the poems. This was a welcome addition to encourage readers to allow their feelings to flow and to document their impressions of Ms. Gregg-Thomas' poems.<br /><br />There were a few standout poems in this collection I thoroughly enjoyed such as, \\"Behind Closed Doors\\", which encourages hope.  I also found the poem \\"Happy To Be Nappy\\" to be a wonderful display of the beauty of African-Americans even if America doesn't understand our ethnicity.  The author also includes an inspiring poem titled, \\"In The Midst of...\\" for the victims of the September 11th tragedy.<br /><br />Simplistic is the best word to describe TREASURES FROM A NUBIAN HEART.  The poems are easily understood and seem to reflect the author's feelings on varying subjects.  Although the poems are simple and to the point, the compilation didn't on a whole really inspire overwhelming emotions; it does personify a simple approach to poetry writing where readers don't have to guess what the author is trying to convey.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
The Saga Continues	THE BEST-KEPT SECRET is the third book by Kimberla Roby featuring the infamous character, Reverend Curtis Black.  In it, he is rebuilding his life - again, and hoping that the marriage to his newest wife, Charlotte, will succeed.  He has left Chicago, and started a new church.  The new church was a carefully planned endeavor; Curtis and Charlotte wrote the by-laws and hand selected the governing body with hopes of avoiding some of the power struggles he encountered in churches he pastored prior.  Curtis has slowed down considerably, trading his womanizing role for that of a family man dedicated to raising his young son to the best of his ability.  While on the surface things look great for him both professionally and on the home-front, things are not always as they seem.  Curtis just may have met his match with his young wife, and add to that a healthy dose of betrayal, old skeletons and lots of conflict and you have a story that is sure to please.<br /><br />Although I may not be anxious to see a fourth book featuring Curtis Black's character, I really enjoyed following his evolution from Casting the First Stone to THE BEST-KEPT SECRET.  While the book could stand alone, knowing the history behind the various characters will make this a much more interesting read.  My only real issue with this book was that I felt like a lot of the events that occurred in the story had happened before in an earlier book, just with different characters playing pivotol roles.  This made the story less believable simply because it seemed unrealistic for Curtis to find himself amid such over-the-top, once-in-a-lifetime, dramatic events more than once.  Still if any character would be swimming in drama, it would surely be Curtis Black, and because of that I still give the book an above average rating.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
A Bigger and Better Machine	In ROY MAKES A CAR, Mary Lyons presents a story originally collected by the legendary Zora Neale Hurston.  In it, we meet Roy Tyle, considered by most to be the best mechanic in Eatonville, Florida.  Roy, frustrated by his belief that automobile accidents are the result of poorly constructed cars, claims that he could build a better, safer car.  He sets out to do just that and creates a series of vehicles that have locals, out-of-towners, and even God himself, talking.<br /><br />This story is a pleasant read that young children are sure to enjoy.  It has a delightful cadence and the use of language is sure to inspire some laugh-out-loud moments.  Terry Widener's illustrations are as big and bold as the yarn that unfolds and I highly commend Lyons for her stellar adaptation of this story.  Additionally, I appreciate the fact that books such as ROY MAKES A CAR ensure that future generations are exposed to these stories and that folk tales such as this one will not be lost.

Deception	Gloria Baker had it all:  the house, the job, the money, the cars, the status, the friends and the perfect husband.  Gloria was living the luxurious life, which was a huge accomplishment for a small town girl from Monroe, Vermont.  She is traumatized when her husband Trai, an esteemed physician, dies in a car accident.  Gloria's grief is short-lived when she finds out that Trai has been untruthful to her throughout their entire marriage.  Her so called friends deserted her and everything she worked so hard to achieve was unexpectedly taken away.  Once again, Gloria finds herself in Monroe when she returns to live with her parents.<br /><br />Gloria's father asks the illustrious Jackson Montgomery to fix up the tiny cottage located on their property.  Jackson has not seen Gloria since high school and is awestruck by her beauty.  Gloria feels that he is beneath her because of his refusal to leave the small rural town.  After spending countless hours together, the attraction and friendship they share grows stronger.<br /><br />A HEART'S AWAKENING is a touching novel filled with betrayal, murder and romance.  Reader's will hate Trai, and in the same breath fall in love with Gloria and Jackson.  The novel is well-written with an intriguing storyline.  I was held captive in the pages of this novel, trying to solve the mystery surrounding Trai's death.  It was such a fast-paced easy read that I did not want the book to end.  Veronica Parker has done an outstanding job with this book, and I am looking forward to reading her other novels.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23
Computer Love	Tired of always doing what everyone else thinks is best for her, computer guru Cara Williams becomes a fitness trainer, much to the disappointment of her father.  However, after developing a software program, she decides to return to the computer field.  Cara's decision is based solely on the fact that for once, she will finally get the chance to have total control.  Her love life is non-existent because in her quest for freedom she also dumps her domineering boyfriend.  When a dumbbell is dropped by one of her clients, it lands on the foot of the illustrious A. J. Gray, the president of Capital Computer Consulting.  He suddenly finds himself being caressed, comforted and then whisked off to the gym's infirmary by Cara.<br /><br />After their encounter, A. J. wants nothing more than for Cara to accept his dinner invitation.  Cara on the other hand has other plans; plans that do not include him.  When her best friend arranges for her to meet with a consulting firm regarding her computer software, Cara is shocked when she learns that A. J. is the owner of the company.  Believing he has been given a second chance to win her affection and against the rejections of the partners in the firm, he personally takes on Cara's project.  When someone starts hacking into Capital's main computer system, A. J., already overworked, is at his wit's end trying to figure out why.  Knowing he will refuse her help, Cara decides to do a little investigating of her own.<br /><br />Robyn Amos has penned a very poignant love story filled with romance and suspense.  I thought I had figured out the hacker's identity in the first few chapters of the novel, but the very talented Ms. Amos threw in a curve ball.  I thoroughly enjoyed A. J. and Cara's journey to finding true love and happiness.  PROMISE ME is a well-written novel that will delight readers for years to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-23

A Victim of Circumstance	We can't choose our parents or where we are raised, but we can, however, make the most out of whatever situation we are placed in.  Whether you are raised in a suburban area or in the projects, the choices you make can either make you or break you. HOOD RICH by Crystal Perkins-Stell is a look inside the life of a young man who chooses the path given instead of the path out of the hood.<br /><br />DeMarques Prince, affectionately called Prince by his family and friends, was born and raised on the mean streets of Detroit, Michigan. Having a loving family did not influence Prince to take the good road, instead he opted to follow in his Uncle Silk and big brother Ant's footsteps and survive in the game of selling drugs. At an early age Prince could be found skipping school, staying out until the wee hours of the morning or learning the drug game from Ant. Not having any positive role models in his life, Prince followed by example. His loyalty was to Ant, who acted as a father figure and was truly his brother's keeper. Raised in a fatherless home and with a mother who really didn't know anything about parenting, Prince became a victim of circumstance.<br /><br />Prince makes a few stupid decisions early in his life and ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time. Having to make a choice between loyalty and freedom, life as he knows it changes for the worse. Wondering if the decision he made was a wise one, Prince has no choice but to lie in the bed he made. Being unfairly treated in the judicial system, Prince manages to keep his head up in spite of his circumstance. He never gives up hope that things will eventually work in his favor.<br /><br />HOOD RICH is a raw, riveting and captivating novel that will surely open your eyes to life in the hood. Watching as Prince grows from a troubled teen to a wise caring man will surely tug at your heartstrings. The most enjoyable part of the book was how strong the characters were developed and the look inside the mind and heart of a teen searching for his place in the world. The loyalty Prince had to his family was undeniably strong but at times foolish as he put his brother first when in essence he should have been looking out for self. The surprise twist at the end left me with my mouth hanging open; it was thrilling and suspenseful. Perkins-Stell has crafted a best seller. Those who have a love for Urban Fiction will definitely love this book, and those who don't may find themselves jumping on the urban fiction bandwagon.

The View From Here	For over ten years Montel Williams has visited our homes through his daily talk show The Montel Williams Show.  When he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), he initially tried to hide his illness and his pain from his family and his fans.  Eventually, he was forced to share a deeply personal struggle with his family and the public.  Since his diagnosis, Montel has struggled with unbearable physical pain, depression, and countless other MS symptoms.  At the same time, he was trying to balance his professional obligations, care for his children, and cope with a failing marriage.  By no means was any of this easy for him, in fact on more than one occasion he nearly committed suicide; but through perseverance, support and hard work he has continued pushing forward.<br /><br />In an effort to educate others, he candidly shares some of the most personal aspects of his life.  In addition to talking about how MS has impacted him personally, Montel shares some of the issues surrounding the disease.  He talks about the lack of research on the disease; the exorbitant cost of drugs used to treat its symptoms, and provides a rather lengthy argument for the need to legalize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.  At the conclusion of the book, he includes a round table discussion with several physicians well-known in the area of MS.  He asks all kinds of questions of these experts, ranging from the potential causes of the disease, various traditional and non-traditional treatments, and diet.<br /><br />CLIMBING HIGHER is so much more than a book about MS because in addition to talking about his personal challenges with the disease, Montel sprinkles in a lot of his general life experiences.  This made the book more interesting, and definitely made it a more personal read.  I appreciated his candor, his willingness to share his deepest thoughts and fears, and his willingness to share information with others that may be dealing with the disease but do not have the means or resources to get the kind of expert information and treatment that he can.  This is a book that will educate, touch, and inspire all readers, particularly those that are personally dealing with the disease.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewershe means or resources to get the kind of expert information and treatment that he can.

Unnoticed...	When mentioning the Civil Rights movement, we automatically think of Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, and other adults who spoke out against inequality.  However, the role of children and young adults is not often discussed, and it should be.  A SWEET SMELL OF ROSES by Angela Johnson takes a step in sharing their involvement.<br /><br />The book opens early one morning as two girls sneak out of their house to join a civil rights march. They run through the streets and upon meeting the others, listen as Dr. King talks of peace, love, and nonviolence.  They then join the march as protestors shout along the sidelines and police observe the group.  Finally, they stop in the middle of town as King again takes center stage. Afterwards, they run back home late in the afternoon to find their mother waiting, with a worried face.<br /><br />THE SWEET SMELL OF ROSES is written as a tribute to the many children and young adults who took part in the fight for justice during the Civil Rights era.  Though I can't really imagine younger children leaving their houses without permission, racing through the streets alone, joining a march, and staying out all day, it could've happened, as the times were a bit safer for our children. Additionally, there are likely other areas they participated in as well and I would've loved to see that incorporated in the book.  Better yet, to have them joining their parents in the march would've been more age-appropriate.<br /><br />The illustrations are highly detailed, done in black and white, capturing the tone of the book. Additionally, the writing is easy to understand and children may enjoy it in a reading circle type of scenario, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.  It doesn't fit the projected age group. It is, however, a great look into the history of the Civil Rights Movement and a nice way to introduce children to it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Let us pray...	I've always heard the saying that preacher's children are sometimes some of the worst children on the planet.  They slap on their holy and righteous facade around other Christians, but when they are in private, they become bigger devils than Satan himself.  In his latest release, THE PREACHER'S SON, Carl Weber takes that saying to a level so extreme, you may find yourself sneaking a deeper look at the life of a preacher's child that you may know.<br /><br />Dante and Donna are the children of Bishop T. K. Wilson, the pastor of one of the largest churches in Queens, New York.  As such, they are expected to carry themselves in a manner pleasing to God, and one that will not bring shame or reproach upon their father's good name.  Being saved and sanctified is the furthest thing from each of their minds as they continually engage in some of the freakiest, most unrighteous and sinful acts that they can think of.  But just as the Bible says, what's done in the dark will come to light.  When the switch is flipped, it gets real ugly and who's left standing is anybody's guess.<br /><br />In all my years of reading, I've only read one or two books by Weber, including this one.  Out of those few, THE PREACHER'S SON was the best I've read by him.  The secret lives of each of the characters are so outrageous that all I could do was shake my head as I eagerly flipped the pages trying to see what would happen next.  All of the characters, whether primary or secondary, had their own distinct voice, and Weber seamlessly stepped into each character and really brought them to life.  Just as I neared the end of the book, and thought that there couldn't possibly be anything else that would shock me about the Wilson family, Weber proved me wrong.  He throws in a shocking twist that hits you like a ton of bricks.  If you're looking for a good read to escape the pressures of life, pick up a copy of this book.  You won't be disappointed.

An end to segregation	As segregation ended, two boys, one white, one black, celebrated their friendship.  They looked forward to the fact that they'd finally be able to swim in the town pool together.  Though both were aware of their color differences, they were best friends and hung out together during the day.  When laws are passed to end segregation, the boys thought it would mean big changes were going to overcome their small Southern town.  Unfortunately, this is not the case as they learned when they get to the pool to see it being filled with cement.<br /><br />FREEDOM SUMMER was a very eye-opening acknowledgment of racism, narrated by a young white boy.  While blacks celebrated the Civil Rights Act being passed, there were whites all across the South who refused to cooperate and open their doors in equality for all.  Instead, they found it better to close establishments, treat blacks poorly, or come up with other loopholes -- in the case of this book, by shutting down a public pool.<br /><br />The dialogue between the two boys is innocent and hopeful, and the images created by Jerome Lagarrigue are subtle, yet inviting.  This book speaks volumes on racism and friendship, and reminds one that treating others justly should not be limited by skin color. It is a great lesson on history as it touches on the emotional impact of civil rights and integration.  I'm happy to see that this book has been awarded both the Coretta Scott King Award and the Ezra Jack Keats Book Award, because it is not only wonderfully told, but is educationally sound. It would make a wonderful addition to any child's library, regardless of race.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Uncovering the Truth	THE COLOR OF FAMILY is an intricately woven tale about family secrets and the search for truth.  Antonia Jackson has lived her adult life mourning the loss of her twin brother Emeril, who died as a result of a tragic and fatal series of events.  Before his death, he carried on a relationship with a young white girl named Agnes who was intimately known by many men - both black and white.<br /><br />Over 30 years later, Antonia is living in Baltimore, but she still carries, with deep conviction, the belief that her brother fathered a child by Agnes.  This child, a son named Clayton, was born nine months to the day of Emeril's untimely death.  He has grown up to become a world-renowned pianist, and in Antonia's opinion, is unaware of his true bi-racial heritage.  This unyielding belief has led Antonia to hold a grudge against Agnes for over thirty years.  More importantly, her obsession with Clayton Cannon and her brother's legacy have interfered with her relationship with her husband and her now adult children.  As the story evolves, Antonia and her family reach an emotional stand-off and the only ending to the tension and drama is to learn the truth once and for all.<br /><br />Patricia Jones' posthumously published novel, THE COLOR OF FAMILY is a true testament to a very talented writer.  This is the kind of book that readers seeking a deeper, more reflective story, with a literary feel will embrace and enjoy.  The plot has a slow, deliberate pace that is both necessary and frustrating at times.  It addresses a myriad of complex themes, including motherhood, familial bonds, and betrayal.  The story is built around strong, lingering characters that have been thoroughly developed.  The result is a story that will have readers eager to learn whether Antonia is crazy, like her children suspect, or whether she will finally prove her theory about Clayton Cannon's paternity.  This is a complex tale about identity and familial love that transcends time and racial boundaries.

Through the storm...	What do you value most in your life?  Is it the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the roof over your head, or the amount of money you have in the bank?  Does being the center of attention bring you joy and if so, do you tend to look down upon those who aren't in the societal class you're in?  Do you focus more on your outer being or your inner self?<br /><br />The above aptly describes Ms. Channa Renee Jones.  She's a diva through and through and wears the title as proudly and confidently as she sports the designer labels in her expansive, expensive wardrobe.  She's on top of her game, and wants everyone to know it.  Channa believes she is infallible, and only thinks to pray to God when she wants something to go her way.  With one fell swoop, Channa's life suddenly changes and she is literally brought to her knees.  Everything she held dear is suddenly no longer and Channa must stand strong in the face of adversity if she is to weather the storm.<br /><br />I must admit that when I first started reading SUNSHINE HAS RAIN, I was not immediately impressed with the character and her shallow, superficial ways.  I often wanted to reach inside the pages and slap some sense into her and make her realize that everything that glitters isn't always golden.  But the more I read, the more I became caught up in the story, wondering what would happen next.  As Ms. Henderson delved deeper into her storyline, I found myself totally engrossed in this very realistic portrayal of one woman's realization that in this thing called life, we must go through the storm in order to fully enjoy the sunshine.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Experiencing the Best	I WAS MADE IN THE SECRET PLACE is a thirty day devotional for women.  Each day Jennifer Briggs presents a scripture reference, followed by her personal testimony on the topic and concludes with an assignment.  The assignments are challenging both emotionally and spiritually and require a great deal of soul searching and self-reflection.  The topics covered in the book are diverse and encompass many of the issues Christian women encounter in day-to-day living.  Some daily activities also include prayers and inspirational quotes from such people as Maya Angelou, Mark Twain and Helen Keller.<br /><br />Overall, this was an enjoyable book that urging readers to look deeper and expect more from their relationship with God.

Big Shoes to Fill	Have you ever felt like a little person amid a group of giants?  This was Hewitt Anderson's everyday existence in the book HEWITT ANDERSON'S GREAT BIG LIFE.  His parents, descendents of a long line of giants, have lived their life with the belief that bigger is always better.  So when their son was born tiny and didn't seem to grow, they were so concerned that they took him for medical evaluations.  Yet, they loved their son unconditionally and did all they could to ensure he could survive as a little person in a great big world.  In the process, they all learned to appreciate Hewitt's unique talents and abilities.<br /><br />Loosely inspired by the fairy tale Jack in the Beanstalk, this book was a lot of fun to read.  The author has penned a story that implicitly reminds children that it is okay to be different.  The warm, inviting illustrations are detailed enough to hold a child's interest and further draw them into this gargantuan story.  However, word count and vocabulary may be a little too difficult for very young children to read without assistance.  This book is so much more than a mere retelling of a classic fairy tale with black characters, it is a story destined to be a classic on its own merits.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
An interlude on Private Thoughts	Giving not only a glimpse, but a full-blown picture of various areas in which most aren't willing to share their full views, Andrew Oyefesobi opens the door to his private thoughts on many issues in our society.  He covers the scope and range perused by many, yet only voiced in public by a few.  He travels from the domain of familiar poetic renditions such as love, life, and lust.  And then displays more serious issues such as justice, power, and respect, in addition to pride and faith in a bold, direct, and powerful interlude of ones' mind.<br /><br />There are so many eye-opening pieces in this collection that to single one out individually would be an injustice to the others.  Oyefesobi visits a spectrum of topics such as integration, political elections, self-love, journeys toward love, and many others.  Each poem speaks vividly and forces the reader to listen intently and reflect on the words.  My only grievance with the book is the cover. It leads you to believe the book is more of a sexual nature and the title throws the reader off a bit. In spite of this, the author does prepare the reader with the following sentence on the front cover, \\"Only open minds can stomach another's open soul.\\"<br /><br />Oyefesobi's writing is intense, and unlike other poets, he has skillfully mastered his voice and the nuances of his deepest thoughts in a manner in which it's not necessary to actually hear him live. ITCHY PRIVATES is an inspiring, intriguing, and informational collection of poetry that will appeal to poetry lovers everywhere.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A tasty memoir	Maya Angelou is well-known for her literary prose, her singing, and even time spent in the company of many celebrities, however it's not commonly known that she was also a cook. In her latest book, HALLELUJAH! THE WELCOME TABLE, she shares not only her delectable recipes, but also a bit more about her life, making this book stand out as a memoir as well.<br /><br />Ms. Angelou takes the reader on a journey through growing up under the tutelage of her grandmother along with her brother Bailey. The warmth felt for family spreads throughout her memories and wafts into each of the recipes presented in the book.  After each story, she shares recipes for all types of food, all of which appear easy to prepare, with ingredients easily found in the aisles of your favorite grocery store.<br /><br />I enjoyed my time spent in Ms. Angelou's kitchen and would recommend this book to those who have a knack for cooking and also those with zeal for life.  I'm a Southern girl -- also raised in Arkansas, not too far from Stamps -- and some of the recipes such as the crackling corn bread and the hog head cheese brought back memories from my own childhood and how I refused to eat both.  This book is not just a simple cookbook, but is filled with remembrances of times past, of a wonderful family, and the historical background of the recipes.  It was heartwarming, funny at times, and left me anxious to try out the recipes.  First on my list is the caramel cake and then either the coconut cake or the chocolate fudge.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14

She has worked her way from Philadelphia's inner city to mixing and mingling with a virtual who's who of Philly's powerful elite.  However, her rise to the upper echelons is part of an intricately designed plan to work the system from the inside and execute her plan for revenge.<br /><br />BETRAYAL OF THE TRUST is a nicely done political thriller that addresses issues of racism, classism and sexism.  Once again, Leslie Esdaile-Banks showcases her ability to create strong female characters.  Laura Caldwell is fierce - not only does she possess the kind of physical attributes that make most men lose their cool, but she is intelligent, and when necessary, lethal.  My only issue with the book is that the story is so intricate and involves so many players that there were times I had a hard time keeping up with who was who.  In addition, because of the complexity of the plot, the author has to spend a great deal of time laying groundwork which caused the story to stall at times.  I would encourage readers to be patient because eventually, all of these details come together.  I was disappointed in the ending, but it is sure to encourage great discussions.  I highly respect the author for continuing to offer up works of fiction that are fresh and keep her from being pigeonholed into a particular genre of writing.

Playa, playa, playa...	Marriage.  Commitment.  What is it about these two little words that strike fear in the hearts of some men and usually prompts them to turn tail and run the minute their significant other (or flavor of the month) brings one of these words into a conversation?  In her latest release, THE PLAYA'S HANDBOOK, Brenda Jackson introduces us to Lance Montgomery, Sam Gunn, Phillip McKenna and Marcus Lowery.<br /><br />Sam, Phillip and Marcus have either loved and lost, or haven't loved at all, so instead of risking getting their hearts trampled on by ruthless women, they decide to see if there is any truth to the hype of being a playa.  Since none of them have any experience, they pick up The Playa's Handbook by Lance Montgomery who absolutely refuses to settle down.  Through his book, he encourages men everywhere to be playas, and to always follow the top ten rules of being a playa.  How will the guys fare in their experiment?<br /><br />Being a huge fan of Mrs. Jackson, I'm always eager to read her works because I know I'll enjoy them immensely, and will quite often pull a late night reading marathon because it's often hard to find a good stopping point.  THE PLAYA'S HANDBOOK was one that I hated to put down when work, sleep or other duties called.  Although it ends quite abruptly, readers will not be disappointed.

Real Life Courtroom Drama	On a June day in 1895, Lucy Jane Pollard was brutally murdered with an ax, and Edward Pollard, her 72 year-old husband, discovered her body.  Later, Edward claimed they had also been robbed of over eight hundred dollars in cash and gold coins.  In addition, he was fairly certain that some of his wife's dresses and linens were stolen.<br /><br />Three women found themselves on trial for murder as a result of the testimony of Solomon Marable, a mulatto man who admitted involvement in the crimes, yet each of the women denied any involvement.  What follows is a story wrought with drama and intrigue, filled with changing testimonies, and witness tampering.  The black community rallied to assist the women while they were in jail, raising funds for the women's legal defense and providing spiritual and emotional support.<br /><br />Suzanne Lebsock has presented a thoroughly researched and well-written account of a crime that changed a community.  She presents the facts in an organized yet interesting manner and leaves readers to draw their own conclusions about what really happened.  The book was an enjoyable read and at times I felt as if I was watching a documentary.  The facts she presents in the book are well-documented and included photographs, drawings, and maps.  She provided just the right amount of background information so readers could get a sense of what life was like at the time, without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail.  I enjoyed how she illustrated the way issues of race played into the Lunenburg story.  A MURDER IN VIRGINIA is a fine case study that puts \\"southern justice\\" on trial.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Danger at every turn...	There's just something about a romantic suspense story that whets my appetite.  I figure it's because those are two of my favorite genres.  And when it's written by the very talented, best-selling author Beverly Jenkins, I know I'm in for a real treat.<br /><br />In Jenkins' latest literary offering, we're introduced to Narice Jordan, a strong, take no prisoners heroine who doesn't hesitate to kick butt and take names in her quest to avenge her father's gruesome murder.  We're also reintroduced to Galen Anthony St. Martin, or Saint as he's better known, who was first introduced in her previous book, The Edge of Dawn.  Saint is a mysteriously sexy undercover brother who has been assigned by the President to solve the mystery of a missing gem, a gem that happens to have ties to Narice's father.<br /><br />THE EDGE OF DAWN was a terrific read, and Jenkins is a master storyteller.  From the very first page, you're caught up in the action and taken on a whirlwind ride with the characters as they race against time and forces, seen and unseen, in their attempt to solve the mystery before the situation takes an even greater turn for the worse.  Strong characters, a well-developed plot, laugh out loud moments, and heartwarming, romantically sensual love scenes all combined to make this novel one I will treasure always.

The stories are set in small-town Texas in the 1930's and 1940's.  They are multi-dimensional, featuring historical information about the life and times of the era while also presenting strong spiritual and moral lessons.<br /><br />Each chapter took various aspects of everyday life, such as planting a garden, and used these common, day-to-day activities as the backdrop against which important lessons are presented.  When Waddy D lets his vivid imagination and fear of ghosts get the best of him, it was his grandfather who calmly taught him how to face his fears.  When Waddy D and Papa Will encounter an angry lynch mob threatening the lives of blacks in their community, Papa Will teaches him the importance of protecting his family at all costs.  While tending the fields, Papa Will teaches his grandson the importance of being in tune with nature and with God.  The most important lesson, a theme carried throughout the book, is the importance of not letting barriers prevent success, or rather, the importance of busting through barriers.<br /><br />While the book is billed as fiction, it has a strong autobiographical feel to it.  The love and devotion Papa Will, showed his grandson was so sincere and felt so real that I couldn't help but empathize.  There were times when the pace of the book was a little too slow for my tastes, but in spite of this, the stories never failed to touch my heart.  In life, sometimes the most poignant memories we share with loved ones involve the everyday and mundane, and Waddy Wells deftly illustrates this point in this collection of stories about everyday life.

The past meets the present	It isn't often that authors writing in two different genres collaborate on projects, especially books out of their comfort zone and their area of specialty, but T. L. Gardner and Michelle McGriff are to be commended on their first joint effort.  Gardner normally writes horror while McGriff writes both mysteries and romances.  Alternating between past and present, THE LEGEND OF MORNING focuses on the characters' innermost feelings, their dark sides, and the things they'll do for love or revenge.  With a set of protagonists from the past and a set from the future, a connection is formed between the two as one meets the other.<br /><br />The Legend of Morning opens with a historical scene of Black Seminole Indians being used in the military to track down Indian tribes responsible for stealing property from white settlers.  The reader is quickly taken into the past to share experiences first hand.  The major incidents noted are the attack on a group of renegade raiders and the honor in which the Indians fought, specifically the Black Seminoles.  Flash a few scenes ahead and it's 1990 in Klamatee, Texas at a beautiful resort in Southern Texas.<br /><br />On the surface, a group of four semi-friends are taking a sort of retreat to get to know each other better and deal with their problems with one another. Yet beneath the lies and deceit, one woman has gathered together the three men in her life as a means of finally making sense of her situation.  She is married to one, wants the second one, and falls in the hands of the third.  Three men with three different roles in her life, yet she's convinced that at the end of their trip, she will have a better sense of the situation.  Each one is harboring their own conflicts with love, hate, jealousy, and the thin line that binds them together.  Upon arriving at the resort, they are greeted by the hostess, and later an Indian appears out of nowhere, introduces himself as Chuddy, and begins telling them the history and legend of the city.<br /><br />As the days pass, they continue to meet Chuddy for a continuance of the story as they learn about two Indians, as different as night and day, but both wrought with the pain of their current situations. However, through it all, one is still stronger in that he's learned to accept the wisdom of his gods.  When he receives an unforgivable blow, he sets his sights on revenge and stops at nothing until he gets it.  The other learns his true origin and becomes lost in a sea of emotions as he tries to figure out the why's of his life.  It soon becomes quite clear how the two will meet as the white townsmen have hired one to find the other.  Through reliving the past, the characters of the present are able to see the parallels and relate them to their own lives.  The only question is will they realize the wisdom of Chuddy before or after it's too late?<br /><br />Gardner and McGriff are to be lauded and commended for this new wave of fiction.  They label it a Western, though I would lean more towards speculative fiction, fantasy, or supernatural at the least.  Had the editing been a bit tighter and the timelines a bit clearer in places, this would've been without a doubt, a top rated book, receiving the highest rank possible from RAWSISTAZ.  Despite having those editorial flaws, the originality of the work still stands in a class of its own.  Not only that, but the story was vividly written. It was easy to picture the scenery, smell the smoke, and even feel the pain of the characters.  This is indeed one of my favorite reads of the year and also sits on my list of favorite books ever read.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A Time of Rebirth	The Harlem Renaissance is defined by artlex.com as a literary and art movement in the uptown Manhattan neighborhood of Harlem, in the mid and late 1920's. In author David Krasner's A BEAUTIFUL PAGEANT, he provides a detailed capturing of a historical time when great pride and creativity for African Americans was not an unusual occurrence.<br /><br />Many people tend to think of the Harlem Renaissance as a time when only literary notables such as Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes emerged, but it was so much more. There was a strong little theatre movement, great choreographers such as Ethel Waters and Aida Overton Walker, and most surprising to me, one of the most controversial sporting events of the time. The boxing match between Jack Johnson, a flamboyant and confident black fighter and Jim Jeffries who was known as \\"The Great White Hope\\", the hope of white people was that Jim Jeffries would prove that he was superior to the arrogant and inferior black man. When Jack Johnson was crowned the winner, it was a springboard to pride among African Americans.<br /><br />Before I read this book I had a general view of what the Harlem Renaissance was about, but after finishing it, I have a much broader insight into this special era represented and produced. David Krasner is a very thorough writer and I was impressed with the attention to detail and the fact that the book was researched in depth. But as informative and knowledgeable as this book is, I was very frustrated while reading it because of the microscopic print which made it very difficult to read. If the font size of the print was larger this would have been a much more enjoyable read and my rating would have been a 4 instead of a 3.5.  (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Not my kinda romance...	Reaching back on one of my bookshelves, I was drawn to the cover of LET THE ROMANCE BEGIN by Ellie Conrad and after skimming over the back cover decided I'd love to take a journey into a \\"seductive romantic novel that will firmly grab the reader's attention while titillating their erotic senses.\\"  Everyone needs a little romance right?  Well, after reading, I felt a bit mislead and more annoyed than titallated.<br /><br />Geneva and Derrick Fletcher are a semi-successful couple living in New Orleans.  Both are a bit bored by their twenty-two year marriage and need a bit of excitement or romance to liven things up.  Geneva is the owner of her own marketing firm, while Derrick is hoping to get a manager's slot at the music store where he works.  Both are somewhat content in their jobs, yet when Derrick decides to slip out and entertain another woman, the dynamics of the marriage changes.  When he goes too far, he rationalizes with himself that he has to do it again to make sure the passion is real.  In the process of continuing his affair, he becomes distant with Geneva.<br /><br />In turn, Geneva seeks attention via the emotional ear of another man who has made his intentions clear.  When the secret gets out about Derrick's infidelites, Geneva conveniently has a business trip planned and hi-tails it to lick her wounds and get control of her feelings.  Standing in the wings and ready to pounce is her admirer, just what she needs to get some romance and prove she's still a woman.  It's not clear where things will go, but Geneva and Derrick will both have to deal with their demons, communicate their desires, and build their own passion...but is it too late?<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I was looking for romance, love, and all those feel-good type of things to rekindle the marriage of the Fletchers, but what I found in the book was an annoyance with the characters and their actions.  While the potential for the story was great, I simply wasn't feeling it, the switch in tenses, or the out of character actions of our protagonists.  I will however say that some of the situations in this story threw an extra twist that made it an average read, smoothing out some of my distaste.  While I acknowledge that this is a work of fiction, I can only hope this isn't the route married couples take on their search for romance.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Through rose-colored glasses...	Marriage is such a sacred institution, but in this present day and time, it seems that it takes much more to make a marriage work.  In order to have a successful union, both parties must give it their all, and if all is not given, the sacredness of the vows taken becomes jeopardized, causing a rift that may or may not be so easily fixed.<br /><br />Regina Moore and Karen Jackson are both married to men they believe are the perfect spouses.  Almost simultaneously, Regina and Karen discover secrets about their husbands that threaten the very essence of all they hold dear.  Both women must do some serious soul searching, ultimately deciding whether or not they will fight for their marriages or if they should just cut their losses and move forward to the next phase of their life.<br /><br />BEHIND CLOSED DOORS is the very first novel ever penned by highly acclaimed author Kimberla Lawson Roby.  Although the storyline was predictable, Roby's story was well-written, complete with either characters you can identify with ones you want to slap some sense into.  All in all, this was a good book, and I can't wait to see what's next from Ms. Roby.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Dark and mysterious...	Nelson George is back in the first of a mystery series of books about the highs and lows of the life of Dervin \\"D\\" Hunter in THE ACCIDENTAL HUNTER.  D heads his own security business and has taken on the job of bodyguard to a couple of high profile music celebrities.  One of the stars, Night (from Night Work) has been kidnapped and D is hired to deliver the ransom and collect Night in return.  His other client is a young, white, teenie bopper, hoping to update her image with a little hip hop.<br /><br />Both assignments weigh heavily on D as he battles his own demons, such as his mother's new fiance', his HIV positive status, and problems within his team.  As if that's not enough, a motorcycle gang is always in the mix when it comes to his clients and D begins a little investigation of his own to find out who's behind the gang.  What he finds out could not only cost him his business, but friendships he's built along the way.<br /><br />THE ACCIDENTAL HUNTER was a dark, slow read for me.  The mystery of finding out who was behind the wrongdoing in the book kept me interested in the storyline.  But, all the references to singers, rappers, and name brands of this or that slowed me down a bit as I'm way behind in keeping up with the entertainment lifestyle.  I did however enjoy the character of D Hunter, his moodiness, seeing all sides of his character, and of course, watching him kick butt.  The ending of the book has me anticipating the next in the series.  (RAW Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Reflections....	ONE DAY'S PEACE...this is something we all seek.  If we can't get a day, we'll settle for an hour or even just a moment.  We all crave those moments of solitude when we can reflect on our life's journey, maybe shedding a few tears or laughing in sheer joy as we take a stroll down memory lane.  It is those moments, hours, days of peace that keep us sane and give us the fortitude to trudge on through the mire and muck that sometimes hinders our way.<br /><br />Author Tanya Bates offers readers a brief, but deep glimpse into her life with her literary offering of poetry.  Through her words, we are taken back into moments of self-discovery and inspiration.  The day I read this, I was in a somber mood and wondering why it felt like I was being singled out for more than my fair share of misery.  When I read the selection entitled Pressed, which basically asks why do we worry about the unimportant things in life, I immediately began to feel better.  It's amazing what a few, simple yet powerful words can do for a wounded spirit.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Keepin' It Real	AS REAL AS IT GETS is a multi-faceted tale that explores the lives of three friends, Reece, Charlotte, and Maxie.  Told from alternating points of view, the story allows readers to get to know the characters intimately. Early on, the three women take a vacation together and it is during this trip that some major life changes are initiated.<br /><br />Reece is always taking care of someone else; even as an attorney, she is always taking on pro bono work.  She is constantly striving to please her mother, her fianc&eacute;, and even her friends, but isn't quite happy herself.  Her fianc&eacute; is tired of waiting for her to set a date for their wedding, but Reece is still not ready to commit.  What will it take to get her down the aisle?  How far is she willing to go to experience true happiness?  And how will a handsome man she meets while vacationing fit into the mix?<br /><br />Charlotte is driven and is working hard to schmooze her high powered and wealthy real estate clients so that she can reach her personal goal for sales.  When she receives some shocking news before leaving on the trip, she decides to keep it to herself. Will she open up and rely on the help of her friends?  Will she survive the devastating events that follow?<br /><br />Finally, Maxie, the tough girl of the threesome, is a successful freelance journalist, yet, because of her horrific childhood, she is unable to fully enjoy life.  She was put into foster care and separated from her sisters years ago and has been unsuccessful locating them as adults.  When Reece hooks her up with a private detective, her hope to find her long lost siblings is renewed.  But does blood alone guarantee the bond of sisterhood? Will she find the courage to live life to the fullest?<br /><br />This is McKayhan's debut title, but I'm hoping it will not be her last.  Her writing was crisp and strong.  She deftly alternates between the points of view of the three women with the precision of a seasoned professional.  She keeps the tension in the book just right; as a result, I was always anxious to see what would happen next.  The characters were multi-dimensional and had enough flaws to be believable.  The book addressed such themes as being true to oneself, fidelity, forgiveness, and sisterhood, while tackling some heavy issues such as childhood abuse, and foster care.  In spite of the weighty topics covered, the plot wasn't bogged down with seriousness, instead, it was an easy read sprinkled with humor.  AS REAL AS IT GETS is an authentic example of a well-written and enjoyable mainstream fiction title.

A fascinating keepsake	Lucy Anne Hurston, the neice of Zora Neale Hurston, in a collaborative effort with the Estate of the great writer, has produced a beautiful tribute to her aunt and also a collector's item for fans of Zora Neale Hurston.  Not only does it include biographical sketches of the famous author, but also live interviews, as well as a CD of folk songs sung by Hurston.<br /><br />The pages of this book are rich in heritage, painting a kaleidoscope of her life.  Touching on her childhood, her days attending Howard University, and of course her writing, the reader is able to see that even though Zora Neale Hurston wrote about memorable characters, she too could have been one of the characters she wrote about.  Because of the replications of original letters, maps, photos and writings, the reader is given a more detailed account of her life, told by someone who knew and loved her.  Each of these are in pull-out sleeves and envelopes, easily removed from the book to allow closer inspection upon, or displayed vividly on the full color and black and white pages of the book.<br /><br />SPEAK, SO YOU CAN SPEAK AGAIN is a fascinating keepsake of a writer who means so much to not only the Harlem Renaissance and to African-American readers and writers, but also to literature as we know it.  Through this collection, readers are offered an intimate portrait of a literary legend.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Be Yourself	Stephanie is an extremely smart young lady, in fact, she is the best reader in her grade.  Most children spend a good portion of their day looking forward to recess time, yet for Stephanie, it is the most difficult part of her day.  In spite of her academic abilities, she is shy and has trouble making friends; and recess without friends can be a sad time.  She ventures out of her comfort zone and attempts to join in with other playing children.  Unfortunately, she isn't welcome and in spite of her efforts, she still spends her recess in the company of books.  After talking to her mom later that night, Stephanie realizes she needs to be herself - but will she figure out a way to be accepted by her peers?<br /><br />THE BEST RECESS EVER is a cute book, with pleasant illustrations.  I really liked the fact that the book dealt with an issue young readers may encounter in their day-to-day lives.  The characterizations were realistic and as a result, I found myself empathizing with Stephanie.  The theme of self-acceptance, and being true to self in spite of peer rejection, rings clear in this book and it is a worthy addition to any young child's library.  While in real life, the solutions to peer rejection may not be as simple as they were in this book, it will remind youngsters that they are not alone.

The Trouble With Relationships	Relationships often define our lives, whether they are romantic, platonic, or even family relationships. More than people realize, individuals have the power to control their role in a relationship, and to direct how that relationship is going to work.<br /><br />In FACING OUR SKELETONS, we meet Stella a woman in constant pursuit of a knight in shining armor. She's an intelligent, beautiful single mom and seems to have what so many women want. But she believes the hype that she needs a man to be whole and since she does not have one, it affects her self-esteem. She hungers for something that does not exist, the perfect romantic relationship.<br /><br />Stella experiences one bad relationship after another, accepting insensitive treatment by the men with whom she's involved. She is so busy concentrating on pleasing others her relationship with herself suffers. Stella has no idea who she is, and until she knows herself, how can she know what she wants to give or receive in a relationship?<br /><br />FACING OUR SKELETONS had the potential to be a really great story, but sadly it fell short. It starts out like a novel, but slowly seems to evolve into a self-help book with Stella preaching to readers about what they should not accept in a relationship. Another issue I had while reading this book was that the book was written in first person and there seemed to be no transitional statements. For example, Stella is telling her story and then all of a sudden she is involved in a conversation with a secondary character. This was very distracting to me and took away from the story. However, I did admire Stella. She never gave up on herself no matter what. With stronger transitions and stronger editing FACING OUR SKELETONS could be a good book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Memories can be deadly	The beautiful and intelligent Doreen Grant is living a dream. Upon receiving her law degree, she returned to her alma mater to teach. Teaching at Tillmore College gives her the opportunity to give back to the community and to spend time with her best friend since high school, Dr. Byron Holloway. Doreen is content with all aspects of her life except her love life.  Just out of a two - year relationship she isn't looking for love until the handsome and brilliant psychiatrist, Matthew Dennis, comes to Tillmore. Matthew and Doreen hit it off instantly.<br /><br />Matthew is renown  for using hypnosis in his practice. Due to the popularity and curiosity of the technique, Matthew arranges for public demonstrations with the student and faculty body at Tillmore. Curious as to why she loves mystery novels so much, Doreen agrees to be hypnotized to find the answer. What is uncovered during the hypnosis is that Doreen suppressed the childhood memory of witnessing her aunt's brutal murder. The revelation leads Doreen, Byron and Matthew on a journey to uncover the truth to tragic events that occurred twenty-five years earlier. During their investigation, Doreen and her friends learn that an innocent man went to prison for the crime, and a ruthless killer is still on the loose; closer to Doreen than anyone can imagine. The killer will stop at nothing to keep his identity and motives a secret, and that includes murdering again.<br /><br />TO SILENCE HER MEMORY by Madge D. Owens is a unique story line, it holds the readers'  interest despite the fact that some aspects of the novel read slower than others. Doreen, Matthew and Byron are a breath of fresh air in terms of characters. They are young, intelligent, professional African-Americans who have redeeming qualities. The villain is also a unique one with multiple layers of lies, deceit and nastiness. The ending is a bit of a let down only because it so obviously ends in a way that ensures that there will be a sequel.

Intimate Portrayal	THE SOUL OF A BUTTERFLY by Muhammad Ali is a deeply personal look at the man behind the big persona.  In it, Ali reminisces over many of the events that help shaped him into the individual who is known and loved around the world.  More important than the retelling of specific events, Ali focuses on sharing his spiritual journey, sharing some of the philosophy that has impacted him personally.  He shares some of his own poetry, some of which he made famous before his retirement from boxing, and others that are more introspective.  In addition, his daughter Hana Ali shares some of her poetry and several moving tributes to her father.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book overall, but I found that it was choppy and disjointed at times.  I also found myself craving more detail after reading many of the passages and as a result, I felt as if I missed many of the messages Ali was trying to share.  If you are looking for an in-depth biography that details names, dates and events, then THE SOUL OF A BUTTERFLY is not the book for you.  However, if you are interested in getting to know a public figure on a deeper, more intimate level, then pick this one up.

Santa's Kwanzaa	SANTA'S KWANZAA opens as an African-American Santa returns to the North Pole tired from the hard work of delivering Christmas presents.  When he arrives, he is greeted by his wife, the elves, and the beginning of their Kwanzaa celebration.  Each of the elves, named for the various principles of Kwanzaa, present Santa with their special gifts and share special meals as the family celebrates their rich heritage.  At the end of the story, Santa, his wife and all the elves pile into the sleigh to share a special message with the world.<br /><br />Some books are meant to teach while others are meant to simply be fun to read.  SANTA'S KWANZAA will introduce readers to the principles of Kwanzaa, through the names of the elves, but beyond that it is simply a fun read.  The story rhymes, with a meter similar to that of the classic Christmas story, \\"`Twas the Night Before Christmas,\\" as a result.  Unfortunately, there were times when the word choice seemed to be dictated by the need to rhyme versus the relevance to the story itself and this interrupted the overall flow of the story.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about the book was its illustrations, which were bright, vibrant and imaginative.  Santa had dreads, once he removed his trademark cap, and the elves appeared so full of life I almost expected them to jump off the page.  Pick this book up for a fun holiday read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Getting past the obstacles in life...	Before one can truly examine the issues in his/her relationship with others, they must first be aware of the weaknesses they possess both within and on the surface.  It is only then that they will be capable of truly living life and following their dreams.  In his January 2005 release, THE STRONG SILENT TYPE, C. Kelly Robinson has created a storyline and characters who leave the reader with a feeling of accomplishment and acceptance, as well as the inspiration that they can come to terms with what ails us.<br /><br />Deacon Davis is a former professional football player, turned director of the American Dream Party; established in the interest of African-American voters across the country.  He dreams of following in the steps of his father and<br /><br />living up to the legacy of the Davis name.  When he's forced to resign from his position as a result of stuttering through a nationally televised interview,  and later has a confrontation with his son's teacher, he falters and begins questioning himself.  Though he's always had problems with his speech, over the years he's learned how to hide his impediment.  Unfortunately, with the loss of his job he begins to question his self-worth and comes to the realization that he needs professional help.<br /><br />Deacon enrolls in a Speech Recovery Program and is assigned to Maria Oliver, a speech therapist on staff.  Maria has her own problems and finds herself not only trying to keep her mind off her personal problems, but also off the attraction she has to Deacon. Because of the ethics involved, Maria attempts to provide Deacon with the guidance necessary to conquer his fears of speaking. It's obvious they both have their own personal demons and baggage, but will they be able to overcome their issues?<br /><br />Most people have some type of baggage or obstacle in their lives which aid in making them feel inferior to others at time.  Through this novel Robinson has clearly shown how we can all persevere through past afflictions, learn to appreciate ourselves, and continue on the path towards our dreams.  Despite any type of struggle that exists, it is possible to move past it.  THE STRONG SILENT TYPE is a well put together package, one I could use to help understand my own family members who stutter.  The individual storylines add depth to the story and the bonus \\"mystery\\" throughout the novel adds an extra hint of suspense not normally mixed into the contemporary fiction novel.

Among my favorites was Tananarive Due's piece that described both her relationship with her mother and the journey the two of them took together in an effort to say goodbye to her grandmother and settle her affairs.  Reverend Dr. Suzan Johnson's piece highlights the need for mothers to juggle their various roles and responsibilities and was one I related to in spite of the fact that I am presently a stay-at-home mother rather than a mom who works outside of the house.  Faith Ringgold's \\"My Daughters and Me\\" speaks to the difficulties involved with getting through the teen and young adulthood years as a parent.  And Alice Walker's \\"Everyday Use\\" is sure to remind children to appreciate their mothers and to avoid taking them for granted.<br /><br />All in all, this was an enjoyable collection.  While readers may not be able to relate to every piece, there are sure to be several that will call to them loud and clear.  I found a couple of the contributions a bit laborious to read, but overall, I enjoyed this collection.  The purpose of this book was to pay homage to black mothers, and it not only achieved this goal but went several steps further, by highlighting many of the issues with which mothers contend.  Fans of poetry, prose, and short fiction alike, will find something that speaks to their specific reading tastes.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Sticks and Stones	In BEAUTIFUL ME, Wanda Thomas introduces us to Shanika and a group of her girlfriends.  As the school day ends, the girls decide to play double dutch.  Shanika, the only girl with a suitable jump rope, rushes home to retrieve her rope.  After the girls have played for a while, Shanika realizes that it is time for her to go home, and reluctantly tells the girls that she must take her rope.  The rest of the girls lash out at her and begin calling her \\"ugly.\\"  Shanika arrives at home, hurt by the mean-spirited chants of her classmates.  It isn't until she does a careful self-assessment that she reassures herself that she is beautiful and that her friends didn't really think she was ugly, but rather they were disappointed that their game had to end.<br /><br />Wanda Thomas reminds young girls that brown skin is beautiful and everyone should appreciate their own unique beauty.  Like Handsome Me, the companion book targeted towards young boys, BEAUTIFUL ME is a welcome addition to African-American Children's literature.  The only disappointing aspect of the book is that it tends to oversimplify the strong impact peers can have on self-image.  In addition, once Shanika begins to doubt herself, it seemed unrealistic for her to get over it so quickly.  Still, I recommend the book because of its positive message and its potential usefulness as a tool to prepare children for teasing before such incidents occur.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Choices...	B. J., Quita and Ebony are good friends who are each at a crossroads in their life.  None of them are in a serious relationship, so during one of their investment club meetings, they decide to make a date one night a week.  When they meet to discuss their latest investments, they will also apprise each other of the success or failure of their date.  The women soon realize jumping back into the dating scene is not as easy as they thought it would be.  And if the trials and tribulations of dating aren't enough, each must contend with some unexpected issues that force them to take a long, hard look at themselves and the life they are leading.<br /><br />DATE NIGHT was an average read; nothing really stands out that makes you want to grab this book and pull an all-nighter as you become engrossed in the storyline.  I was a bit disappointed that the book didn't live up to the blurbs I've read.  I expected a hilarious account of each woman's escapades as they tackled the dating scene in their quest to find Mr. Right, and rejoice with them when they did.  Sadly, that was not the case.  Instead, it was a story with only a little fizzle instead of a great big bang, with characters who could've been developed a bit more to make them strong, independent black women, instead of the weak, somewhat co-dependent women that they are.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
A mother's love	After her controversial debut The Wind Done Gone, a parody of Gone With The Wind, Alice Randall is back on the literary front with PUSHKIN AND THE QUEEN OF SPADES, a work of art presenting deeper observations on race, classism, interracial relationships, motherhood, family, and love.  Embedded in these themes are strands of humor, literary references, and a mother's love and frustration in protecting her son from the realities and cruelties of the world.<br /><br />Windsor Armstrong is a professor of Russian literature and has named her son Pushkin X after Alexander Pushkin, the Afro-Russian poet and Malcolm X.  She raised Pushkin with the hopes that he would one day follow in her footsteps, as an intellectual, not boxed in the same stereotypical class of many other black men.  Unfortunately, Pushkin has his own ideas and goals in life.  He excels in football, turns down a scholarship to Harvard, and eventually advances to the NFL, to the horror of Windsor.  When he announces his marriage to a white Russian lap dancer, Windsor finds herself lost in a myriad of emotions.<br /><br />\\"Pissed\\" would be the forefront emotion as she takes his announcement personally, wondering why he didn't choose a black woman, why he chose the life he lives, and how she can continue to love him, considering all of the issues she finds with him.  Tossing back and forth from the past to the present, she relives her life, her troubles, pain, and happiness, as she creates a wedding gift for Pushkin -- a narrative of her life.  Through the revelation of her disappointments, we're able to further understand her anger and the love she has for Pushkin.  In addition, we're given a multifaceted view of her character and her past.<br /><br />PUSHKIN AND THE QUEEN OF SPADES is an exploratory journey for Windsor as she searches for identity and reconciliation. It is at times moving, hilarious at others, but, nonetheless, adeptly addresses many concerns faced by parents.  It is definitely a book to be read slowly, up close and afar, to catch exactly what's going on throughout the pages. It is an exciting look into contemporary fiction with a literary edge.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Appearances Can be Deceiving	Terri Parrish's career as a stage performer took her from the bright lights of Las Vegas to the stages of Europe. Men fell at her feet and material possessions were hers for the asking. She had a dazzling personality that endeared her to audiences around the world. Life was perfect for Terri and nothing could bring her down from the pedestal she sat upon, or so she thought.<br /><br />The saying everything that goes up must come down is a lesson that Terri learns the hard way. The once desired and sought after entertainer becomes a slave to the crack pipe and nothing else matters but getting high. With her money dwindling Terri turns to prostitution and other illegal vices to obtain drugs. After landing in jail, she thinks her life is over, but her hell is just beginning. What follows is a tale of danger, drama, and murder.<br /><br />CHASIN' IT by Tony Lindsay is an urban drama with a twist, because things are not as they seem to be. This story takes readers to the depths and desperation of addiction and also teaches the lesson that being true to self is important. Even though Terri is twisted, selfish and at times pitiful, I found myself hoping that things would come together for her. Mr. Lindsay has a way of making readers care about his characters and I commend him for that. I am not a big fan of urban drama but after reading CHASIN' IT, I'm ready to give it an honest chance.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Body Count	Washington, D.C. police officer Leigh Ann Warren is on the run, she's being chased by feelings of guilt, uncertainty, and pressure. After her partner Duck is almost killed, as a result of her actions, she turns inward, becomes depressed and somewhat of a recluse. When a friend offers her their beach house on the North Carolina coast, she jumps at the chance to get away. Leaving her troubles behind will give her peace and help speed her recovery.<br /><br />On her journey to her coastal retreat, Leigh Ann is drawn to her hometown of Sunrise, North Carolina. What she intended to be a food stop, becomes so much more. She discovers that there are unusual things going on in her small town. A rich developer has created controversy by proposing a shopping mall over the  Black cemetery and the town has taken sides along racial lines.<br /><br />The unearthing of skeletal remains also unearths secrets and lies that were better left buried. Once the secrets come to the surface, all hell breaks loose. Since Leigh Ann is in a state of confusion with her career in law enforcement, she is determined not to get involved. But when one of the town's most beloved citizens becomes a fatality, her investigative skills are thrown into overdrive and her focus is on finding the killer.<br /><br />SUNRISE by Chassie West is an engrossing, page turning mystery. Leigh Ann is a woman with a tough as nails exterior, but inside she is a vulnerable woman who is trying to heal and move on with her life. The secondary characters in the story are an interesting group, and they add to the richness of Ms. West's storytelling; they were strong and memorable. I was so impressed with this book that I stayed up all night reading it. I plan to read the whole series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Taking Us Back...	Upon meeting Janis F. Kearney, one is presented with a combination of soft-spoken gentleness, wisdom beyond her years, and a quiet strength that isn't seen often in people anymore.  I've had the pleasure of meeting Kearney, and now after reading her memoir, I've had the opportunity to learn a bit more about her and how she came to have the above qualities. COTTON FIELD OF DREAMS, her debut title, is a beautiful heart-felt tribute to her family.<br /><br />It amazes me and touches my heart how such a large family with so few material possessions had so much that matters in life...love, support, and determination to succeed at all costs.  How is it that an uneducated sharecropper with 17 children can inspire his children to learn and to reach for the greater things in life?  How is it that those same children missed the first portion of the school year, but were still ahead of their class academically?  How is it that each of these children grew up to surpass the confines put on their parents and other poor blacks of that time period?  The book was so real to me, I shared in the family's happy times, their heartaches, their success, and the benefit of parents who inspired and instilled the importance of education.  I cried over the deaths in Kearney's family, rejoiced in the yearly reunion, and celebrated a great piece of African-American history and family.<br /><br />Kearney was the personal diarist to Clinton and also served in other positions during his campaign and years in office.  In the foreword he points out, \\"From their parents, the Kearney children absorbed a powerful conviction:  They were neither better nor less than any other human being.  This conviction gave them the self-confidence to move far beyond their difficult beginnings.\\"  It is this conviction, this type of upbringing, that is missing in the majority of houses today.<br /><br />COTTON FIELD OF DREAMS shares the lessons taught by our forefathers and brought to fruition by faith, trust, perseverance, and the desire to dream.  The writing is soft and soulful, the shared memories are heart-warming, and the final outcome of the Kearney children was simply awe-inspiring.  When one thinks of 17 children growing up in the South during the mid-1900s, it is unusual to picture them as lawyers, historians, and such in the present, but with the exception of one child, they all reached this level of success.  It just goes to show that materialistic wealth means nothing when compared to upbringing.  It all goes back to the parents, one of the most important aspects of a child's life.

Playing for keeps	One mistake.  That's all it takes to turn not only your own life upside down, but also the lives of those around you.  Throughout PLAYING WITH DESTINY, the mainstream debut novel of author Phill Duck, the author shows how each of the main characters and the antagonists make the mistakes of those in relationships, in doubt, or in turmoil with their inner selves.  His writing is emotional and touching, while at the same time dramatic and powerful.  I wanted the characters to work through their issues, to come to one accord, and to realize the importance of family and loving one another.<br /><br />My only grievance with the book was the ending.  I simply cannot believe the author chose to end the book in this manner, it was a set-up for a sequel, but in my mind, it could have ended here.  In spite of this, Duck does leave room for deep reflection on ones life and the destiny that awaits us.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

'Tis the Season	Some holiday songs focus on reindeers, Santa, even snowmen while others, such as O Holy Night, focus on the true religious story behind Christmas.  In the book O HOLY NIGHT: Christmas with the Boys Choir of Harlem, illustrator Faith Ringgold, has used her artistic talents to bring the lyrics to these more spiritual Christmas songs alive through her paintings.  Other songs featured in the book include: Hark the Herald Angel Sing, Joy to the World and Silent Night.  In addition, the book opens with an excerpt from the Bible (Luke 2:1-20) describing the birth of Christ.  There is also an accompanying CD that features several selections, including the title song, by the Boys Choir of Harlem.  Children have the opportunity to absorb the subtle richness of the artwork and read the lyrics to the songs, all while listening to the young and very talented choir.<br /><br />This book a wonderful way to remind children that Christmas is not a commercial event, rather a spiritual one.  O HOLY NIGHT doesn't present anything new, but instead breathes new life into the story of Christ's birth and classic Christmas Carols.  The combination of Faith Ringgold's fabulous artwork, the melodic voices of The Boys Choir of Harlem, and a deeply moving song, result in an enjoyable multi-sensory experience.  Furthermore, it is a valuable tool parents can use to teach their children about the true meaning of Christmas.  I plan to incorporate this book into my regular holiday traditions.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Power of the Drum	LI'L DAN, THE DRUMMER BOY is a story about a young boy who uses his special talents to save a company of Union soldiers.  Dan learned to play the drum as a result of a lot of perseverance and lessons from a slave who lived on the same plantation.  One day, he runs into a group of Union soldiers who explain that he and all other slaves are now free.  Later, when the company runs into some Confederate soldiers, Dan uses quick thinking and his drum to try and save the day.<br /><br />LI'L DAN, THE DRUMMER BOY is not just a pleasant and educational children's book, but also an important addition to African-American literary history.  The book is the only children's book written and illustrated by the renowned artist, Romare Bearden.  The illustrations in the book reflect his trademark artistic style, and as a result, the book not only sheds light on the Civil War era but is an excellent introduction to an important African-American artist.<br /><br />The book also includes an audio CD which features Maya Angelou reading the story aloud.  While her performance is not breathtaking, it does allow children to either read along or follow along with the illustrations as she reads.  Overall, this is a wonderfully packaged piece of children's literature.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
Evil Among Us	Professor Robert Langdon, a world famous symbologist, is often called upon for his expertise in reading religious symbols and signs. Ironically, for someone so versed in interpreting biblical symbols, he is not a religious man. When a well-known physicist/priest is murdered, Professor Langdon is forced to travel out of his comfort zone to assist in solving the crime.<br /><br />Initially, the murder is thought to be a random act of violence, but the large quantity of blood suggests something more. Further investigation reveals a plot against the Catholic Church by an ancient radical group known as Illuminati. Threatening the very core of the Church leadership, the Illuminati use a scientific breakthrough that will endanger not only the Church, but millions of innocent lives. Will Professor Langdon be able to thwart the intentions of this fanatical brotherhood?<br /><br />ANGELS & DEMONS by Dan Brown is an example of what every great mystery should be. There are elements of suspense, terror, adventure, and surprise. Just when you think you have everything figured out, you are thrown for a loop. As a reader, I was completely engrossed in this story and did not want it to end. I highly recommend ANGELS & DEMONS to those who are looking to learn a little history about symbolic interpretations and to read a great mystery at the same time.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

The Sweetest Reward	Have you ever heard of Michele Hoskins or her company Michele Foods?  If not, make a mental note because she is definitely an African-American businesswoman worth keeping on the radar.  In her book, SWEET EXPECTATIONS, she shares not only her recipe for professional success but also her life journey.  She frankly shares her successes as well as her mistakes both in business and in life.<br /><br />At the book's opening, Michele is in an unfulfilling yet materially comfortable marriage and she wants to make major changes in her life. She eventually divorces, abandoning a life of relative comfort and trading it for one of a struggling single parent.  She sells her home and moves herself and her daughters to her mother's home.  At her lowest point she was even a welfare recipient.  During this time, Michele begins to consider what her long-term career goals should be and eventually decides to go into business selling syrup based on a cherished family recipe.  The recipe, a closely guarded family secret, has been passed down through the generations to a few select descendants and not all of her family is pleased that she plans to market it.  This becomes the source of difficulty for Michele, and in addition, she encounters problems due to her lack of knowledge about business.  In spite of the difficulties, after years of struggle, Michele Hoskins eventually transitions from an unhappy wife, to a divorced welfare mom and eventually to the position of CEO of her very own multi-million dollar company.<br /><br />The book highlights her experiences, expounds business advice, provides inspirational quotes, and offers advice on living.  There are a few dry moments, but all in all this is a truly inspiring book that reminds readers that setbacks do not have to keep them from achieving their dreams.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14
A battle for a child.	Cory Jacobs has just returned to Ann Arbor, Michigan to become a father to his son Cory Jr., whom he has not seen in four years. Realizing the mistakes he made in the past, Cory wants to put all the negativity and hurt from his first marriage behind him. Finally, he is ready to reach out to his estranged ex-wife Paula, for the sake of little Cory. The first meeting between father and son is a positive one, the two quickly form a loving bond as if no time ever separated them.<br /><br />All is well with the reunion until Paula becomes uncooperative by denying Cory access to his son's social security number for insurance purposes. Cory then begins to suspect that Paula may be up to something unsavory regarding Cory and government funds; further investigation proves his theory correct. Paula soon becomes enraged upon learning that Cory is happily remarried and no longer wants a relationship with her.  For spite, she begins to deny Cory his visitation rights. Heartbroken and frustrated, Cory tries to gain access to his son, only to have Paula sabotaging his efforts every step of the way. Leaving him no other choice, Cory must seek custodial rights through the courts, prompting even more hateful antics from Paula.<br /><br />FATHERS HAVE RIGHTS TOO by Robert G. Lockhart had the potential to be a good novel regarding the trials and tribulations that fathers endure when battling for parental rights. However, there were some distracting aspects of the novel. The dialogue between the characters was stiff and at times didn't seem to flow naturally. The characters could have been developed a bit more as well, they seemed too one dimensional. I would have loved to have read more in depth details about what drove Cory. What truly drove him to seek a relationship with his son after all that time had passed? And why was he so willing to take care of another woman's children when he had no interaction with his own? Paula seemed to be just a stereotypical vengeful woman. It would have been interesting reading if we were given more information into her thoughts and her life.<br /><br />Characters also seemed to pop up out of nowhere, like the character of Cory's daughter by a third woman. There was no mention of her or her mother until mid novel when she came over for a visit. Disappointingly, the great court battle was anything but great, it lacked any kind of excitement. A novel regarding a father's legal battles could have used a heartfelt court scene. The novel was in need of an editor. There were mistakes in sentence structure, and there were some sentences with a missing word here and there. Throughout the novel, one sentence would end and the very next one would put you in a different time and place without warning causing the reader to pause and reread for clarity.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

History Revisited	EBONY RISING is a preeminent collection of short fiction written during the Harlem Renaissance Era.  What makes this book stand out from other anthologies with similar subject matter is that the book features a well-planned organizational structure and includes many lesser known writers and works.  Beginning with the preface, editor Craig Gable showcases his breadth of knowledge of the era and it is clear that this book will not only be good reading, but also educational.<br /><br />The selections are organized by the year of publication, with each year (or group of years) serving as its own section.  At the beginning of each section a timeline of significant historical events and African-American literary accomplishments is included to help readers get a sense of the times in which the writings were published.  In addition to including writers often omitted from anthologies, such as Eloise Bibb Thompson, and J. Saunders Redding, the collection has a good balance between male and female featured authors.  At the end of the book there is a detailed listing of sources for further reading, brief biographic sketches of the featured authors, and a handy chart that highlights many of the major themes in the included works.<br /><br />EBONY RISING is one of the best anthologies I have read.  With clear organization, a unique selection of authors, and the inclusion of historical information, this book is a must-have for anyone interested in literature, particularly those with an interest in African-American literature or the Harlem Renaissance.  This book is a refreshing yet educational treat.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-14

G, as he is called, is the owner of a nightclub called G-Spot, where patrons pay $1,000 just to enter the door.  Once inside<br /><br />they can partake of a number of illicit activities, for an extra fee, that include: drinking, drugs, lap dances, and sex.  When Juicy, who was a virgin before she met G, gets a little taste of sexual freedom, she seeks fulfillment in the arms of G's son, Gino.  She feels guilty because G has been taking care of her and her brother since their grandmother's death.<br /><br />Gino is just the opposite of his mean-spirited and domineering father, and Juicy feels safe and protected with him.  When G finds out about their little sexcapades, he makes it known that one of them has to die.<br /><br />Filled with quite a few explicit sex scenes, G-SPOT lives up to its name.  Some of G's actions where a little far fetched and I found myself asking could this really happen. After pondering over that question for a mere second, I soon realized that by my not being privy to this particular lifestyle, anything is possible.

An Intimate Look	Many have enjoyed the lyrical stylings of R&B songbird Alicia Keys, making her a Diamond Disc recording artist.  Reaching such an accomplishment in the music industry, an artist has earned the love and attention of a large fan base.  In return, Alicia has given those fans an intimate look at her innermost thoughts and feelings through her poetry in TEARS FOR WATER.<br /><br />The intimate collection displays her feelings of loneliness and confusion on her road to stardom, and her feelings against social injustice, something that she has witnessed firsthand and read about in history books.  She also writes of her world travels, places that her voice has taken her and the beauty she has discovered while there.  After certain selections Alicia has notes giving her motivation for the written piece, which I found engaging.<br /><br /> I enjoyed the collection because it gave me a closer, more endearing look at the person and not just the artist.  I was disappointed in the collection because it did not hold as much depth as her musical lyrics, which is what made me a fan in the first place.  I expected her poetry to touch me as her songs have, but they fell short.  I felt that she only scratched the surface of what she is really capable of producing, which is why I will continue to support her endeavors.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12

Although Bernard had a different mother, they all shared the same bond: abandonment.  As fate would have it, \\"Street\\" Jamieson and his wife are killed in a car crash.  Although the boys were happy about it, someone else is grieving not only the loss of his mother, but also the loss of a father who has been by his side from the beginning.<br /><br />Sammie Jamieson is thrown into a world of devastation after the loss of his parents.  Having nowhere else to go, he is forced to live with his aunt, who is a known drug addict.  Ironically, he is introduced to the overseer of the Boys and Girls Club: Terrance.  As the two become closer, Sammie is overwhelmed by Terrance's admission of hatred for his father, not realizing that the two men were one and the same.<br /><br />This story was very confusing and detached at first.  It moved very slow but picked up speed toward the ending, where it got really good.  There were some questions that lingered, which gives the reader reason to wonder why certain situations even came up.  A realistic story, SINS OF THE FATHER is one that many people can relate to, but needs a little bit of work.  (RAW Rating: 2.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by T.

Married but Still Curious	Today, living on the down low, or DL, has become a very common discussion thread among all members of society.  What once was something whispered about in closed settings is now discussed openly.  This phenomenon has been brought about by the introduction of many books on the subject.  The fact still remains, men who lead double lives continue to put their partners at risk, when they fail to be honest about their nefarious involvement with other men.  In RECONCILABLE SACRIFICES, Ken Jackson continues the story from Colorful Matters about Keir McBride's step into the duplicitous life of being bi-sexual and married, but not admitting it.<br /><br />Keir McBride's life is a quagmire of deception that soon begins to unravel in his marriage to Tia.  His wife is a wonderful, loving woman; yet, he continues to secretly yearn for a man.  Troy Bevies is one man that Keir cannot seem to rid his subconscience of.  From a sexual encounter one night, Troy develops feelings of love that threaten to break up Keir's happy home and reveal all to Tia, who is beginning to have some doubts of her own.  Keir, on the other hand, unwilling to admit his feelings and accept the fact that he has gay tendencies, will do anything to keep his life with Tia in tact.  What happens when Troy pushes Keir beyond his limits in his desire to have a relationship?  Will Keir become acquiescent and divulge his feelings as well? Or, will he choose to stick with his marriage and life?<br /><br />Ken Jackson has written a very straigthforward account of living on the DL.  He covers an array of issues and emotions in this novel. At the heart of this novel is one man that is married but still dealing with his curiosity with other men.  Deception is not an easy thing to keep up and the author easily navigated through the choices that one would encounter if faced with the choices made by the main character.  I did feel that the author left his readership hanging with a very abrupt ending, as I was more interested in what would happen in his heterosexual relationship with his wife.  My heart cried out for her to follow her intuition and not remain encased in ignorance. Although this is a stand-alone novel, I suggest reading Colorful Matters first to get the background information.  I found that I wanted to know more past information on Keir and his choices in life, which this novel did not cover well.

Consequences	It is a pretty well known truth that honesty and openness are two emotional needs conducive to a successful relationship.  Despite this, most contemporary relationships are plagued by dishonesty and infidelity; two of the most destructive elements to relationship building.<br /><br />LOVE'S GAME explores this trend as it relates the story of Terry, Jeff and Tyrelle; three extremely attractive men with dynamic personalities, who own and operate a nightclub.  It goes without saying that they are very popular with their female clientele and have no problem picking up women. The trio have something else in common. They have each cheated on their mates on numerous occasions.  But there is a twist to this story.  After years of this counterproductive behavior, they have each decided to take their relationship to the next level by coming clean with their significant other about their past indiscretions.  Will their partners be able to let bygones be bygones and forgive them their transgressions?  Will their relationships survive their need to purge?<br /><br />LOVE'S GAME is a book which explores the reality of ethical egoism in relationships. Is it really a virtue for one partner to salve their conscience at the expense of the shattered dreams and broken heart of the other?  Harold Turley does a commendable job in telling each man's story as he attempts to navigate his unique route to self absolution.  The plot is somewhat predictable and the story ended a bit abruptly, but this is a fascinating read with good characters nonetheless.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-01-12
The Phenomenon of Hip Hop	Wow! Where do I begin?  Being several generations removed from<br /><br />the hip-hop scene, I've never afforded myself the opportunity<br /><br />to appreciate or even understand the genre. With mild trepidation<br /><br />I began reading EXPLICIT CONTENT, the story of two young ladies<br /><br />from the Bronx with mad aspiration to become major hip-hoppers.<br /><br />Cassandra Rivers and Leila Aponte fought their way into a<br /><br />friendship and parlayed that friendship into a hip-hop duo known<br /><br />as Sabrina Steelo and Fatal Beauty. But, when G-Double-D, the CEO<br /><br />of the gangsta rap label, Explicit Content, seduces Leila with<br /><br />promises of solo stardom, she falls for it hook, verse, and sample<br /><br />and leaves Cassie hanging. Cassie swallows the hurt from Leila's<br /><br />betrayal and goes solo herself; after all she is the one with<br /><br />the skills. In a short time, Cassie's determination captures the<br /><br />attention of Double-D and he offers her a recording deal. Cassie<br /><br />has to decide how much she is willing to risk for stardom; Double-D<br /><br />has secrets, big secrets, and Leila is in danger. In spite of the<br /><br />tension between them, Cassie is worried about Leila, but she doesn't<br /><br />want to jeopradize her own career or get caught in the middle of<br /><br />Explicit Content's drama.<br /><br />Black Artemis, a hip-hop activist, writer and speaker has penned<br /><br />more than a story about rappers. She has written a bonafide,<br /><br />unpretentious classic about the lives of a generation caught in<br /><br />a musical upheaval. This is an intense story about friendship,<br /><br />loyalty, and the too high price to `make it'. The writing is<br /><br />frank, hip and genuine; Ms. Artemis does not gloss over any aspect<br /><br />of the music, the genre, or the people. About half-way through the<br /><br />book, I started to understand the use of a jargon and the need for<br /><br />an attitude exclusive to the craft. I walked away from EXPLICIT<br /><br />CONTENT with a different awareness and yes, even an appreciation<br /><br />for the sub-culture and for the economic aspect surrounding the<br /><br />phenomenon of HIP-HOP. This is a mad introduction for a first<br /><br />published book.  (RAWSISTAZ Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers>an attitude exclusive to the craft.

Tie a yellow ribbon...	Someone in Chicago is killing women. After beating, raping and finally strangling them, the person ties a yellow ribbon around their necks, thus the killings are dubbed 'The Yellow Ribbon murders.' Just as suddenly as the murders started, they ceased. The deputy mayor's daughter is the last young woman to be murdered, and for years after her death, this particular serial killer is not heard from. Without enough clues and no eyewitnesses, the murders go unresolved. Then a low life drug abuser is arrested and attempts to make a deal with the police - if they won't send him to prison for life, he'll tell them what he knows about the murders. Unfortunately, he ends up getting killed in jail, but Police Lieutenant Quinton Marks is on the job and he begins to investigate everyone who knew the drug abuser.<br /><br />With twist and turns, false leads and clues that lead nowhere, D.A. Cross takes us on a wild ride through the past and into the present with Quinton Marks as he searches from Illinois to Texas to Mexico for the murderer. No clue is too small for him to check. His hunt takes him into territory that is personally dangerous for him. As we learn more about the characters involved, there are several surprises that kept my interest in this rather lengthy mystery. It was a superb story of intrigue and politics; however, I felt at times there were too many details about the lives of some of the people involved. While it helped to know about their past lives, it tended to slow the novel down just a bit. Still, for mystery lovers, it's a great read.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-01-12
Musings	Drawing on the often clever observations of the author, a freelance sportswriter, I GOT JOKES AND ANECDOTES covers a  wide range of topics including fake British accents, cell phones, why celebrities go broke while members of their entourage prosper,  movie awards, football and diets.  In an installment aptly titled \\"hypocrites,\\"  the author muses on the absurdity of the situation when the church is the preacher's only source of income and the preacher drives a Mercedes.  He also comments on people with \\"crusty feet\\" explaining why they should not wear sandals.  With it's variety of topics, the book, while not laugh out loud funny has something for everyone.  The author does an admirable job in getting his point across without the use of crude or offensive language.<br /><br />I GOT JOKES AND ANECDOTES is a quick, easy and entertaining read which showcases the authors unique ability to find humor in the mundane.  While it is not a hysterically funny book, it is guaranteed to bring a smile if not a chuckle or two to your day.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12
Count Your Blessings	Toni Calmeyn does a wonderful job of giving children the opportunity to count their blessings and realize that blessings reside in everything we have, and in everything we do.  Using the numbers one through ten, Allie the Angel gives insight on family, friends, health, life, love, home, new beginnings, a sense of humor, parents and special blessings.<br /><br />Brilliant illustrations also help Allie the Angel hold the interest of little readers.  The end of the book stops at number ten, allowing the person to think about and write what they think their very own special blessing is.  Concluding, each point is summarized again through short vocabulary words, which will help the child spell and sound out the words again; a very effective reading tool.<br /><br />ALLIE THE ANGEL: Blessings from Heaven is inspirational learning for children and adults!  We could all use reminders from time to time.  It definitely teaches us to look at the little things in life - they count too...<br /><br />Reviewed by T.

Life in the 'good ol' days'	Did you ever wonder what it was like for a young black girl growing up in Jim Crow America? Well, wonder no more because AS THE BUTTERBEANS BOIL brings it home with humor along with childlike wonder as young Jayme is introduced to life in a world where whites and blacks live separate existences. Using the combination of a journal, recipes and poetry, Jayme Washington Smalley introduces us to her world on Wooten Road. Her grandmother said they were poor but Jayme didn't see it that way; they had all they could eat, clothes to wear and they had love and friendships - what more could they want or better yet, what were they missing?<br /><br />One of the more endearing stories was when Jayme decided she wanted to see if \\"white water\\" tasted different than \\"colored water\\" so she waited in the department store until no one was looking and she sneaked up to drink from the \\"white\\" water fountain. She didn't get caught but she spent a sleepless night wondering if she would die from drinking \\"white water\\" or if she would turn white during the night. You could feel her relief when she actually woke up the next morning and then looked into the mirror and found herself still black.<br /><br />Jayme Washington Smalley has penned a book that will have you laughing out loud at the beauty and innocence of the young, dancing along with the church folks as they get the Holy Spirit on a Sunday morning, riding in terror with her granddad at the wheel of their old car as it trembles and lurches down country roads and wondering what on earth made America so sick as to separate its people with such carefully drawn lines. Not a big fan of poetry, I still found myself caught up in the rhythms of her rhymes, rocking along with the story that was being told. Her telling of this story was simple and childlike, yet engrossing at the same time. I would recommend this book as a delightful read for all ages.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12
Miss Independence	Alyssa Knight has a lucrative career and is engaged to be married to one of London's moneyed elite, when she suddenly decides to leave it all behind and return home to Chicago.  Haunted by the memory of her best friend's death in a hit-and-run accident, she hopes to find the perpetrator and bring them to justice. While meeting with a friend at the courthouse, she runs into Nathan Hughes, a childhood crush, who is now enjoying a distinguished judicial career and is a likely nominee to the federal bench.<br /><br />Judge Nathan Hughes is very pleased about Allyssa's return to Chicago.  He is at the juncture of his life where he desires to have a family and settle down and finds he is still deeply attracted to her.  Nathan would love nothing better than to have Alyssa as his wife, and mother of his children. Alyssa, on the other hand finds that though she has strong feelings for Nathan, she values her independence and prefers an uncommitted relationship.  Will Nathan be able to wear down Alyssa's resolve to stay single?  Will Alyssa be able to unshroud the mystery surrounding her friend's untimely demise and commit to a relationship with Nathan.<br /><br />BY INTENT is an enchanting love story with appealing characters.  The attraction between the two lovers is certainly palpable and leaves no doubt that Angela Weaver is a creative writer with a flair for storytelling. The one troubling aspect of the story is that the plot unfolds at an excruciatingly slow pace, bordering on tedium.  This, however, could be the author's ploy to allow the reader to savor this alluring love story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-01-12
Our time...has it come yet?	Have you ever read a book that touched you so deeply, and days later you find yourself still thinking about the experience?  Its hold is so magnetic that simple every day actions draw you back to the book even more. OUR TIME HAS COME is that kind of book and its timing is incredible.  It focuses on why our rights are so important, why we as African Americans must continue to fight for them, and why we can't afford to become lackadaisical about them.<br /><br />This story is about three generations of the Chambers family.  The chronology begins with Alexander and Annie Mae Chambers who realized the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation was not enough to give colored families complete freedom and equality.  Alexander believed that more needed to be done in the area of civil rights and that his son, Isaiah, would continue to carry the torch to help their family overcome the manacles of slavery.  Isaiah would marry Orabell and after being chased out of Mississippi, would become a well-known activist for human rights. He continued the legacy left by his father believing that all men are created equal and fighting for that belief to the end.  Unfortunately, his life was cut short and he never got a chance to see his son, Solomon.<br /><br />Orabell gave Solomon the best of everything; the only thing she couldn't give him was the same drive and determination that the former Chambers men had.  Solomon would marry Sunshine and struggle with understanding the battle for equality.  He would in fact struggle with this battle until 2007 when he would have to step up to the plate to save the nation and his race from self-destruction.<br /><br />Sylvester Stephens has written a very powerful and moving account of being black in America and just how close we are to losing our rights if we're not careful.  Each character was so delicately woven into the fabric of this book that I came away feeling like a very close relative.  Using each of the main characters, he traced the fight for freedom from the turbulent years following the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, through the chaotic times of the civil rights movement of the 60's and 70's, and through the fictitious maneuvering of the political scene of the future.<br /><br />Although this was a work of fiction, it made me sit up and think about how precious freedom is.  Considering the election in our country this year, this is a timely and well-engineered book, and should be a wake up call to Black America.  Everything may not be as guaranteed as we think.  It would be a shame for our time to come and go and we not realize it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely be adding Mr. Stephens to my list of authors to read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

I'm hot!	Imagine the stress and fear that assails a perfectly healthy vegetarian who exercises and does everything right when she is suddenly attacked by strange body pain, waves of heat followed by icy chills and mood swings that threaten everyone around her. Then there is the loss of libido in a woman who has enjoyed sex with the best of them. Suddenly, she is no longer interested and doesn't want to be bothered by her husband. This was Rashida Aisha Ali's introduction to menopause; or a pause from men as she puts it, exactly as the name implies. She takes us through her rollercoaster journey of Hormone Replacement Therapy back to the natural remedies. Ms. Ali lets us in on her most intimate thoughts and feelings as she attempts to survive the ups and downs of a situation that seems to be forbidden to discuss. And think about it: did your mother tell you anything at all about menopause? Or do women brush by it as if it doesn't happen?<br /><br />In a delightful, informative manner, Ms. Ali gives all the gory details of the change of life for women of a certain age. In addition, she includes the wonderful changes that also occur in the midst of physical and mental turmoil. I got a little confused a couple of times regarding the sequence of events but in spite of that, it explains so well the inner rage and shock that women feel after they've told themselves it will never happen to them; they will never lose their libido - that's for others. It is an excellent read for those who have not yet reached this \\"certain age\\" and want to know what to expect.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12
Going Organic	TRANSITION INTO ORGANIC FOODS is predicated on the belief that a diet grounded in organic foods is essential in helping the body's defenses ward off disease and promote optimal health. The author makes a good argument for switching to organic foods by explaining how conventional foods are grown in soil laced with pesticides and other detrimental chemicals.  Organic crops on the other hand are grown in a chemical free environment and livestock are treated humanely and raised without chemical or hormonal enhancements.  She points out that if livestock is treated with antibiotics the meat is no longer considered organic.<br /><br />TRANSITION INTO ORGANIC FOODS explains that there is also a difference between organic versus natural foods and as a bonus includes the author's favorite recipe for organic oatmeal cookies.  A grocery list is included to help the reader see the variety of organic food choices available and resources are also provided to help locate organic food markets. The book concludes with a survey which encourages readers to try out different organic fruits and rate them.<br /><br />TRANSITION INTO ORGANIC FOODS is a compelling fact-based read which is written in a simple, easy to understand format, that guides the reader<br /><br />to a better understanding of the basic differences between conventional, organic and natural foods.  With its decidedly appetizing cover design, this book is best suited for readers interested in changing their eating habits.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12
From Nuptials to Super Sleuth	On the heels of her first novel, Promises Beyond Jordan, Vanessa Davis Griggs has written a sequel that promises to be a big hit in the Christian Fiction genre.  In WINGS OF GRACE, readers are once again pulled into the magnetic life of Pastor George Landris several months after his break up with Theresa Jordan.  Pastor Landris is now engaged to Johnnie Mae Taylor and there is a whole host of new characters to enjoy.<br /><br />Johnnie Mae is a novelist who has embarked upon a great mystery she finds in an elderly woman named Sarah Fleming who appears to be in need of a savior.  Pastor Landris is still the Pastor of Wings of Grace Faith Ministry Church in Birmingham, Alabama. He learns from some of his parishioners that despite all his biblical teachings, there are still those in the church who are caught up in tradition and a battle is brewing that may mean his pastorship is at risk. As they prepare to spend a lifetime together, will outside forces intervene?<br /><br />At the same time, Theresa is preparing for the birth of her child, while she works diligently on a relationship with her mother, Lena Patterson.  But a long, lost relative appears on the scene with some less than savory intentions that may threaten their relationship.<br /><br />Each of the subplots converges into one good mystery with a few breath holding twists, as Johnnie Mae and Pastor Landris prepare for their nuptials. Vanessa Davis Griggs writes a magnificent mystery woven around a very tender love story that embedded many biblical lessons.  She includes a bible verse at the beginning of each chapter.  Whether intended or not, I found that the chapters each provides a more fruitful understanding of each verse.  I was absorbed with the way she incorporated the lessons of faith, love, forgiveness and family within this novel alongside a cast of unforgettable characters.

When High Society Goes Ghetto	Having things can bring a lot of happiness to one's life.  But, when possessing those things becomes an obsession it can be fatal, especially when the object is a person.  Face it, we all know or have heard of women who will stop at nothing to get and keep a man.  They will use manipulation, threats, cheap tricks or anything handy to keep him.  In INSATIABLE by Allison Hobbs, we get a look into a couple of extreme cases of obsession that pave the way for a confrontation with an eyeing-opening conclusion.<br /><br />Terelle Chambers has lived all her life in the ghetto.  She spent a good bit of it in foster homes and learning to fend for herself with no thanks to her mother.  One of the bright spots in her life was her man, a philandering drug dealer named Marquise.  He, unfortunately, landed in prison doing time on drug charges.  Terelle then found herself pregnant with his child and living with her grandmother.  As she waits on him, her dream is that they will eventually build a happy family life together, despite the advice of her best friend and relatives.  How far will she go to keep the dream together?<br /><br />Terrell's total opposite is Kai Montgomery.  Born the product of an interracial relationship, Kai is adopted by the Montgomery's, an affluent Caucasian couple.  In an effort to provide a good life for Kai, they gave her everything. Outsmarted and rejected by a former lover, Kai resorts to some unbelievable and dangerous antics to help quench her abnormal sexual appetite.  After one of her rendezvous lands her with a very sexy thug from the hood, she is hooked and vows to let nothing or no one come between them.  Is she really ready to take her game to the ghetto?<br /><br />Allison Hobbs has written one electrifying and devilishly delicious tale about obsession at its worst, one where two women from very different worlds vie for the same man despite decency and common sense. I was riveted by this book until the wee hours of the morning, refusing to put it down.  The two women's obsessions with one man gave me chills, but it was oh so real.  I had to shake my head in disbelief a few times at the things they did in the name of love or `good' sex.  When the two worlds collided, the outcome was stellar and very unimaginable.  I even found the secondary characters just as engaging and memorable as the main ones.  Ms. Hobbs, you did your thing in this one.

Girl Power	This book delved into so much within its pages that it is difficult to create a decent summary that would do the entire book justice and cover everything.  The story begins very slowly at first, creeping at a pace that aggravated me.  However, when I finally realized the author's intent, I was amazed at the wonderful story that emerged.  Cline took her time to craft a unique cast of characters that laid the framework for a magnificent tale.  I realized that the girls and the boys represented two different factions in the book.<br /><br />From the Seven Sisters we learn about the struggle for women's rights, how to treat all people as racial equals and how to give complete loving acceptance despite the person creed, race, or circumstance.  The young men, on the other hand, taught separateness by race and gender, prejudice against all that were different from them and a deep hatred that could destroy all of them.  As the dogma of the two factions clashed in this novel, each of the young women came into her own. Each of their stories, though hard to bear at times, was fascinating.  Girl power is indeed a beautiful thing.  Sandra Cline is a very gifted storyteller and I am looking to more from this author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

True Crimes	DUTCH: THE FIRST OF A TRILOGY is a bone-chilling tale of murder, power and retribution, which vividly highlights the crime riddled existence of notorious Newark gangster, Bernard James, AKA Dutch.<br /><br />Dutch's life of crime begins at about the age of 14, when he cunningly capitalizes on a botched robbery attempt against a business owner with close ties to the mob. Dutch cold-heartedly tricks and kills the would be perpetrator, to the shocked relief of the mobster and then calmly disposes of the body.  Appreciative, he soon introduces Dutch to \\"Fat Tony\\", a reputed mob boss, who is so impressed by Dutch's heinous act that he takes him under his protection and rewards him with a coveted connection to a \\"chop shop,\\" which only dealt in luxury cars.  Thus began Dutch's criminal legacy, which grows to gigantic proportions and culminates in his being put on trial for a murderous rampage labeled \\"the month of murder.\\"  The District Attorney appears to have an airtight case, which does not bode well for Dutch.  But an ever resourceful Dutch has no plans to live his life in prison and quickly orchestrates a plan to avenge those who would dare to attempt to usurp his meteoric rise to the top.<br /><br />DUTCH: THE FIRST OF A TRILOGY is a fast moving story with ruthless dialogue and a plot that goes into detail after gory detail of  Dutch's bizarre life of crime.  This thoroughly absorbing and harrowing tale reads like a work of fiction and is one that will keep any lover of this genre captivated.

Thirsty For More	DARK THIRST is a very eclectic mix of  the increasingly popular genre of vampire lore.  Noted authors, Donna Hill, Monica Jackson and Omar Tyree, have stepped out of their respective genres to pen the odd mix of science fiction which include threads of romance, comedy and urban fiction.<br /><br />The most memorable of the six short stories is Monica Jackson's 'The Ultimate Diet'.  The storyline is hilarious from beginning to end.  I volleyed between laughing out loud and pure shock.  The main character Keeshia wants to lose weight and become as sultry as her mysterious neighbor, without the hard work of diet and exercise.  When she finds out her neighbor's secret, she will stop at nothing to achieve the image she so covets.<br /><br />Donna Hill's 'The Touch' is a dangerously sensuous tale of a vampire looking for her one true love.  Selena has learned that sexual release can keep her bloodlust at bay, but not for long.  She must find the one man who can put her fire out and keep it out.  I enjoyed the romantic twist to the typically bloodthirsty vampire story.<br /><br />Kevin S. Brokenbrough takes it to the streets in 'The Family Business'.  A street punk abuses his wife and son and is dealt with in the most heinous fashion for the pain he has caused them. Shelly has a family secret that allows her to fight back when she can no longer take the abuse.  At times this story was so out of the ordinary, even for science fiction, I would question what is going on here, but I could not stop reading.  I had to know what happened next<br /><br />Three memorable stories out of six is not bad, but it averages out to be just that, average. The three remaining short stories did not give me the same emotional response to reading them as the one's mentioned above; they were decent, but not memorable.  All together it was a great effort, but not great enough to be ranked amongst the best in the genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersReviewers	2005-01-12

The past is closer than you think	In the THREE SEEDS OF EVE, we meet three women who are strangers to each other until a chance meeting at the annual Taste of Chicago Festival.  They find themselves together in the tent of Madame Clara, a well-known psychic.  A feeling of familiarity overcomes all three as they prepare to listen to Madame Clara.  The psychic gives them a very ominous prediction for their future that would transpire in a year's time.  She tells them that in ancient times each was once a great queen and their past ancestors are trying to reclaim what was once lost to them.  As their pasts revive, they each will suffer grave danger. Each of them dismisses the warning and the psychic, going their separate ways.<br /><br />Estelle is a registered nurse at the Franklin Waldens Medical Center.  She stumbles on an embezzlement scheme in the medical center that puts her in a menacing circumstance.  Brianne-Subria has it all.  She is married to a police captain who adores the ground she walks on.  She has a beautiful home, nice car, and designer clothes.  It appears that God has richly blessed her, but she still isn't happy.  In her search for happiness, she becomes a betrayer.  Jessica is an unemployed housewife.  She believes every man wants her and every woman is jealous of her.  She thinks nothing of going outside the marriage to quench her insatiable sexual appetite.<br /><br />Grant Lewis, Jr. spins an exciting web of deceit, treachery and doom for all three of the main characters in the THREE SEEDS OF EVE.  He ties the current life of each woman to a biblical ancestor. Seeing how each of their lives unfolded was amazing.  At one point it actually seemed as the past had become the present and I was reading a story from the Bible that had been adapted for today.  I really like how Lewis weaved the ancient and modern times together to show how greed, lust and lies can manifest themselves in our lives.

Tell the truth!	All of us sometimes have revolutionary thoughts about what goes on around us, but how many of us have what it takes to say it aloud? Well, Waset does. She takes on the US administration for its unprovoked attack on Iraq and the thousands of people who are dying for one man's desires. How many of us have been frustrated at a fast food drive-up window? With wit and humor, Waset lets us know exactly how she feels and what she wants to say to those people who are so dense that they can't get a hamburger order straight. Black businesses that hire dumb people, black businessmen who don't pay good wages, thugs who rob and terrorize those who are doing right are covered. Relationships between black men and women are not taboo either. While she doesn't blame only men or only women or say that ignorant rap music is the cause, she takes all three to task for their part in the issues. Why do black men write those words? Why do black women listen to them? Why do white radio stations play them? Through it all, she reminds us that we are kings and queens and we need to live up to being kings and queens.<br /><br />Using a combination of journal entries, poetry and essays, Waset covers every facet of black people living in a country where they have never been welcomed. It is an easy to read book because her style is such that you can imagine yourself sitting across from her having a drink as she gives you her very own personal views on the world. I frequently found myself laughing out loud. Her thoughts are revolutionary and much needed in a world where black people have come to believe what the mass media says about them rather than what they know to be true. With a kick and a laugh, she urges us to try harder, to be better people, to be the best we can be. It is a must read for all age groups.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-01-12
Small but Packs a Punch...	LOVE LINKS is one of those books that although it is small in size, the message within packs a big punch.  As stated on the back cover of this novel, the story pulls at your heartstrings and lifts your spirits as well.  Chaunte and Sylvester Burns have a wonderful life with their newly adopted daughter, Crystal, and their nanny, Chitara.  One cold night all their lives change in an instant.  Crystal becomes severely ill and is rushed to the hospital.  She is diagnosed with AIDS and that catapults the family into near devastation.  Eventually, her diagnosis will not only bring them closer together, but have far-reaching effects on others as well.<br /><br />Jeanne C. White has written a very compelling story on the AIDS epidemic and where its impact is felt the most. She managed to pull me into the lives of the main characters in a very short period of time by completely captivating me with their story and the situation they were living with.  AIDS has become that dirty little disease that everybody tries to push aside, when actually it is becoming so very prevalent in our society.  It is affecting the lives of not only adults, but also children born with the disease, and there is no one to care for them. Ms. White has helped to bring much awareness to their plight.  Other than a few typesetting errors, my only beef with this book was its brevity.  LOVE LINKS is truly a story worth reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The future in the hands of a woman	D. V. Bernard has written a wonderful science fiction piece about the things we hold dear and how they can cause our destruction if we don't learn to appreciate and protect them.  Our genetic makeup is our signature in this world.  In the hands of a madman, a race could be extinguished or our abilities to procreate could be hampered.  Our love for computers and electronic devices could be used as another mechanisim to destroy us by anyone with an evil plan and the resources to do so.<br /><br />Mr. Bernard has boldly stepped into an arena few African-Americans have ventured. This powerfully written novel was truly an eye-opening experience.  The pace and the action kept me enthralled as I tried to figure out the plot.  When I thought I had it figured out, it took another turn that introduced many other possibilities.  The characters were varied and well developed. They each brought a significant addition to the story.  I often found myself wondering how he kept up with each character, each plot and all the intricate details until the end. For all of you science fiction lovers, here is an author you must add to your TBR list.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-01-12
At what price?	Greed.  Such a small word, but one that oftentimes brings out the worst in people, resulting in serious consequences and repercussions.  When football great Anthony Beals decides to marry, he turns a deaf ear to the advice of friends and family who encourage him to look before he leaps into a marriage with someone he has known only a short while.  Even though there are obvious signs his marriage is not a match made in heaven, Anthony is determined to stick it out no matter what.  When his wife leaves him for reasons he can't fathom, Anthony is devastated, so he sets out to win her back, no matter the cost.<br /><br />By giving out some advice to a distraught fan, Lecia Calhoun, a sex therapist and author of The Big O, has unknowingly landed herself smack dab in the middle of the drama between Anthony and his wife Ginger.  When Anthony finds out that Lecia may have had a hand in his wife leaving him, he demands that she talk to his wife on his behalf and make her understand that she may have passed judgment too hastily.  What ensues is a tale of hurtful truths, eye-opening realizations, deceit, duplicity, and of course a little bit of good old fashioned romance.<br /><br />Although GIMME AN O! was a bit predictable, it was interesting to see how the storyline played out.  Not being a person given to greed, unless it's a good book or chocolate, I was amazed at the lengths Ginger went to get what she wanted.  I've been a fan of Perrin's for as long as I can remember, and the more she writes, the better she gets.  She has the ability to create characters and storylines that stick with you long after the last page has been read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12
A Visual Journey	Whenever I make a photograph I try to capture the signature<br /><br />of the Spirit, Unseen, but ever manifesting itself. The Spirit<br /><br />sustains and enriches what is inside every thing. The Spirit<br /><br />informs my daily living.  -- Chester Higgins, Jr.<br /><br />Chester Higgins, New York Times photographer, uses an intimate,<br /><br />moving narrative, brought to life with stunning photographs, to<br /><br />capture and celebrate the most defining qualities of people,<br /><br />places, and events.<br /><br />ECHO of the SPIRIT is Higgins' most personal work to date. The<br /><br />photographs are rich in spirit and memory, and the text is<br /><br />simple but elegant. He focuses on the significant people and<br /><br />events of his own life. Higgins shares his boyhood days as a<br /><br />preacher in New Brockton, Alabama, tells of family members who<br /><br />shaped his life, trips to Ghana, Brazil and Haiti, and pays<br /><br />tribute to his mentors at Look Magazine.<br /><br />Higgins was reared by his mother and stepfather, but was<br /><br />heavily influenced by his grandfather, who wanted him to<br /><br />follow in his footsteps as a minister. After his grandfather's<br /><br />death, Higgins rebuked the idea of preaching the gospel. As<br /><br />such his photographs became the modem he used to speak to the<br /><br />masses. Photography is his tool to discover and acknowledge<br /><br />the echo of the Spirit. But he could not erase his grandfather's<br /><br />influence, the years as a childhood minister illuminate the<br /><br />passion he brings to his photographs.<br /><br />ECHO of the SPIRIT is a remarkable look at a creative life<br /><br />and the cultural history that complimeted it. In a word<br /><br />this book is AWESOME! This is an excellent coffee table book.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-01-12
One man's dream of decency and dignity	Dr. Magnus O. Bassey brings Malcolm X back to life for those who were not fortunate enough to have heard him when he was alive. Malcolm started his life in poverty, saw his father lynched, spent a great deal of time in foster care and finally went to prison, but was able to rise from the rubble and become one of America's foremost leaders. He frequently said pushing for civil rights was not what Afro-Americans should be about, but rather they should be pushing for human rights because then their plight could be brought to the United Nations as well as getting buy-in from African leaders. He wanted to show the world what the mighty, democratic America was doing to her very own citizens.<br /><br />Malcolm started out with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, but after traveling to Mecca and other places outside the United States, he became more interested in worldwide human rights. Even today Malcolm's Organization of Afro-American Unity is real and relative to our times. He outlines how Afro-Americans should organize, what their goals should be and how those goals can be accomplished. It would be so helpful in the ongoing struggle for human rights if more people were familiar with his work.<br /><br />Dr. Bassey has written a concise, informational book that everyone in the country needs to be aware of, in order to set aside some of the myths about the condition of this country and its stand or lack thereof, for human rights. He covered Malcolm's life in an unbiased manner, covering both his good points and those that weren't so good, such as referring to whites as devils early in his career. I found the book to be a wonderful resource for those details you'd like to remember forever but can't. It is a book that I will keep as a reference for information on Malcolm X.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2005-01-12
Secrets and Repercussions	The prologue for IF YOU WALKED IN MY SHOES alerted me that there<br /><br />would be a day of reckoning. Coreen Holmes was raped by one of<br /><br />her classmates when she was seventeen years old, and her die was<br /><br />cast. Thirteen year old Frieda Davis was sexually abused by her<br /><br />adoptive father, a fate which continued for four years; until<br /><br />Frieda fled into the night.<br /><br />A much older Coreen Holmes Treadwell is on the brink of fulfilling<br /><br />her dream as the president of the International Society of Social<br /><br />and Welfare Agency. For the past 29 years she has dedicated her<br /><br />time to social and welfare issues. And for that same period she has<br /><br />lived behind a façade, with the fear that her darkest secret would<br /><br />be unveiled. But how long does a secret remain a secret? Coreen's<br /><br />fear is manifested when her past walks into her present.<br /><br />Frieda needs closure to her past; her adoptive parents are deceased<br /><br />and she needs to know her roots. Also embedded in her heart is the<br /><br />drive to fulfill a vendetta against her biological mother. But will<br /><br />her vindictive intent produce an outcome more devastating than her<br /><br />past?<br /><br />IF YOU WALKED IN MY SHOES is a dramatic story about two women<br /><br />emotionallydamaged by violent acts, and the aftermath that<br /><br />reverberated throughout their lives. The destiny of these women was<br /><br />propelled by outside forces at a time when neither was mature enough<br /><br />to accept the outcome. And while each chose a different way to deal<br /><br />with their past, somehow that difference had an element of sameness.<br /><br />Premature in their judgment about one another, things become clearer<br /><br />when they share the opportunity to walk in each other's shoes. Ms.<br /><br />Forster methodically highlights the emotional anguish of the<br /><br />characters and the havoc the repercussions caused in Coreen and<br /><br />Frieda's lives, yet it is the very havoc that served to strengthened<br /><br />them.

Has God joined it together?	How do you find a mate? And more specifically how do you become a<br /><br />mate? There is no doubt that there is an overabundance of advice<br /><br />on how to accomplish both scenarios. However if you want to truly<br /><br />experience the culmination of this search you cannot listen  to<br /><br />'experts' who shower us with the physical aspects of the conquest,<br /><br />we must adhere to the rules of God. One vow states \\"What God has<br /><br />joined together, let no man put asunder\\", and if wefollow His<br /><br />rules we will be assured that God has indeed joined it together.<br /><br />With candor, frankness and real illustration, HIS RULES explores<br /><br />relationship guidelines, based on the scripture. One of the goals<br /><br />of this book is to prepare readers to get closer to God and clean<br /><br />up their lives in preparation for a blessed union. The blueprint<br /><br />for becoming and attracting a lifelong mate is accomplished in<br /><br />its fullness when God is first in our lives. God has a plan, think<br /><br />about the significance of how woman was created. If we allow God<br /><br />to lead us, when we are joined in holy matrimony, His plan will<br /><br />prevail and each rib will fit.<br /><br />The book is divided into three main sections, Get Dieseled, Get<br /><br />Smart and Get Together. The chapters in each section are<br /><br />subscripted with scriptures, to emphasize the author's message.<br /><br />Again, the intent of the authors is to convey God's relationship<br /><br />principles, which are laid out explicitly in His Word. And also<br /><br />to enlighten couples that the walk down the aisle in not the end,<br /><br />we must follow his rules to infinity.

Lives Collide	Richard Richards met and married the woman of his dreams.  Several miscarriages later, their once dream marriage is hanging on by a thread.  Maxine, Richard's wife, is consumed by the prospect of having a child of her own, so much so that she is teetering the fine line between sanity and insanity.  Because of her mental condition and need for ongoing treatment, she is unable to attend Richard's family reunion in the islands.  Instead, Richard decides to shorten his planned trip and room with his brother Marcus.  While on the vacation, the two brothers meet Basics and Troy, two girlfriends who were in desperate need of a get-away. The foursome quickly pair off, Basics with Richard and Marcus with Troy, and each decide to leave their lives at home far in the back of their minds.  As a result of the trip, Basics and Richard begin developing a special relationship that continues when they return home to Miami.  Despite the undeniable attraction and Richard's unhappiness at home, the two continue to keep their relationship on platonic terms. In the meantime, Maxine continues to spiral out of control and an explosive plot is revealed.<br /><br />My initial reaction to the book was lukewarm at best, but as the story progressed, I found myself wrapped up in the ensuing drama.  The character of Basics seemed inconsistent, she was portrayed as a no-nonsense, strong-minded woman, yet, when she met Richard she was willing to accept her position as the other woman and settled for what she could get in terms of a relationship.  Furthermore, there were a number of superfluous scenes that took away from the overall flow of the story.  Finally, there were a few grammatical errors that I found distracting.  With some additional editorial polishing, A MAN LIKE RICHARD easily has the potential to be a five-star book.

Together Again	In MISSING PIECES, Sherry Cochran shares the deeply personal and often painful experiences of her life.  Her young world was torn apart after she and her siblings were removed from her family and placed in foster care.  One by one, they were either shifted to other foster care placements or adopted, leaving her alone and out of the reach of her protective older siblings.  By the time Sherry was adopted she was mistrustful of all adults, yet hopeful that for once she would have a family that was really hers.  Unfortunately, her adoption dream turned into a nightmare, and she had to endure verbal, psychological and physical abuse at the hands of her adoptive mother.  Eventually, Sherry found herself back in the foster care system even more emotionally battered and bruised.  Throughout her life she held on to the snapshots that represented her memories of her mother and siblings.  Once she was old enough, she began her search for her birth family but encountered numerous brick walls.  Sherry's search for her family was long, frustrating and emotionally trying but eventually she found success and was reunited with family members who for years were only faded memories.<br /><br />MISSING PIECES is a stirring account of both childhood abuse and a search for a birth family.  While I believe that both storylines are important and should be shared with readers, I felt like there were times when they worked against each other. The author switched back and forth between first and third person point of views and explained in the introduction that it was to help readers empathize more with her childhood experiences.  I found the use of third person disassociated the author from the child in the book and I think those chapters would have had more impact from the first person perspective.  In spite of these things, MISSING PIECES is an excellent achievement for Cochran and an important illustration of some of the ills of the foster care and adoption systems.

Inside a Man's Heart	In communicating and trying to figure out what it is men want, sometimes it's necessary to go directly to the source: men!  Michelle McKinney Hammond has done that in her latest book, 101 WAYS TO GET AND KEEP HIS ATTENTION.  She has interviewed 100 men of various ages, races, backgrounds, and socioeconomic status to find out exactly what it is they look for in a woman; especially the one they will make their wife.  Using their answers and her Christian background, Ms. Hammond has created a step-by-step guide for women interested in getting inside a man's heart, while simultaneously making themselves better people.<br /><br />Although the book is spiritually based with scriptures and guidance from God's teachings, it is also broken down into the basics of what most men agree attracts them to women.  Using the five senses as the focus, this book is indeed a repository of information for becoming the woman who not only interests a man, but also one who is pleasing to God.  It's no big secret that men enjoy the physical appearance of women, but 101 WAYS TO GET AND KEEP HIS ATTENTION delves a bit deeper into the man's psyche and shows his vulnerability, his desire for love, affection, gentleness, and to be appreciated.  It further details how our moods, tone, and even touch can make or break his spirit.  As an extra bonus, sprinkled throughout the book are quotes, as well as poems highlighting the beauty of love and sharing that love with another person.<br /><br />Ms. Hammond urges women to look at themselves, open up for revelation and discovery, and change attitudes as necessary to fully reap the benefits.  I enjoyed this book and have incorporated the teachings within my own day-to-day dealings with my husband.  It is a delight to find a read that inspires and motivates, as well as celebrates and encourages the beauty of not only love, but how to be loving.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Testimony	Have you ever wondered if your life made a difference?  Have you ever feared death?  These are the two main themes of Julius Lester's DO LORD REMEMBER ME, a compelling novel in which the main character Reverend Joshua Smith reflects over his life and prepares for his death.  As he struggles to gather enough clarity to prepare his own obituary, he reminisces over his experiences as a child, parent, husband, spiritual leader, and political leader.  He is reminded of his strength as he fights to maintain his dignity in spite of his rapidly declining health.<br /><br />Reverend Smith's life encompassed several historic social eras in United States history.  As a child he grew up around former slaves who had been freed as a result of the Civil War.  He received his call to ministry at a very young age, and as a religious leader, he often found himself amid negotiations to help protect the best interests of blacks while keeping them safe (and alive) through the Jim Crow era.  He was highly respected by both blacks and whites in the community and a much sought after evangelist.  However, the strength of his legacy was weakened as a result of the Civil Rights Era.  His willingness to sacrifice his own dignity for the greater good was then looked upon as weakness, and some relegated him to the position of an Uncle Tom.  He also notes the strained relationship he shares with his sons and acknowledges some of the mistakes he made in their upbringing.<br /><br />DO LORD REMEMBER ME is a story about a man caught between eras.  He is a man of strength and courage even in his weakest moments. As he struggles to prepare his written legacy, I was taken on a journey through history as well as a deeply personal exploration of the main character's life.  Julius Lester has done a wonderful job creating characters I could empathize with, at times bringing me to the brink of tears.  Reverend Joshua Smith is a character I will not soon forget, and I can only hope that when my time comes I can prepare for death with the same strength and dignity he illustrated.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersmes I can prepare for death with the same strength and dignity he illustrated. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2004-12-22
No Regrets	Most of us have heard of John Brown and his unsuccessful raid on Harpers Ferry.  But how many of us have heard of Mary Ellen Pleasant?  Mary Ellen Pleasant was a civil rights leader before there was an official movement, yet she is often omitted from history books.  In FREE ENTERPRISE Michelle Cliff uses a mixture of historical fact and fiction to create a complex tale that highlights the life of this often overlooked phenomenal woman.<br /><br />The book takes place in the mid 1800's and focuses on the lives of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a wealthy hotelier from California, and Annie Christmas, a young Jamaican who left her home to make a life in the United States.  In addition, special attention is paid to the relationship the two women shared and their involvement in the abolitionist movement.  The story is not told in a linear fashion; instead the author takes readers back and forth in time.  In addition, the story is told from through the voices of several different characters in a series of vignettes.  The result is a complex and richly detailed story told with a strong literary flair.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed FREE ENTERPRISE; it is a thought-provoking and enjoyable tale.  It is a weighty read, and requires full attention and thought.  As Michelle Cliff alternates from time to time, place to place, and voice to voice, she provides intricate details that when woven together result in a powerful tale.  I particularly loved the fact that all of the major characters in the book were women, and that the author depicted them as strong, intelligent and well-rounded, especially considering the time period in which the story took place.  FREE ENTERPRISE is a well-written, literary read with strong female characters, and a pleasant mixture of history and creativity.  This is the kind of book you could read several times and each time take something new away; definitely a story to savor.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers<br />	2004-12-22
You Can't Run from the Past	Daddy Cool, Black Girl Lost, Dopefiend -- these and the numerous other works published by Donald Goines brought the streets to the pages of a book.  Goines was most qualified to write about the themes he covered in his books because much of what he wrote about, he lived.  LOW ROAD covers most of his short life, beginning with his childhood, highlighting his family life as well as his less than stellar academic career.  Next his decision to join the military and his military life is discussed.  Goines' military experiences are a critical turning point in his life because it is while enlisted that Goines develops the drug addiction that would haunt him for the rest of his life.  After leaving the military, he returns home with no job prospects and an addiction to support; it is then that he really commits to hustling and quickly gets caught up in life on the streets.<br /><br />As a result of his criminal activity, he eventually finds himself incarcerated, during which time he is exposed to the works of Iceberg Slim and is inspired to write.  Upon his release, Goines was able to secure a series of book deals and was able to achieve a certain degree of success as a writer.  In spite of this, his personal demons continued to have a strong hold and his personal life remained one of frustration, poverty and addiction.  The murders of Goines and his girlfriend remain unsolved to this day, and while there are many theories as to what killed him, most believe the murder was simply his past catching up with him.<br /><br />The author obviously spent a great deal of time and research and the result is a well balanced look at Goines.  Readers will better understand the factors which ultimately led to his self-destructive lifestyle while seeing first hand how success is not always enough to overcome a drug addiction.  Goines' murder resulted in the loss of a talented writer who had the unique ability to bring the grit and realism of the streets to life in an engaging and gripping story.  The fact that his murder remains unsolved and that Goines died virtually penniless and still addicted to heroin adds to the bitter irony of his life.<br /><br />There were times when I felt the book had a bit too much fluff, with the author spending too much time discussing the times rather than Goines himself, I still felt the book was informative and an enjoyable read.  If you are a fan of the writings of Donald Goines or have ever wondered about the man behind the books, then LOW ROAD is a necessary and worthy addition to your reading library.

A Romantic Suspense...	Everyone needs a little romance in their lives to keep things in perspective, and unlike most of the books I've read in the past month, THREE PERFECT MEN took me on a road trip, one in which good men do exist.  Evelyn Palfrey has matched three women with different backgrounds in an unlikely friendship, a glorious setting on a lake in the woods of a small Texas city, and of course the men who come into their lives.  However, Ms. Palfrey didn't stop there, instead she threw in a few extra cards of suspense, mystery, and fun.<br /><br />Eleanor, Angela, and Sondra: a feminist publisher/bookstore owner, computer programmer, and judge, have all taken off from their busy lives in Houston determined to get their minds off the things ailing them, but specifically to lift Angela's spirits regarding her so-called boyfriend.  They've known each other for quite some time and RV trips to various spots across the U.S. is the norm for them.  Unfortunately things start looking down when they find themselves lost.  Not able to find the turn-off on their homemade map, they're a bit weary when a local man offers to show them to their destination.<br /><br />Over the course of a day or so, the calm and peacefulness of the lake is corrupted when a boat washes up to shore, inviting not only fear for their well-being, and doubt from the local sheriff, but also the introduction of two brothers brings a few more surprises to their trip.  The women each allow their personalities to dictate what follows and it's definitely an interesting, intriguing, and sometimes funny scenario of what they get themselves into.  Will they each take a step back to evaluate things and follow the path laid so clearly before them?<br /><br />Reading Ms. Palfrey's work is just as much a delight as talking to her in person.  She's witty, warm, and loving, and it shines through in THREE PERFECT MEN.  The highlight for me was seeing the men and how they allowed themselves to communicate with the women, to grow, and to acknowledge their feelings.  I also enjoyed the suspenseful element of the book as well as the romantic portions.  Her characters, though they have issues, help the reader realize the canvas which many of us paint our lives.  We often use the past to guide the present, even at the sacrifice of turning away from something that could be good for us.  Through these characters, we're able to see that romantic interlude, the \\"courting\\", and the wholesomeness and gentlemanly qualities missing from societal images of relationships. Ms. Palfrey's characters could be any one, of any race, or of any class.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersrow, and to acknowledge their feelings.

A Resource for A Successful Marriage	Ask anyone who has been married for more than a few months and they'll tell you without hesitation how much work it is -- hard work. In the fairytales and movies, the audience is offered images of happily ever after, roses, picket fences and things of this nature.  However, in the real world, it's simply not possible to be this way every single minute of every single day, especially when sharing your life with another person, and one of the opposite sex.<br /><br />Dr. David F. Stephens, a newspaper advice columnist billed as \\"The Relationship Coach\\" has taken questions received from his readers and responds to them using biblical answers which are backed with scriptures and easy to understand terminology.  From questions on communication, to adultery, to dealing with others in your close and extended family, and even covering financial issues, there is a range of scenarios for everyone.  He also covers more intimate things such as getting the romance back in your marriage and offers a guide to aid in getting things back on track.<br /><br />ASK THE MARRIAGE COUNSELOR is a resource for a successful marriage, or even for those considering marriage.  In just the first third of the book, I learned many things I wish I had known, but am grateful to come across them and have the opportunity to share them as well as this book with my husband.  My only issue with the book is the repetitive nature of some of the answers.  While I realize these questions were pulled from actual questions answered in his advice column, some time could've been spent cleaning the entire book to take away some of that repetitiveness, merge questions, and things of this nature.  Fortunately, it doesn't take away from the strength of this book and the recommendation I'd give for all couples to check it out, add it to your nightstand, and study it, as it'll give both of you a view on things you may not have had.

The Ugly Side of The Game	IMAGINE THIS, the conclusion to Let That Be The Reason, tells the story of the other side of the game, the side that is not glamorized - the ugly side.  Pamela is behind bars awaiting trial, while new evidence continues to surface that will keep her there for a very long time.  Chino, the father of her son, turned his back on her and has no regrets. The crew she once kept company with are nowhere around and continue to hustle without giving her further thought.  She is left only with the support of her family, but they can not solve her problems, only she can see to it that she comes out on top.<br /><br />IMAGINE THIS started out as a very intense read.  I was able to feel the pain and anguish Pamela went through while in prison.  The longing for her son and the emotional instability of not knowing the outcome of her situation felt real.  It was heart wrenching and I would have shed a tear but Ms. Stringer threw in a bit of comic relief to lighten the mood.  The novel is written with great emotion but the storyline weakens when it focuses on peripheral characters and not on Pamela.  It started out with a bang but ended with a  fizzle.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-12-02
The Sweetest Word	Rita Dove is a highly acclaimed poet and a former Poet Laureate of the United States with many accolades and honors.  Her latest publication, AMERICAN SMOOTH, is a collection of forty-four poems infused with the history of World War I, the enjoyment of dancing, and issues of everyday life.<br /><br />My favorite selections are \\"Meditation at Fifty Yards, Moving Target\\", which makes shooting a gun sound so poetic and \\"Heart to Heart\\" which downplays the myths one associates with the heart (shape and color), and all the cliches individuals use in terms of it (from the bottom of my heart), and breaks down what it really is (muscle) and what people need to keep it going (love).<br /><br />Although I was not able to enjoy the collection in it's entirety, I enjoyed several of the poetic offerings similar to those mentioned above.  Those that I did not identify with were well written, its just that I was not able to relate to those pieces, but that is the beauty of poetry, there is something for everyone.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-12-02
The World Is A Stage	Olive Hunt, born the early part of the last century, came of age during the stresses of the Great Depression. Not one to let setbacks get her down, she and her husband worked at many jobs to ensure the survival of their family. As the situation began to ease, her husband strayed and Mrs. Hunt found herself divorced and alone with her children. Once again she rose to the occasion and overcame the obstacle thrown in her path. She started with a job in real estate and moved into politics, ending up in Washington DC in the office of the congressman from Tennessee.<br /><br />While the narrative of the book is short, the letters Olive wrote to her mother swell the book to over 300 pages. The letters tell the real story of Mrs. Hunt's exciting life in the nation's capitol. She was there for the March On Washington in August 1963. She felt Martin Luther King's call for change was \\"legislation by blackmail\\" and questioned whether it was the way we wanted to run the country. She was there when Kennedy was assassinated and later for the election of Nixon. It was obvious throughout that she wasn't in favor of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />It was an interesting book and brings back the memories of those unsettled times in the United States. It is good for recalling the pros and cons of the turbulent mid-century changes in America. It would be a book well worth reading for history buffs. I found the book interesting and a reminder that not everyone was on the same page during the sixties as is sometimes proclaimed. I would have liked for Mrs. Hunt to give more details about her personal life during the depression and how she and her family recovered once it was over.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-12-02
A Love So Strong	When Sam Rivers lost his wife a part of him died with her.  After her death, he was never able to love their daughter Lisa as a father should and it has caused a lifelong rift between them.  Zach Rivers is the only thing they have in common but he is also a source of conflict.  There are secrets and lies surrounding Zach's parentage and as the old adage goes only the truth will set them free.<br /><br />Lisa has created an unbreakable computer program with Zach's safety in mind.  Her program is designed to bring home lost and kidnapped children.  With her program, anyone in the world can be located and brought to safety, with the aide of undetectable tracers.  The President and the Department of Defense, her employer, have taken an interest in her program.  It has also caught the attention of Dustoff, a deranged and twisted man who wants Lisa and her program to help him control world leaders.  The program and the bond that she has with Zach will be the key to her safe return.<br /><br />Linda Armstrong-Miller has penned a phenomenal thriller worthy of the big screen.  The description on the back cover of the book does not give the storyline justice.  It contains family drama, covert operations and espionage.  BLOOD AND WATER has the right mix of action and suspense from beginning to end. There is never a dull moment in the storyline.  I eagerly look forward to future works by Ms. Armstrong-Miller.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-12-02
Are we healed?	Reparation - a: a repairing or keeping in repair b: the act of making<br /><br />amends, offering expiation, or giving satisfaction for a wrong<br /><br />or injury. --Webster<br /><br />Is reparation what America needs? THE PACMAN PLAN is the story of<br /><br />the struggle for reparation, of reconciliation for the descendants<br /><br />of slaves who lived in bondage. This fictionalized story is<br /><br />told through the lives of two prominent figures, Reverend Solomon<br /><br />Jones, leader of one the largest churches in the South, and<br /><br />underworld figure, Joe Louis Brown. Both claim credit for the plan,<br /><br />as they interface with the lives of four uniquely different<br /><br />characters. An interracial couple, a socially conscious rapper and<br /><br />a young college student. Each is taken through the racial, political<br /><br />and social whirlwind that engulfs the nation.<br /><br />The Pacman Plan is a grassroots movement that began on a website.<br /><br />Initially it started out as a political movement to get elected<br /><br />officials to hear the masses, and an attempt to break the link<br /><br />between money and the candidates. Because the reality is that a<br /><br />political action committee (PAC), lobbyists with their soft<br /><br />money and special interest groups, actually control the government.<br /><br />Reparation was added to the Plan with hopes that it would become<br /><br />the modern day civil rights cry that would unite African Americans.<br /><br />Jones and Brown have the same goals, but different agendas. The<br /><br />crossfire from their efforts causes an undercurrent that evokes the<br /><br />ire of the FBI. And an all out witch-hunt is raged on everyone<br /><br />involved with the movement. Complicating things is Jones's side<br /><br />agenda, as the creator of the Pacman website he has a separate and<br /><br />surprising reason for starting the Plan.<br /><br />Although the author heralds this as fiction, it shares Kempt's real<br /><br />conviction, that America has never faced the truth about this<br /><br />country's most inhuman period and most significant economic<br /><br />windfall. THE PACMAN PLAN combines drama, sex and murder and blends<br /><br />it into an engrossing political thriller. Readers will be encouraged<br /><br />to take another look at the relationship between blacks and whites.<br /><br />Some will wonder if we have indeed made monumental strides in healing<br /><br />racial tensions or if we are just an incident away from another Los<br /><br />Angeles in 1992.

Will the rain ever stop?	Louis Kincaid, who is a private investigator and a loner by choice, would like to be more than friends with Susan Outlaw who is a defense attorney. She has issues with trusting and letting anyone get close to her. Louis finally asks her for a date and when he goes to pick her up, she has decided to cook dinner at home for him and Benjamin, her son from a previous marriage. Louis is a little disconcerted but goes along with the program. Just before dinner is finished, the husband whom Louis finds out is not really an ex, shows up and rains on their parade. Austin, who deserts his family for years at a time, uses his son to get at Susan. He demands that she let the child visit with him. Eleven-year-old Ben has missed his father and begs to go with him. Susan relents and then the trouble really starts. The two disappear after his business partner and secretary are found dead in their Miami office. Evidence points to Ben and Austin's deaths also but neither Louis nor Susan will give up hoping or searching for the missing duo.<br /><br />P.J. Parrish weaves family dysfunction, love affairs, homosexuality, and the chase for the dollar into a great whodunit that will keep the reader's attention until the last page. There are interesting and informative visits to the swamps of Florida as well as to the prison where inmates may have information helpful to the investigation. The middle of the book was a bit slow as the search for Ben continued and each clue ended in a dead end, however, it is definitely a book the reader will want to finish in one sitting.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-12-02

When translated \\"Nia\\" means purpose.  We are encouraged to know our purpose and be in tune with ourselves to achieve our career goals.  We must be real with ourselves by asking; \\"What am I here to do?\\" and \\"What can I do to effect a change?\\"<br /><br />The NIA GUIDE offers sound advice from many successful African American women ranging from broad categories as Keeping Your Pride and Sanity, A Sister's Map to the Corporate Minefield and Tips for Taking It To the Next Level.  It is insightful and requires personal reflection.  Within the three categories are 13 individual flowing chapters that discusses being the sole woman of color in the workplace and how to embrace our uniqueness while maintain a positive role within the workforce.  The reader is encouraged to be able to talk the talk and be prepared to speak the language necessary for the job you want.  Corporate America is compared to a game of football and all to often, we don't come to play.  We are reminded the key to Corporate America is to understand the game and play it to win!  Even if we stumble along the way, we must learn to turn setbacks into comebacks by turning the lemons handed to us by life into lemonade.  In the racism and sexism chapter, Paula Sneed, the Group VP of Kraft Foods, states \\"Racism and Sexism in the workplace is so prevalent, we have to be able to use the fact that we are women and women of color to our advantage.

A Love So Strong	A reader should never judge a book by its size, especially if it is of the caliber of A LOVE SO STRONG by Kendra Norman-Bellamy.  In juggling my reading list around and trying to get to books as quickly as possible, I found myself a bit hesitant to jump into a 350+ page book simply because shorter reads are normally faster reads.  After actually sitting down and forcing myself to stop worrying about the page count, I lost myself in the pages and in the lives of main characters, their friends, and family.  It is a story which caused much reflection and retrospect and one in which readers can not only be entertained, but also enlightened and inspired.<br /><br />Bryan and Nicole Walker are newlyweds, enjoying life and each other, surrounded by good friends, a great church home, and successful businesses.  They're secure in their place in life and appreciative of the blessings God has bestowed upon them.  However, there is one thing that could make their lives even more fulfilling, more of a symbol of their love -- a child.  Unfortunately after repetitive tries and trips to the doctor, it isn't likely Nicole will ever be able to receive this ultimate gift.  After convincing themselves they're okay with the situation, they proceed with loving each other and continuing to love life.  Just as things seem fine, a woman from Bryan's past steps into their lives turning their world in a way in which it almost slides off its axis.  She presents her 12-year old son, who is almost a replica of Bryan, and claims he is the father.  With the strong resemblance of the child and her adamant claims of his parentage, Bryan and Nicole turn towards their Pastor, who is also Bryan's uncle, for guidance.  As expected, their marriage goes through major upheavals and while it isn't a case of infidelity, Nicole is burdened with the weight of knowing her husband has a child with another woman.  It tears her apart and places her emotionally and mentally out of Bryan's reach.<br /><br />Though only a small part of what happens in this book, the above gives the reader a glimpse inside the pages of this story and shows the dynamics involved.  Even though she is a newcomer to the literary scene, in this her second literary offering, Kendra Norman-Bellamy has created a wonderful, inspiring story of unconditional love and the effects the past can have on your present and future.  Through the characters' faith, belief, and hope in not only each other and themselves, the reader is also shown the abundant range of God's blessings, love, and plan for each of our lives.  I was picked up, put down, and tossed around while reading this novel, with each and every one of my emotions being attacked, caressed, or filled through the power of what the characters went through.<br /><br />A few things I really enjoyed about this novel was the portrayal of a strong marriage, the view of Bryan handling his responsibilities and making steps to not only secure his son's future, and also to reach in his past and forgive his father for some of the shortcomings of their relationship.  I also loved the humor between the friends, especially from Nicole's best friend Sharon, and the interaction between the two couples, the church members, and also seeing each of them help the others through their turmoil and also celebrating the joys.  So often in situations of strife, we find ourselves alone and those we considered friends are nowhere to be found - that is, until the clouds clear and the sun shines again.<br /><br />Overall, this is such an inspiring, positive read on so many levels I could continue to go on and on (as seen from the length of this review).  Norman-Bellamy rounds out the book with a cast of well-developed characters, quite a few plot twists, and unexpected happenings.  The author has succinctly captured the Christian Fiction genre in a way that isn't preachy, boring, or stifled, and gives a full view of relationships, friendships, and the bond between them.  And to think I almost passed it up because of the size...what a treat I would've missed!  (RAWSISTAZ Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

More Alex Cross...	It's not often that books come across my desk that I won't even log them in, refusing to let them leave my house, and be sent to one of our other 20-member team, but upon receiving LONDON BRIDGES, I logged off the computer and immediately started reading.  James Patterson is an all-time favorite and I really enjoy the Alex Cross series, focusing on the ex-homicide detective, now FBI Agent, and his encounters with the bad guys.  Patterson is known as the master of suspense and his trade-mark short chapters and fast-paced reads are favorites amongst many mystery and thriller readers.  In this his 10th segment of the Alex Cross series, he has the short chapters and fast-paced action, yet LONDON BRIDGES is held down a little, slowed by the intercontinental backdrops of London and Frankfurt.<br /><br />Alex is called in from vacation when a bomb totally destroys a small town in the Nevada desert and soon recordings reach FBI headquarters and a lone person is seen watching the happenings a short time before the bomb lands.  It's none other than one of the bad guys from a previous installment, The Weasel.  However, he's not working alone.  Shortly thereafter, the various branches of government are gathered together to receive a special message...from The Wolf, Alex's nemesis from the prequel to this book, The Big Bad Wolf. He's out for revenge and seems to have quite a bit of players involved in his master plan of chaos and destruction.<br /><br />As the norm, he stays one step ahead of the authorities, in several major cities and abroad, and once he makes his demands known, it's a race against time to stop the bombing of bridges across the globe, or at the least, find someone who knows something about his identity.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just a bit \\"too much\\" to read about terrorists bombing cities and killing innocent people after the incidents of 911 and our current state of unease in the Middle East, but the thought of the bad guy getting away time after time, really left me with a feeling of doom in LONDON BRIDGES.  Or perhaps the Alex Cross series is dying out a bit (though I hope not).  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I felt a slight disappointment after closing the last page, similar to that felt when finishing the 9th book in the series, Big Bad Wolf.<br /><br />The scenes with the Cross family and reuniting with Sampson did help to balance out the story and switch the focus to the personal side of Alex.  We're even given a few crumbs of possibility with his love interest(s) that may pop up in future reads.  In spite of this, those who haven't read the previous novels are encouraged to read them first as there's not much background and the reader is expected to know the background, especially as it pertains to The Wolf and The Weasel, as well as the Cross family.<br /><br />After all of the excitement, the chase, the finale, I'm simply left with a \\"that's it\\" question racing through my thoughts.  Patterson abruptly ends the novel, with a smidge of closure, but does so in a way that's too abrupt, too \\"simple\\" considering all that had been going on previously in the novel.  I kept flipping to make sure I hadn't missed anything, but no such luck, nada, finit, the end.  (RAWSISTAZ Rating: 3.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

It's all about acceptance	Sharon Rae North takes readers on an exciting journey through rhyme, reason and heart.  The characters of the book are from different cultures and don't have anything in common, right down to their legs.  Instead of embracing the thought of having lost a leg and living with an artificial one, the main character shows the true meaning of \\"playing the hand you've been dealt.\\"<br /><br />Having been afflicted by sickness is often disheartening and frustrating.  Through this story, the life of a little girl has been shaped and molded to share with others the value of accepting yourself.  MY BRAND NEW LEG is a great juvenile rendition of believing in yourself.  Another plus: it comes with a CD-ROM, allowing readers to exercise their technology skills as well.<br /><br />Written with sincere detail and beautiful illustrations, Sharon Rae North has taken an ordinary barrier of childhood affliction and crafted a bridge of friendship, trust and bravery.<br /><br />Reviewed by T.

Redemptive	LOST LETTERS is a collection of poetry that speaks to the heart of someone who is spiritually empty.  The book offers fresh and encouraging perspectives to the daily perils that a person may face and it is these very messages that resonate strongly throughout the book.  Although the book is not large, LOST LETTERS carries an enormous message in regard to the daily walk with God.<br /><br />The poem \\"Never\\" delicately paints a picture of someone that is blind to God's miracles and fails to recognize the surrounding beauty.  One of my favorites is \\"Walking by Faith.\\"  This references a familiar passage of the Bible which states we should walk by faith and not by sight.  In this poem, the metaphorical use of the language paints a picture that lyrically lilts off the tongue.  This poem speaks to possessing a radical faith, believing in the power of prayer and having the patience to wait for God's blessings.  In \\"Arithmetic\\", Mixon doles out a hard-hitting contradiction by pointing out that as Christians, we are quick to ask for God's forgiveness and expect to receive it immediately.  Yet, when others ask us for forgiveness, we tend to deliberate the situation with a hardened heart.  The poem goes on to speak about the power of Jesus residing deep within us and letting His awesome light pour from our beings.  All in all, LOST LETTERS is not a book which can be taken lightly because it requires introspection.  I offer kudos to Mr. Mixon on a job well done.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05
Love at first sight	In her sophomore effort, Katherine D. Jones revisits characters from her debut novel Love Worth Fighting For.  When a notorious Chilean drug cartel is apprehended, Kevin DePalma, after being placed in the witness protection program, begins his life anew as a nightclub owner in Memphis, Tennessee.  Kevin will never forget that dreadful day or Maria Thomas, the very beautiful FBI agent who saved his life.<br /><br />While undercover as an illegal gun dealer, Maria walks into a nightclub and suddenly finds herself being kissed senseless by a total stranger.  Once she recovers, she recognizes the man who could have just ruined her cover is Kevin.  Maria had no idea she would ever lay eyes on him again or the fact that their attraction would be so strong.  Facing the possibility of Maria's cover being blown, the assistant director comes up with a brilliant idea, that she and Kevin pretend to be lovers.  Will this little charade become more than Kevin and Maria can bear?<br /><br />Ms. Jones has written yet another intriguing tale filled with murder, mayhem, espionage and suspense.  Readers of her first novel who are wondering what happens when these two cross paths will not be disappointed.  Although this novel stands alone, I would recommend reading the previous novel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05
Safety First	Protecting children is a parent's responsibility and Christian J. Bezick has written THE CHILD SAFETY GUIDE FOR NEW AND EXPECTING PARENTS to help readers meet that responsibility.  Bezick is founder and president of the American Family Safety Network.  He is a specialist in the arena of child safety.  The guide covers topics such as childproofing, sleep safety, car seats, infant products, and much more.<br /><br />Bezick provides an alarming statistic that shows more than 4 million children under the age of 5 were injured and required medical attention in 2002.  He goes on to say safety must be learned.  Parents and caregivers instinctively look out for obvious dangers to children, but THE CHILD SAFETY GUIDE FOR NEW AND EXPECTING PARENTS points out the not so obvious dangers and arms readers with extra knowledge and comfort to protect their children.  This guide should be required reading for anyone who is given the charge to care for children.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05
He who findeth a wife...	Life is never a bowl of cherries, and tragedy always seems to come at the most inopportune time.  Doctor Gregory Dixon and his best friend Derrick Madison found out the hard way when Derrick's mother gets killed in a horrible car crash.  Although the families are rooted and grounded in the word of God, Derrick cannot seem to shake his hatred of the one person who was responsible for his mother's death.<br /><br />Gregory has never found love - at least, a love he could cherish for the rest of his life.  His latest patient, who is in a coma, seems to be the one thing he has been waiting for.  His problem: she is the other driver.  Faced with the issue of sacrificing his life-long friendship for the woman of his dreams, Gregory turns to the one true source of guidance and comfort:  the Lord.<br /><br />This story was warm, heart-felt, biblically-based and spiritually grounded, appealing to all types of readers.  Kendra Norman-Bellamy shows the literary world that faith, values and trust in God's word will always prevail.  It starts a little slow, but eventually gathers speed, ending as a quick read.  Although the ending was very unrealistic, FOR LOVE AND GRACE is guaranteed to uplift your spirits, giving you hope that some love stories do come true.

The Story of a Legend	What makes a legend? Is it their talent? Is it their presence? Must one possess a little of both in order to be revered?  Hank Aaron, a talented baseball player from Mobile, Alabama became a legend when he broke Babe Ruth's home run record, but before that, he was a talented all-around player for the Milwaukee Brewers and the Atlanta Braves.<br /><br />Hank's journey to beat the Babe's record was not without obstacles and setbacks.  While pursuing the record and playing for Atlanta, a losing team at the time, the stands were nearly empty.  He received degrading mail that threatened his life and that of his children. He heard boos emanating from the stands. But why? Wasn't this man a great baseball player who was on his way to claiming the home run record? He was, but he was African-American, and many baseball fans did not take kindly to the thought of a black man stomping on Babe Ruth's record. But despite the racial slurs, discouraging letters, and enormous pressure to knock them out of the park, Hank Aaron remained a calm force and an admirable role model. Hank Aaron's career home run record, set in 1973, is yet to be broken.<br /><br /> Tom Stanton did a nice job of reviewing the history of Aaron, while adding a personal element to the textbook stats, players' names, and chronology. The reader is allowed to know Hank, to support him, to root for him, to feel for him.  A true baseball fan will love this recount of baseball history.

Free at last!	Cynthia Evans is recovering from a bad relationship. After years of abuse, she leaves her abuser and wants to make the absolute most of her freedom. Unexpectedly, her husband dies and she goes wild. Cynthia doesn't put any thought into what she is doing. Her only question before she embarks on a sexual union is \\"will it make me happy for the moment?\\" She insists on no meaningful or long-term relationships, no ties, only one night stands. Her teenage daughter, Chris, gets caught up in her mother's bad judgment and suffers along with her.<br /><br />Cynthia gets into fights with long time friends and employees; people around her begin to die and the police look closely at her. Depressed, alone and frightened, she decides to make a sudden move across the country with a new lover. Will it work out for her and Chris? Or is it another dead end?<br /><br />Shelly L. Foster has written a suspenseful novel about change, love, mistakes and bad judgment. It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait for Cynthia's next escapade. Unfortunately, the editing could have been better. There were punctuation errors, paragraphs weren't aligned and it was difficult at times to tell if a character was thinking something or saying it out loud. It was also hard to follow who was speaking because no attributions were used. If those things were cleared up, it would be a top-notch book.

Mind-Ride	MIDNIGHT IN OZ is a reasonably interesting read with engaging characters and a complex plot.<br /><br />The story features Jack Stuart, a man who has it all; a beautiful wife a terrific job and two very well behaved children.  Instead of feeling contentment, however, Jack has this inexplicable urge to leave it all and start over.  He acts on this feeling on his drive home from work one evening, and heads for Florida, where he attempts to catch a flight to Paris.  Things spiral out of control at the airport, and Jack ends up aborting his trip, heading instead to his condo, where he gets an unexpected visitor.<br /><br />Kristen is a Harvard law student and a vagrant of sorts.  Plagued by dreams of being buried alive, she has an irrational fear of flying.  Kristen is on the move, when she witnesses a deadly stabbing, in which the victim directs her to Jack's address with his dying breath.  When Jack tells her that he has never heard of the murder victim, she is astounded and they are initially suspicious of each other.  They eventually discover that they have something in common; they are both amnesiacs.  With too many unanswered questions, they embark on a quest for truth.  What follows is a fascinating mind-ride that takes the reader into a surreal world of unimagined revelations.<br /><br />Roger Helm takes a complicated subject matter and weaves a uniquely fascinating story around it, delivering it in a manner that keeps the reader involved from its  beginning to its stunning conclusion.  The depth of the scientific data presented gets a bit overwhelming at times but as a whole this book is a complex, well orchestrated story that opens the readers imagination to some of the moral and ethical implications of modern scientific advancements.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05
Good Men Do Exist	Stop the press, we have a winner. WHY CAN'T YOU SEE ME? GOOD MEN DO EXIST! by Christopher J. Cokley and Aaron M. Blake is a must read guidebook to answering the ladies' ongoing question; where are the good men. The majority of the sisters think they understand men. However, the authors threw down on us sisters and believe me it was the best in your face literature I have ever enjoyed reading.<br /><br />WHY CAN'T YOU SEE ME? GOOD MEN DO EXIST! is a self-help book that begins with the revolution of dating and the negativity we have about black males including but not limited to the dating outside your race centrum and the metamorphosis of the hip-hop generation. We have come a long way baby from the respectable male knocking on the door with flowers in hand to the assortment of thuggish type males who will blow the car horn yelling your name. Christopher J. Cokley and Aaron M. Blake very skillfully removed the myths that all men are alike and want only one thing from a relationship.<br /><br />The book highlights that male and female interactions are to be reckoned with because present day attitudes dictate that we have gone beyond the reproach of establishing healthy romantic relationships. WHY CAN'T YOU SEE ME? GOOD MEN DO EXIST!  outlines the areas that both male and female need to work on in order to establish a positive commitment with a good man and woman. The sexual revolution has made sex the number one priority between a man and a woman leaving behind education, job status, and financial stability. Therefore, good men have become invisible to the female because her new age definition of a relationship has changed over the years.<br /><br />The authors' explanations are remarkable and detailed with in-depth research, which makes simple sense. Mr. Cokley and Mr. Blake have opened up doors of understanding  about the black male's upbringing and becoming a man. Their priorities differ because of peer pressure and sometimes lack of male role models during the growth and development stages. Some women  see them as mere males, fine, smooth talkers, GQ dressers, with money and perhaps a good job;  fancy ride and skilled lovers. What I learned in WHY CAN'T YOU SEE ME? GOOD MEN DO EXIST! defines a different side of the black male that comes with mixed emotions and intelligence that reaps havoc with the myths of past and present.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because the authors didn't beat around the bush nor did they make excuses, they just presented the good man ideology in a nice package that you can either take or leave it. Mr. Cokley and Mr. Blake truly did their homework. They candidly describe the good man and how you can recognize him.<br /><br />It is a wonderful page-turner because for once there is hope for seeking a good man, but it is also telling us sisters that we have some serious work to do on ourselves as well. In addition, the poetry selections gave even more depth and soul searching for the reader.<br /><br />If you're wondering why you can't find a good man, I suggest you run to the store and purchase WHY CAN'T YOU SEE ME? GOOD MEN DO EXIST! You're in for a rude awakening and great insight that reveals it's not just the brother, but it could be you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthe growth and development stages.

Crazy In Love	Have you ever been so in love with someone that no matter what he or she did or how they treated you, you stuck by them through thick and thin? You love the person so much that you overlook their flaws no matter how damaging they may be to you? No matter how good you treat them they continue to emotionally, mentally and physically abuse you? You can't imagine your life without their love and essentially they are the air you breathe? But do you continue to just take it, or do you realize the gem you are and do something about it? In PAINTED PICTURE by Sheila Peele-Miller we see where love can do more harm than good. Is it true what they say about love being blind?<br /><br />Alicia Bradley is a pretty, smart, young woman who was raised in New Bern, NC. Growing up in a home surrounded by love and stability, Alicia doesn't know the meaning of the word dysfunctional. While Alicia is away at college she meets fine, sexy, and debonair Derek Hendricks. When Derek lays eyes on Alicia he feels she could be his queen the one to assist in turning his life around. Derek grew up in a dysfunctional home where drinking and fighting were as common as day and night. Never feeling loved by his mother, Derek has so much hate in him, he is a little leery of trusting someone with his heart.<br /><br />As the old saying goes \\"opposites attract\\" and Derek and Alicia are no exception, they not only begin dating but also eventually end up marrying. Living in the heart of Chicago's mean streets, life with Derek is a far cry from Alicia's tranquil life with her parents in NC. Trying to survive a roller coaster whirlwind life, Alicia has to look deep within herself to discern if this is a life she wants to continue to lead. Will love prevail and Derek change his wicked ways? Or will his violent rages dissolve his marriage?<br /><br />PAINTED PICTURE is a touching, heart-wrenching tale of love, lies, deceit and abuse. My heart went out to Alicia as she struggled with whether to stay in the relationship or get out while the getting was good. The abuse she endured made me want to go and talk some sense into her and make her realize just how special she is. What I enjoyed most about the book was how realistic it was and the character development.  I felt like I knew Alicia and Derek personally and wanted to do all I could to help them.  They loved each other so much and there was no doubt how deep their feelings were for one another.

Harsh Tradition	Nasarian is an outcast within her Kenyan tribe. She is even despised by several of her family members. Nasarian's only crime was being born to a Samburu father and his fourth wife, a Somalian. Considered a \\"half-breed\\" because of her Somalian blood and looked down upon because her mother was the last wife, Nasarian is however, shown great love and adoration from both her parents. Developing a sense of pride and independence from her mother, Nasarian continued to raise eyebrows within her community by choosing to be formally educated and refusing to be circumcised for marriage. Instead, Nasarian read books of poetry and dreamed of going off to far away places to become a writer. Soon her protective world crumbled around her. First her father dies leaving all the women in her family vulnerable to the actions and decisions of the males in the family. Then Nasarian's mother wills herself to death rather than be given away to one of her husband's cousins. Left alone and defenseless against those in her family who wish her ill will, Nasarian must leave her home and go live with her brutal elder brother.<br /><br />Disgusted that she will not be circumcised therefore, forfeiting being married, Nasarian is given to a cousin to help raise his youngest daughter. Nasarian is forced to come face to face with the brutality of female circumcision when she watches helplessly as her young cousin is forced to endure the procedure, only to die soon after. Witnessing the tragic death pushes Nasarian further and further away from wanting to engage in the traditions of the Samburu. Now seeking a life she only dreamed of, she must endure further trials and tribulations to become the woman she wants to be.<br /><br />RED MOON by Kuwana Hausley is a tale that is both heartbreaking and triumphant. RED MOON speaks volumes of the brutal tradition of female circumcision. In Nasarian it also gives a feminist approach to the topic. Hausley brings the Kenyan countryside to life for her readers. The contrast between the modern world and the ancient traditions of the tribes are strikingly displayed. Nasarian plight as well as those of all the women in the novel, tugs at the heart strings. The traditional tribal ways subject the women to a status of nothing greater than third class citizens. It is shocking that in this day and age much of the world has yet to catch up to the ideal of equal rights for women.<br /><br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerss.

Across the Field	Life had been fairly simple for Sister.  Living in an adequate, three-bedroom house with just enough room for her mother, two brothers, sister and niece, she always had plenty to eat and plenty of company. In the small town where she grew up, her friends had been around forever and nothing changed much.  Even though it was the early 1970's and the world around her small Kentucky town was in turmoil, people in Bourbon County didn't forget that, \\"everything either black or white.\\"<br /><br />Remembering that the racial divide existed proved easy for Sister; however acting on that knowledge became increasingly difficult when the Mandarenes moved into the mansion across the field from her family's humble home.  Not many white people resided in Bourbon County, and before the new family could step out the car good, the whole town knew of their arrival.  The lady of the house wasted no time in seeking help to run the mansion that she, her son, and her father would come to call home.  Sister was the first to cross the field for a job, and that crossing would prove to be the first of many different types of crossings for her and Evian Mandarene as they embarked on a sweet, honest love affair that defied race, time, and the opinions of their family and friends.<br /><br />ENEMY FIELDS by J. Marie Darden is a wonderful, contemporary \\"old school\\" read.  Relishing in a non-traditional, non-predictable, non-fairy-tale ending, this classically set romance proves to be passionate yet true-to-life and not overly sentimental.  The descriptions are adequate, and the language of the novel is simple yet very effective in conveying the story presented. Using effective transitions, Darden tells the plight of Sister and Ev in a superb point of view format that proves excellent in capturing the very nature and essence of the story being told.  I adored the southern qualities the author embellishes the novel with, especially the food! This book made me so hungry and made me miss home with a vengeance.  Sister's voice took a little time to adjust to, but once I did, I was fully able to truly embrace her personality and the story she was telling. I was able to get to know her well, and I liked her a lot.  I didn't want this story to end because I felt that I knew these people, like they could have been friends of my parents.  Even though the story came full circle, it segmented nicely into the sequel that I'm very much looking forward to reading.<br /><br />Only two things subtracted from the book. One, the chapter divisions were off.  Chapters generally separate thought patterns, any type of change in the story, or some form of varying content, however, these chapters were too frequent and not far enough in between, and what they separated confused instead of helped. Second, I didn't like Sister's name.  Throughout the book, I came to know her as Sister and at the end when I was finally given her name, I didn't like it because it didn't fit the image I had created of her. Otherwise, Darden has penned a delightful first novel, and I wish her much creative luck as she finishes up the sequel.

To their surprise, they develop an attraction to each other, even though they think they have both lost their minds and that the feelings won't be reciprocated.  During a trip to Las Vegas to attend the wedding of friends of Angelique's, they imbibe a little too much champagne which lands them in an unexpected predicament.  Will they make the best of the situation or go back to being sworn enemies?<br /><br />Is there anything better than good, old-fashioned love and romance?  I think not!  Even though it doesn't always happen in real life, I'm a sucker for the fairy tale romance and happily ever after endings.  Every time I read a novel by Melanie Schuster, my feelings are reaffirmed.  Although A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS started off a tad slow, when the pace did pick up, it became another wonderful tale of love and happiness.  As long as Ms. Schuster keeps writing, I'll keep reading her books.  I'm a fan for life.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05

Just when it seems that things could not get any stranger, a woman seeks to hire Kincaid to investigate her father, whom she believes may be involved with the murder of the discovered woman. However, Kincaid soon discovers some hidden secrets of the man he is investigating that go beyond his wildest dreams. At first Kincaid believes that he has three separate cases on his hands until he slowly uncovers the shocking truth that links them all.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BONES by P.J. Parrish is a compelling thriller that takes many delicious twists and turns. The character of Private Investigator Louis Kincaid is a refreshing change from the brooding stereotypical investigator so often found in novels. Kincaid is a complex, three - dimensional character with realistic flaws. The novel itself is also one that is outside the box of the \\"typical\\" mystery. The characters are vivid and the story line unique. Although ISLAND OF BONES is the fifth installment in the Louis Kincaid mysteries, it surely is a standalone novel that will please both long standing Kincaid fans as well as those new to the character.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Let go and let God...	Why is it that when life seems to be perfect and everything is going well, out of the blue something happens to knock you for a loop?  This is exactly what happens to Serena Jasper.  The night she learns she has been accepted into a prestigious university, her mother delivers some devastating news which drastically changes everything Serena has believed about her life.  This news affects Serena so much, she no longer has faith in anyone, including God and especially her mother.  Up until this point, the relationship between Serena and her mother was ideal, her faith was strong and her spiritual compass set on the straight and narrow.<br /><br />Talk about a spiritual wake up call!  As I read SPEAK TO MY HEART, I wondered if the author had access to my life that I didn't know about.  While Serena's situation is not the same as mine, the feelings of doubt, insecurity, and a faltering spiritual life are the same things I am presently experiencing.  Mrs. Adams debut novel is not \\"preachy\\", nor is it filled with holier than thou characters who snub others for not being a \\"perfect\\" Christian.  Instead, her characters are normal, everyday people who strive to do God's will, but find themselves swayed by trials and tribulations and the cunning craftiness of the evil one.  Kudos to the author for a wonderful read which definitely spoke to my heart.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05
Any book lover can relate!	Books are like friends - you're happy to find one, sad to lose one and wait with eager anticipation when expecting one's arrival.  The love of literature is a strong link connecting readers everywhere to one common interest, reading.  The range of genres, be it fictional/non-fictional, mystery/autobiography and everything in between, transports us readers to another place, another time where we can lose ourselves in this new world as our hands turn the pages.  In SO MANY BOOKS, SO LITTLE TIME, Sara Nelson provides a whimsical glance at her life as a self proclaimed \\"readaholic.\\"  This book will have book lovers everywhere shaking their heads at the witty accounts of being addicted to books.  For instance, Nelson states, \\"exploring the moment of connection between a reader and a book to someone who never experienced it is like trying to describe sex to a virgin.\\"<br /><br />How many of us bookworms have \\"to be read piles\\" or as we fondly call them \\"TBR piles\\"?  Maybe you call your pile something else.  Just like a true bookworm, Nelson admits to categorically organizing her books into piles - \\"must read, might read and maybe someday.\\"  But, once that perfect novel is found, the reader may experience an emotional revelation.  Nelson describes it as an involuntary shaking, or just getting so lost within the book your reality just fades away.  No matter what feeling overwhelms us as readers, one thing is certain, our love of literature.  This is a passion that is a unifying bond transversing miles, races, cultures and mindsets transporting us into deeper thought, friendships and a space of our own by simply opening a book.  Simply said, reading is an escape.<br /><br />Nelson takes her readers on a year long journey as she muses about books she's read and provides general commentary on being a book lover.  As an avid reader, I must admit, Nelson has me beat, yet I did enjoy her flowing prose and descriptive styling.  I found myself laughing out loud at times because I could relate to the joy of being a book lover.  Nelson did not delve into any particular book of her choosing with any depth, but if you're looking for a light-hearted read, then I'd definitely recommend SO MANY BOOKS, SO LITTLE TIME.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersuse I could relate to the joy of being a book lover.

The dating game	The search for that special person can be a long, nerve-wracking journey or a very colorful lesson on love and commitment.  This journey can be one of great introspection and reflection that teaches us about our deepest desires and needs. LOOKIN' IN THE MIRROR takes a look into the lives of Vicki and Gerald, and their choices in the dating game.<br /><br />Vicki is a journalist who lives in Washington, D.C.  She and her all-girl posse take D.C. by storm.  From her own reflections she sees herself as a down-to-earth diva with a wonderful sense of humor and an attraction for sports. She also happens to be well educated, well paid, and very independent.  On one hand, she is every man's dream while on the other hand men fear her.  She also happens to have a serious commitment phobia.  Can she overcome her fears to make a commitment?  Will she even want to?<br /><br />Gerald is a professional businessman who lives in Houston, TX with aspirations of moving to D.C.  He's got his professional life together in a well paying job with growth potential, he mentors a young man in his community, he's good looking, and he's intelligent.  Any woman would be happy to have a man like him.  But, he's been burned one time too many. He always seems to attract the one who \\"almost\\" meets his criteria.  In his search for a serious commitment, will there be any woman to meet his many qualifications?<br /><br />A. M. Hatter gives an often humorous and entertaining reflective look at Americans in the dating game, as roles have changed over the years.  No longer are women rushing to the marriage altar.  She covers the full gamut of dating situations we as African Americans may face. Written in a form similar to that of a personal journal for each of the two main characters, we took an insightful look into their lives for a full year as they discovered their desires, their weaknesses and their struggles to overcome insecurities.  I enjoyed the style which Hatter used to tell the story. The banter was lively, engaging and very down-to-earth. The only thing that could have made it better was a bit more editorial fine-tuning.

Time to reflect...	\\"Who am I? Where am I going? How am I getting there?\\" are just a few questions that could be coursing through your mind. Or maybe you are completely satisfied with your life and feel that everything is perfect and there is no need to change anything.  Wherever you are, whatever your current station in life, whatever you're searching for or running from, BLACK BY POPULAR DEMAND helps.  This book is more than sufficient in being a social enema for the backed-up structure of the African American culture and in serving up a healthy, heaping dose of life-changing reality to fill us instead.<br /><br />\\"We need to get back to our old family values and realize that it is our responsibility to make sure our children grow up with a strong sense of pride and respect for one another,\\" is just one of the many heartfelt revelations written by G. Ster in this collection of tough truths presented for us to gauge ourselves.  Without claiming to be an expert, Ster offers some of the most passionate, reality grasping, fundamental basics that we all should not only live by but also hold each other accountable for.  Whether a reader lacks focus or has it in abundance, BLACK BY POPULAR DEMAND helps to remind us of where we should be, how we should be acting (if we need reminding), or educate those of us who didn't know. Ster doesn't discuss things so deep that they don't really have any effect on the reader, but rather common dealings/frustrations that we all come across at some point in our lives; \\"common sense\\" matters that we all need to be reminded of every now and again.<br /><br />Although the title doesn't really fit the contents of the book, I am impressed and pleased with the opinions and suggestions Ster imparts.  He stirred ambitions in me that had been sleeping, and motivated me to take stock of my life and make positive changes where necessary.  Although I didn't read this book looking for help, Ster validated a lot of my frustrations with our culture and with dealing with people, places, and things in general.  Sounding as a friend might while you sat with him one crisp, fall afternoon and waited for your cars to be cleaned, Ster's voice is addictively conversational.  I wish I could say to him, \\"Yes, me too!\\" or \\"I know, I know.\\" I really enjoyed reading such a positive call for African Americans to get up, put their running shoes on, and join him as he takes control of life instead of sitting by and letting life control him.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswith people, places, and things in general.

Who Dunnit?	After the death of her husband, Assistant District Attorney Jordan La Fontaine has immersed herself in her work and is slowly losing touch with her teenage children Trevor and Kendre.  She's set on getting promoted to the Chief of Homicide for the Bureau, but keeps running up against obstacles that may cost her the position.  Just when things seem to be going well for her, both chaos and love hit her radar.<br /><br />First, she finds love in an unexpected place -- in the arms of her late husband's partner and friend, Simon McNeil.  Simon has taken over the company he shared with her husband and comes to her rescue when Trevor is arrested and charged with killing fellow students.  She also takes on a major case in which a cop is accused of killing and mutilating his ex-wife - a case that will determine whether or not she will be passed over yet again for promotion.  To make matters worse, her archenemy is the lawyer assigned to convict her son.  Things start out looking one way with both of the cases, but the evidence persuades those involved to look another way.<br /><br />R. Barri Flowers lets it all hang out in this fast paced mystery.  It has all the aspects of a perfect mystery, and thankfully, it isn't so predictable you figure out what's going on.  Instead, you're not quite sure what's what and who's who (and in a good way). One thing for sure, this novel had me completely caught up, making my own assumptions of what was going on and also anxiously reading from page to page.  While I wasn't too thrilled with the relationship Jordan had with Simon, I did enjoy seeing that side of her life.  I also enjoyed how Flowers adds in the race factor to the legal proceedings and the two trials and how it was played out for the reader.  It was great seeing a female ADA handle things both personally and professionally.  I liked Jordan La Fontaine's character and would love to see her on the big screen.

Take time to learn...	What is it that every woman has longed for, wished for, and prayed for since the beginning of time?  Through a cast of colorful characters and the seasons of their life, Victor McGlothin answers this question in his latest literary endeavor, EVERY SISTAH WANTS IT.<br /><br />Octavia Longbow and Cee Cee Lovely, friends and co-workers at a Dallas radio station, haven't had the best of luck in the romance department.  Octavia is in an on again, off again relationship with one of the hottest hip hop artists around.  Even though she knows their relationship is headed nowhere fast, Octavia hangs on in there.  But when she has a literal run-in with another man who stirs her senses to a degree she's never felt before, will Octavia step out of her comfort zone and experience what true love is all about?<br /><br />Cee Cee has yet to find the one man who makes her heart sing, so she lives vicariously through the lives of her friends.  Little does she know, but her Prince Charming has been right under her nose, and he's the last person she expected.<br /><br />When I first picked up this book, I wasn't really sure what \\"it\\" was.  The more I read though, the clearer it became.  Several times throughout this novel, McGlothin eloquently depicts the yearning that dwells deep within us all...men and women alike.  At one point I was so moved by his words that I became emotional and immediately marked the page so that when my husband begins to take me for granted, I can whip it out and read that particular passage to him to help him understand what this sistah wants.

Justice for all	Fixer and his lover, Paulo, have a dream to own their own record label. In order to finance their dream, they become bank robbers and con-artists. Always ten steps ahead of the police, a few years into the game, their label is taking off and they have no need to finance it through illegal means. Now they can concentrate on making their dreams reality, or can they?<br /><br />Over the past year, fifteen young boys have been kidnapped, tortured, mutilated, and murdered. The whole city is in an uproar, and the police have no leads. When Paulo sees someone dump a bag out of a truck into the park then speed off, he goes closer to investigate.  The bag contains the remains of a young boy-the sixteenth victim of the Romper Room Ripper.<br /><br />Paulo and Fixer conduct their own investigation and learn the identity of the serial killer, but don't go to the police. After all, who will the police believe; a pair of gay thugs often in trouble with the law, or a prominent televangelist? Paulo and Fixer know if the murders are to end, they have to call on the help of their boys to dole out a little street justice. Unfortunately for them, the televangelist and his crew don't intend on giving in without a fight.<br /><br />BLESS THE THUGZ AND THE LIL' CHIL'RINS drew me in on page one and wouldn't release me until I'd finished. I'm not into thugs, but Traynor was able to create believable thugs whom I found myself rooting for. Yeah they'd bang heads, do their drugs and other stereotypical thug activities, but Traynor kept them human and showed gradual growth throughout the novel. I look forward to Mr. Traynor's future work.  (RAW Rating: 4.5)<br /><br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-05
You've Got Mail	In today's world, the internet is one of the biggest forms of communication; there are chat rooms, online groups as well as pen pal sections where you can correspond with someone from just about anywhere in the world. The possibilities are endless. It's not uncommon for someone to meet a friend online or a potential significant other. In I SAW YOUR PROFILE by Rhonda Swan we are introduced to three women who are in search of love and who learn just how dangerous internet dating can be.<br /><br />Arianna Singleton is a widowed mother of two. She is a journalist who recently relocated to Philadelphia. Without any friends or family nearby, she is lonely and turns to the computer to meet friends and possibly someone special.

The Queen of Salsa.	The explosion of Latin music in America did not start with the likes of Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez or even Gloria Estefan. No, the introduction of the pulsating, hypnotic, rhythmic beats of Latin America was started over forty years ago and owes its unveiling in part to the powerful and soulful voice of Celia Cruz. Written by the diva  herself, CELIA: MY LIFE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY is a sentimental celebration of a musical journey that spanned more than half a century.<br /><br />Born of African descent in Havana, Cuba to a loving family of humble means, music was always a part of Celia's life from the first time her mother sung her a Spanish lullaby. Growing up, Celia was enthralled with the beautiful fusion of the Afro-Cuban music that was drenched within the island's culture. Cuba's musical landscape was quite eclectic and she was captivated by the varied musical styles that swept her homeland. She was influenced by everything, from salsa to samba. Acknowledged by family, friends and neighbors as having a glorious voice, Celia was encouraged to share her gifts with the world. Persuaded by a cousin to enter talent shows, as a teen she began wowing local audiences with her talent. It was just a short time before she became the toast of Cuba.<br /><br />With the blessing of her friends and family except her father, who wanted her to pursue a more \\"respectable\\" profession, Celia began pursuing music.  She began perfecting her skills by working the various nightclubs and musical revues in Cuba. It is through Celia's eyes that we are given a front row view of the beautiful and sultry nightclubs that were once part of Cuba's night life. The reader is given a rare look on and behind stage from Celia as she allows us to experience the exhilarating thrill of her performances. Through Celia's narration we are also given a bird's eye view of the changing politics of Cuba and the rise of Fidel Castro. She  frankly discusses how she witnessed the political turmoil that nearly tore her homeland apart and ushered in a dictator. Disenchanted with the political changes in Cuba, with a  heavy heart Celia decided to escape from the communist nation; sadly she left all she knew and loved behind. Upset and humiliated that one of the nation's most celebrated entertainers had defected from his country Fidel Castro forbade Celia from ever stepping foot on Cuba's soil again.<br /><br />Despite being banished from her homeland and a few personal and professional setbacks, CELIA: MY LIFE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY is a joyful testimony of a legendary singer's triumphs in life and within the music industry. Celia Cruz recently passed on leaving behind a catalog of wonderful music that will continue to be enjoyed by her legions of fans for years to come. Her voice will forever inspire and invite future generations to celebrate and treasure the pulsating beats of  Latin music.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

I Am Woman	Toby Thompkins showcases the lives of strong black women in THE REAL LIVES OF STRONG BLACK WOMEN: Transcending Myths, Reclaiming Joy.  Thompkins takes us on a journey through the lives of women who are considered strong and demonstrates how that strength, in some cases, can be a detriment to our joy and well-being.  Through interviews with both women and men from all walks of life, we are seen as the caregivers and nurturers of everyone from family to friends to co-workers at the expense of our own happiness. We are so good at it we do not realize that our destiny is at stake.<br /><br />The contents include three relationships that are paramount to our lives, the romantic love, platonic love and self-love.  Thompkins asserts that often we take care of the romantic and platonic love and discount the self-love. In each, subjects such as the wonder women, mother/daughter power struggle, dating with your eyes wide open and straight and lesbian sister relationships, just to name a few, are illustrated and provide powerful messages for change in our behavior. Finally, Thompkins offers suggestions for breaking the stranglehold we have on this age-old behavior in order to reclaim joy and peacefulness for ourselves.<br /><br />Thompkins writing includes historical aspects of the helping behavior and his writing is candid as are the interviews of the women and men; there is no sugar coating within the interviews.  This is a wonderful self-help analysis of the daily lives of strong black women and how we can overcome an often-negative behavior to live a full and meaningful life.

When she quits her job because she finds out that her boss, whom she just so happens to be in a relationship with, is married, it just adds more fuel to the fire.<br /><br />Hoping to escape and reevaluate her life, Delilah heads to Coree Island, where she meets attractive Dr. David Washington.  Neither Delilah nor David are looking for romance, but when love calls you have to answer.  The pull between them is so strong that, much to the dismay of their friends and family, the couple gets married only weeks after knowing each other.  When the initial blush of romance is gone, and the realities of married life set in, Delilah begins to question her hasty decision.  Will Delilah honor her marriage vows and stay with David through the good times and the bad, or will she throw in the towel?<br /><br />LOVING DELILAH was a satisfactory read.  There were numerous characters from the author's previous works that were oftentimes hard to keep straight.  Several times I felt the need to go back and re-read those other novels just to remember who was who and what their story was.  However, the love between the characters was endearing and a good example of what true love should be.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-11-04
Love and Redemption	Oftentimes books take forever to get going good, to get you caught up in what's going on, or at the least, a few chapters.  Obviously, Eric Pete has read a few of those types of books and decided his newest release won't have that problem.  GETS NO LOVE is a story about love and redemption, the past versus the present, and centers around relationships and how they work.  The book starts off with an opening sentence which immediately puts you on alert that some things are going down.  Don't believe me?  Read for yourself,  \\"The smell of gunpowder burned my nostrils while I tried to stop the bleeding.\\" (pg 1)<br /><br />Prepare yourself to meet childhood friends and bad boys Lance and Akhet.  Both grew up in the Ninth Ward section of New Orleans and found themselves in all kinds of trouble.  Now, one is a computer programmer, the other is a well-known rapper, both trying to do a bit better and get past their bad boy days.  Unfortunately, the past has a way of catching up with you, just when you're trying to do right.<br /><br />Lance has established himself both personally and professionally and is working hard to get his ex-fiancee back in his life.  When someone from his past surfaces, things get a bit shaky for him and he's left with decisions on how to proceed with his life.  Akhet still has his hard edges and isn't afraid to use them as necessary.  All hell breaks out when he's decided he's had enough of the drama and decides to take matters into his own hands.<br /><br />It isn't easy letting go of the past, or sometimes actually learning from it.  Neither is it always easy trying to do right, no matter how much a person may want to or try to.  In spite of this, one can always work towards redeeming themselves.  Eric Pete has taken an urban backdrop, melded it with characters you grow to love, and crafted a story in which you feel the action, from beginning to end.  He also clearly shows that relationships are held together by an invisible thread of so many things, mainly love, friendship, trust, and hope.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

The madam takes Eula Too in<br /><br />and nurses her back to health. Something about this young girl's<br /><br />innocence touches the madam's heart. She gives Eula Too a job as her<br /><br />personal assistant and over the years the two become friends.<br /><br />Now in her thirties, Eula Too realizes she still does not have a<br /><br />life or anything of her own.

Three sisters, one man	Annette, the Bible-thumping sister, may only be nineteen, but she's already in love with this magnificent man named Michael who rents an apartment in her mother's building. She can tell he thinks she's a little young and immature for him, but she knows someday he will see her as a desirable woman.<br /><br />Cora, the sexy sister, almost has a nervous breakdown when someone close to her heart dies of an ailment while the three sisters are working as missionaries in Africa. She withdraws into herself to find answers and refuses to return to the United States with her family. After a year of absence, she returns with a new zest for life, and soon she and Michael start a relationship. Michael wants marriage, but Cora isn't ready. She doesn't know what she's ready for.<br /><br />Brenda, the brainy sister, has loved Michael since she first saw him on their college campus. She'd never approached him, and when he moves into one of her mother's rental units, she must stay away because her baby sister Annette has eyes for him. With Annette's crush a thing of the past and Cora trying to find herself, Brenda doesn't see why Michael shouldn't marry her.<br /><br />Michael, the man in the center of the Bermuda Triangle, loves Cora with all of his heart, but Brenda is the sister who continues to show interest. Pulled in several directions, Michael makes a decision that could tear the sisters apart permanently.<br /><br />When I read the blurb on the back of WHEN EVERYTHING'S SAID AND DONE, I thought, \\"Oh no, another script for Jerry Springer.\\"  I'm pleased to say that I was totally and completely wrong. If there had been a six rating, WHEN EVERYTHING'S SAID & DONE would have received it. Eboni Snoe has outdone herself with the tale of these three sisters' love, loss, and final acceptance of one another.

Coming of Age	In her debut offering, MY SIDE OF THE STORY, Kia L. Reid presents a memoir of her experiences thus far and the affects that they have had on her life.  As if growing up as an adopted biracial child wasn't enough, at a young age Kia had to deal with a crack addicted father and the death of her closest friend.  It was during this time she also realized that she was anointed with the special gift of visions and foresight.<br /><br />The book also tells of Kia loves and losses.  She endured mentally and physically abusive relationships, and was raped several times.  In addition, she was betrayed by many people she trusted and backstabbed by several so-called friends.  Despite all of this she was able to see a silver lining around the dark cloud known as life.<br /><br />MY SIDE OF THE STORY shows how the author dealt with all of the adversities she faced and shows that we all else fails, one can always count on God.  The book was humorous at times, heart wrenching in some places, and had many situations that I could relate to.  It was almost as if I were peeking into the author's personal journal or diary.  However, I felt the story was a bit rushed.  I would have enjoyed hearing more about Kia's childhood and other aspects of her life than just her failed relationships.  I was also hoping that the author would elaborate a bit more on her spiritual relationship with God and her ability to see visions. Readers should also beware if they are offended by profanity as the book had many explicit terms. Nonetheless, I found MY SIDE OF THE STORY to be an enjoyable and extremely quick read.	2004-10-25

In it she knows she must be truthful and must purge the most hurtful and painful things onto paper so that her daughters will understand the amazing journey she has traveled.  She begins with the trials and tribulations of her Uncle Eddie, who from an early age was considered the protector of his mother, two older sisters and eventually Mignon's mother.  She learns how difficult it is to fulfill a calling when you cannot control others or God's will.  Then she learns from her aunts, cousins and even her own mother the purpose of the struggles they have withstood.  She also reflects on her stepfather, who never gave up on her and manages to encourage and teach her the lessons of God and His everlasting strength.  The paths of her family were paved with stones that at times seemed too large to cross over, however, the strength of the women and men enabled Mignon to believe and understand God's lessons.  The family endured infidelity, domestic abuse, sexual abuse, separation, death, murder and secrets.  It is those very secrets that rebuild this family and they eventually come full circle in all their lives.<br /><br />Mignon is proud of her family and her own story, because she ends up being reborn, strengthened and encouraged.

A Wake Up Call	America is often called the home of the free and the land of the brave.  Free - what is this really?  Does our political democratic structure provide these freedoms which we've come to recognize and seemingly take for granted?  As Americans, there seems to be a prevailing sense of cynicism clouding our thoughts of the whole democratic process.  In her book, TRUST, political analyst Farai Chideya delves into engaging discussions regarding the prevailing political climate that is blanketing America.<br /><br />The United States of America is a dominating powerhouse in the world arena when it comes to international policy; yet, within our own borders less than half of the qualifying electorate does not vote.  This equates to approximately 100 million Americans.  That is 100 million people who are unwilling, whatever the reason, to stand up and be heard during the upcoming Presidential election.  In her essays, Chideya digs into the historical past of America's political structure, prevailing sentiments and offers candid, flowing commentary based on her observations.<br /><br />With the 2000 presidential election, recent history is a prime example that each and every vote counts.  Chideya states, \\"American democracy is highly overrated, not necessarily in concept, but in its execution.\\"  Chideya is urging for a dynamic change to take place within our current political structure and within the Black community - the commonly disenfranchised voters require a confident resurgence in exercising their own basic rights.  In Chideya's opinion, this reinvigoration<br /><br /> will take place only by \\"rebuilding people's trust in government and their trust to shape it.\\"<br /><br />All in all, Ms. Chideya offers very timely, easy-to-understand commentary regarding mostly the political structure of the United States.  This type of book does not hail from my usually preferred genre, yet the essays captured my attention and provided me with a deeper understanding of some very relevant current day situations within our political structure.

It's hard to stay away	In THE FALCONS OF MONTABARD, medieval history comes alive.  Sabin Fitzsimon, born the illegitimate son of an earl, developed a reputation early on for his dalliances and conquests.  Caught literally with his pants down dealing with the king's favorite mistress, Sabin was beaten severely and left for dead by the king's soldiers. Later when the king's mistress is found dead, he blames himself for her death.  Sabin is given a new lease on life and a chance to redeem himself when Sir Edmond Strongfist asks him to accompany them on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he intends to offer his sword and services to the king of Jerusalem.  His only concern and request is that Sabin stay away from his covenant-raised daughter, Annais.  It shouldn't be a problem except that Annais is very beautiful and has more spunk than most men.  Annais is also intrigued by Sabin's reputation and good looks.<br /><br />Once in the Holy Land, Sabin works hard to restore his reputation, but meets resistance at every turn.  He agreed to stay away from Annais, but Sir Edmond's new wife, Mariamne is another story.  She is not playing heed to any such instructions.  She intends to have him at any cost and what results is Sabin being sent away again, but this time in service to Annais and her husband, Gerbert, as they travel to Montabard.  The politics of the Holy Land will have them all caught up in the maelstrom of war and change that will bring Sabin and Annais a lot closer than Strongfist would ever have imagined.<br /><br />Elizabeth Chadwick is indeed a master storyteller.  She weaved an interesting love story around the medieval times that included a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  With her command of the scenery and the history, I found myself truly caught up in this story from start to finish.  The character development was so good that the supporting characters were just as interesting as the primary ones. Those of you that are historical romantic buffs, this is an author worth checking out.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The Bottom Line	Look for it, and you'll find it.  The bottom line, the lesson to be learned, the moral of the story is visible for all who dare to look.  No matter what we go through in life, the bottom line is there for us to recognize it and the simple way it keeps us grounded (if we pay attention).  In I WISH I NEVER MET YOU, author Denise N. Wheatley shares with us quite a few bottom lines from one woman's crazy dating life.  Through all the drama, the burning down of apartments, the fights, the loving, and the laughter, the narrator identifies the hardcore reality of every one of her stories and unabashedly shares that with her audience.<br /><br />Aside from good morals, the narrator also shares with us some of the most hilarious, shocking, shameless, and disappointing dating stories that I have ever read or heard.  While I must admit that a few of the tales hit home for me, I'm very glad that my dating life isn't as bad as this woman's. Whew!  Sure, most of us have dated liars, cheaters, and/or abusers, but the men in this book take the cake.  So does our fearless narrator.  The main character from whose perspective author Wheatley writes is a force to be reckoned with.  She dropkicked one man on the dance floor, burned down another's apartment, and peppered sprayed another one in the club - all for very valid reasons, of course.  She's had to deal with married men, men who couldn't decide what team they were batting for, men with money, men who acted like they had money, and men who didn't care that they were broke as hell.  Although she has been through a lot, she survived and lived to share her horror stories with us.<br /><br />It is because of Denise N. Wheatley that I survived a three-hour train ride. Her novel, I WISH I NEVER MET YOU, had me laughing so hard and gasping so much that people kept staring at me wondering what was wrong with me.  I didn't care and read on, getting more and more engrossed into her comical writing style and the appallingly amusing dating stories she told.  There are thirteen stories divided into four sections, and the novel is full of colorful, well-portrayed characters.<br /><br />The narrator is a trip! Her voice is strong and flows well throughout all the stories.  While some crazy things happen, nothing is over the top.  True, all the drama is believable, but I would never have imagined people would actually do some of the things done in this book.  I enjoyed Wheatley's writing style. She often uses witty repetitions to hammer in a point, assist the reader in making connections, or for comic relief.  The section intros and quotes are well written and appropriately placed. I enjoyed all the stories, but my favorites are the ones in The Big Payback section.<br /><br />I also like how each story ends with an often amusing, but very true, bottom line.  My only problem with the book is the amount of foul language, but there is a good, forewarning disclaimer at the beginning. I WISH I NEVER MET YOU is a great debut novel by Wheatley.

It's the dog in me	NIGHT PLAY, the sixth book of the Dark-Hunter novels, is a spin off from the stories about the Dark-Hunters. It is a look into the lives of mythical creatures called Were-Hunters.  Were-Hunters are the results of an experiment by a sorcerer that was meant to help a dying race. The experiment produced two forms of humans that can live as animals also.  The Arcadians held human hearts and walked as humans but at puberty they possessed the ability to change into an animal form.  The Katagarians were born as animals and lived as animals until they also reached puberty and obtained a source of unlocked power that allowed them to change to human form while maintaining an animal's heart.  Angry with the interference of the sorcerer, the gods cursed the two races to die at each other's hands.<br /><br />Vane and Fang Kattalakis give new meaning to the phrase, \\"It's the dog in me.\\"  The two were part of Katagarian pack of wolves until a bad decision caused the death of their sister.  Due to the basic law of their pack, they were beaten and left for dead in their human forms in a swamp in New Orleans.  Vane manages to escape but with a severely battered Fang to look after.  Realizing that their pack wants them dead, Vane flees to the only place he knows is safe-The Sanctuary.  While friends at The Sanctuary are nursing Fang, Vane wanders upon Bride McTierney who has just been dumped by her boyfriend of five years.  In a tearful state of depression and heartache, Bride shares with Vane a couple of hours of passion.  That passion marks the start of events that will either bring the two together or leave Vane neutered, that is, if he can survive his enemies.  Have the gods been tinkering with life again?  Can Bride accept the dog in Vane?  Can Vane accept Bride for who she really is?  Will the two survive to even consider a life together?<br /><br />NIGHT PLAY is another action-packed fantasy thriller by Sherrilyn Kenyon.  She continues to conjure up some of the steamiest erotic scenes and incorporates some pulse racing drama that locks readers in and doesn't let them go until the end.  I admit the story surrounding the hero being able to transform into a mythical wolf is a bit farfetched, but I had to remember that this is fantasy where anything is possible.  But what really grounds this book is the heroine, who happens to be a plus-sized, down-to-earth woman with real issues.  I could really identify with her character.

It seems every moral and medical<br /><br />issue is explored in this book. But the trail of dramatic<br /><br />explorations is a bit overwhelming; at times the drama, not<br /><br />the players, drives the story, and this disrupts the pace.<br /><br />Still this is an eye-opening look at the pitfalls that lay<br /><br />in wait for emotions on the rebound. The message I got is<br /><br />whether you are cheating or experimenting, the repercussions<br /><br />came be devastating.<br /><br />Review by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-25

Secret Passion	To the outside world, \\"good girl\\" Charlotte Tasker was the perfect wife, is a perfect mother, and is now a perfect widow. But she has a secret that would shatter her good girl image. Thirteen years ago she had anonymous sex with a man the day before her husband proposed marriage. She knew her husband's plan, but thoughts of him being her only sex partner for the rest of her life terrified her. She thought having a one-day fling with a handsome stranger would satisfy her needs, and then she could be the devoted wife her husband deserved. She became the devoted wife, but she could never rid her mind of the passion she shared with the stranger. On that day, thirteen years ago, Charlotte and the stranger had somehow connected on a deeper level.<br /><br />There's a million dollar price set for DEA agent Joe Bellacera's head to keep him from testifying against a major drug lord. Joe is sent to Minton, Ohio in order to stay alive. The last place Joe wants to be is some two-horse town, but he knows he doesn't have a choice. When he sees his neighbor is the woman who's haunted his dreams for the past thirteen years, things look up. His biggest mistake was allowing her to walk out of his life. She's a widow and not in a relationship presently, so the path should be clear. Yet, he can't pursue her and risk her family's lives. The drug lord who is after him has already murdered his partner and his partner's family.<br /><br />Charlotte can't believe her mystery man has moved next door. At first he brushes off her advances, and she thinks he doesn't feel the same way she does. Later, she uses her guilty feelings and responsibility for her children as a shield against Joe's advances. Once Joe's mind is set, he refuses to walk away again. This time he will win Charlotte's heart.<br /><br />PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION is an entertaining read that kept my attention throughout.

Remember Me?	In Simon Says by Collen Dixon, we met the ruthless Simon Blake, Mayor of Washington D. C.  Alex Baxter, his son-in-law and aid, discovered a seedy side of Simon and his business holdings.  It is a story of power, political intrigue, greed and betrayal.  Alex, a boy from the hood, met Simon's daughter Tiffany in college and the two became friends, protectors and lovers through a series of tragic events. EVERY SHUT EYE by Collen Dixon is the sequel to Simon Says.<br /><br />As the story opens we find Alex and his wife Tiffany Blake Baxter still reeling from the events of a boating accident and the powers that be touting a spin on the misfortune to protect Simon's name. Although EVERY SHUT EYE is the sequel to Simon Says, Dixon penned a second novel, Behind Closed Doors: In My Father's House, which introduces the affluent and mighty Cavanaugh family of Washington D. C. via New York.  This same family plays an integral role in EVERY SHUT EYE, and it is amazing to watch how it all plays out!<br /><br />Dixon is an amazing mystery writer, leaving no stone unturned as the reader navigates through the history of the Blake, Baxter and Cavanaugh families.  Her descriptions of places, things, and peoples' emotions are vivid and uncanny as she introduces and reintroduces some savory and humorous characters.  Dixon also provides thorough information so that EVERY SHUT EYE can stand on its<br /><br />own, but why miss the chance to read Simon Says and Behind Closed Doors: In My Father's House?  They are very good reads and mystery buffs will simply love this series.  Each book gets better and better as more tantalizing information is revealed.

Another Love Story	Watching a TV series premiere is entertaining because it's something new to watch and enjoy, if it's good. However, when the season winds down, you're forced to watch reruns of those shows until the new season begins in the fall.  LUSTING FOR LOVE by Nicoloa McDonald reminds me of a rerun.<br /><br />Meet Celine, your typical young woman who has had unfortunate luck with relationships. She meets Chris and they instantly hit it off to the point of establishing a wonderful relationship.  He knows Celine is the one so he proposes to her. Chris' ex-girlfriend suddenly appears on the scene with some startling news. Not only does he feel betrayed, but he actually falls in the trap of sexual seduction and has a one-night stand with her.<br /><br />Chris knows he made a mistake and tries to find a way to tell Celine. Well, too late, she finds out from an anonymous letter sent to her. And, of course, the story takes a normal turn of events in getting Celine to understand and forgive Chris. Hovering in the background stands another person who is fatally attracted to Celine, which leads up to some detrimental results.<br /><br />Is Chris able to get Celine to forgive him so that they can move on and get married? Does our shady character have other plans?<br /><br />The beginning of the book instantly kept my attention, but as I read on it didn't take long for me to see where this storyline was heading. Therefore, it was easy to figure out pretty much the ending of the story. Although the secondary characters played instrumental parts, it still wasn't enough to help the story along.<br /><br />Overall, LUSTING FOR LOVE by Nicola McDonald comes across as a dime a dozen storyline and left me disappointed.

Definitely drama...	In our everyday lives, most of us have that someone we can lean on, depend on, support and then expect the same things back in return, with no strings attached.  Sammie Davis and Marie Morgan are as different as night and day, but are held together by the bonds of friendship and sisterhood.  Marie Morgan is a single mom separated from her husband and unsure of herself and the path life has her traveling.  On the surface, Sammie is an independent, sanguine, tell-it-like-it-is sister who knows she's all that and flaunts it every chance she gets, but on the inside, she's been a victim so much she's convinced she has to be treated the way she allows the men in her life to treat her.  They both have their share of drama, but in the department of men, it's at an ultimate high.<br /><br />When a man enters into Sammie's life and she's unable to see his true character, Marie comes to her aid, but instead of welcoming her friend's advice and using it to get control of herself, Sammie lashes out.  She becomes threatened by Marie's ability to handle the issues in her life and is outright jealous of her, even though they share the bond of friendship.  One has to ask while reading if she will let a man come between them or if she'll wake up to the reality of the world around her.<br /><br />Marie takes a step back and focuses more on her relationship with a new guy she's met and is convinced he's the perfect man for her, but when things start making her question the relationship, she just might have to once again go back to being alone.  The decisions she makes will not only impact her life, but also those closest to her.<br /><br />ALL THAT DRAMA was a fast-paced, in your face type of read with characters who shared their highs and lows of life, detailing their insecurities, their flaws, and the issues we find in relationships, both with our friends as well as those we're dating.  I will also add that the ending of this book is one that I won't likely forget for a long time.  I first questioned why the prologue was written as it was, but after reading the last page, I understood and applaud McKinney for telling the story the way she did.<br /><br />McKinney writes in a strong, no-holds-barred type of manner that's both witty and hard, yet at the same time emotional and surrounded in reality...a reality so many women face in their relationships.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Tales of Lust	BORN TO LUST by Johnny Archer is a memoir of a man who learns from a very young age that an abundance of sex is his right, and should be gotten by any means necessary.  He never confuses emotions with the raw lust he possesses for the opposite sex.  The author gives us an intimate look at his many sexual escapades.<br /><br />Johnny found girls to be a welcome distraction from being the youngest of five children, born out of wedlock to a father who left them to live in the projects when he was five years old. From the first grade, the reader endures Johnny's experimentations with touching and feeling on young girls.  As he grows older, he engages in sexual acts with little emotion except the manipulation used to get the young girls and later women to sleep with him.  The tales are written from the male prospective, so the encounters range from funny to pure sadness.  The brief emotion of the story comes when Johnny experiences his first love and heartbreak.  It is the heartbreak that enables him to be so callous in his interaction with the opposite sex.  Again love is no longer part of his persona, lust is.<br /><br />This novel is a quick and witty read, however, it lacks the emotional depth one associates with a memoir.  Readers will be so captivated by the unbridled sex they will forget this is the story of a person's life.  BORN TO LUST leaves readers with unanswered questions about the author's life and his choices.  Maybe since he left me gasping at the end, he will continue the story with more than the lustful tales and give readers a more in depth understanding of him as a person.  Most readers will find the tales at least entertaining.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-25
Breaking free	DEPARTURES is a welcomed change from the usual relationship fiction so readily available.  This story takes place in a Philadelphia neighborhood where everyone knows each other and all their personal business.  The cast of characters is a wonderful mix of people who will make you laugh out loud and think pensively.<br /><br />Amber is a ten-year-old girl, who knows without a doubt her mother is going to kill her, because she hates her so much.  As smart as Amber is, she cannot make her mother, Paula love her.  With the pain her mother gives, will Amber be able to find true happiness?<br /><br />Paula has a reputation in her circle of acquaintances.  She considers herself adventuresome, but most consider her to be fast and just a little crazy.  She thinks nothing of using men for money and she definitely doesn't worry about the affects her lifestyle has on her three daughters from three different men.  Yet, she will experience a set back that will change her life and the life of her children.<br /><br />Sheila was so mad at her husband before and after he died, that she does the unthinkable to take out her revenge and to take back her life.  Her husband spent his money gambling and never caring how the bills would be paid.  Unfortunately, it is his gambling that will cause him to lose his life.  For Sheila, it was good riddance and on to a better life.<br /><br />Reba is a mother of six children, a librarian and the wife of a man who doesn't know the meaning of fidelity. When a weekend trip takes her away from her deadbeat husband and children, she discovers what she has been missing.  Upon her return home, the whole house is in for some real changes.<br /><br />There are many more characters from the neighborhood.  Readers will meet a cast they will immediately recognize; they have characteristics of people you know.  The characters are funny, spontaneous and very real.  I would be laughing out loud one minute and shaking my head the next with all the antics these women and men take on in order to break free of lives that are filled with infidelity, loneliness, fear and low self-esteem.  I enjoyed the story, but I found I liked certain characters more than others.  It was the lesser characters that made the flow of the novel somewhat slow, but it is the antics of the main characters that keep you reading.  Even with the multitude of characters, each one is distinctive and helped to create a unique story.  The story illustrates the ability of people to grow, be free and to evolve.

Payback	Pampered, arrogant, self-centered Meena lives a picture-perfect life with her husband, Justin, and baby girl, Simone. She can't understand why Justin has tolerated her often times nasty attitude and knows he is a good man and deserves to be treated better. Events from her past haunt her, keeping her from completely opening her heart. When she receives a call from someone out of her past, she realizes how much she loves and appreciates her family, and now they are all in danger. She reveals the whole truth of her sordid history to her husband, praying he understands. <br /> <br />Basilah served ten years in prison, dreaming of the day when she'd be free to extract her vengeance on Meena. Years ago when Meena's boyfriend dumped her for a white girl, Basilah was the one to focus Meena's energies on becoming a stronger woman. And how did Meena show her gratitude, she betrayed Basilah. Now that Basilah has served her time, it's time to pay her \\"good ol' friend\\" Meena a visit.  <br /> <br />Chandra Adams did an excellent job of developing Basilah. Watching Basilah mature from a nave teen to a psycho adult saddened me. Adams' execution of Basilah was flawless and I'd give this portion of the book a 5 rating. Unfortunately, Meena's character was not well developed and the plot behind her history was too far fetched and snatched away much of my enjoyment of the book. There were also a few secondary characters and subplots that should have been cut. I like Chandra Adams' writing style; I can tell she is a good writer by her Basilah plot. Though SHADES OF RETRIBUTION is not one of my favorite books, I do look forward to Ms. Adams' future works. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2004-10-25
First love is unforgettable	Nine years ago, Samantha Marconi and Jeff Hendricks met, fell in love and after a brief courtship they married over the objections of both families. The brief honeymoon period was filled with so many arguments that eventually Jeff left a few weeks later for a business trip never to return.  Despite attempts to contact him, Sam found herself in a very untenable situation: pregnant and alone.  She felt she had no choice but to return home, put the child up for adoption and try to live her life as normal as possible, that is until Jeff knocks on her door.<br /><br />In AND THEN CAME YOU, it is nine years later when Jeff arrives in Chandler, California, to inform Sam that their divorce was never finalized.  She also learns that Jeff raised the daughter she thought she gave up all those years ago. Accusations start to fly as they figure out what really happened.  The bottom line-Jeff's mother, Eleanor, interfered to keep the two apart.  However, Jeff is getting married in a few weeks and he really needs Sam to sign those papers.  Sam has met her daughter and now she is interested in spending time with her.  Jeff's fiance, Cynthia, is bound and determined to marry him. What none of them bargain for is that Jeff and Sam have not forgotten that they were each other's first loves, and those feelings are still simmering just beneath the surface.<br /><br />Maureen Child has written a very interesting and heartwarming love story peppered with a good bit of humor and an education about family sticking together.  Her characters are real and very believable.  She adds the cast of the Marconi family, a very lively and raucous group, to spice up what could have been just another ordinary love story.  Each of Sam's sisters is interesting and adds much to her story.  I for one would be very interested in reading their stories.  AND THEN CAME YOU is touted as the first in a trilogy about the Marconi sisters and I'm waiting for the next installment.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Is It Worth It?	Have you ever made New Year's Resolutions? If so, were you able to keep them? Or did you find yourself giving up after only a couple of days or weeks? FLIPPIN' THE SCRIPT by Aisha Ford delves into not only making New Year's Resolutions but actually keeping them for a year. Imagine not only keeping the resolutions but being watched by cameras and on a daily talk show to ensure you keep them. Not sure if I could do it, could you?<br /><br />Sabrina Bradley is the assistant to the assistant producer at a well-known daytime talk show called The Daily Dose. Fresh out of a dead-end relationship and attempting to get a promotion from the show's host, Darci Oliver, Sabrina is indeed stressed out. Sabrina decides to make some positive changes regarding her life and writes down some New Year's Resolutions.  Darci inadvertently gets her hands on a copy of Sabrina's resolutions and assures her that if she makes the resolutions public via the talk show and agrees to keep them for a year, not only will Darci grant her a promotion but she will also receive a big bonus check. Although Sabrina knows how bad she wants the promotion and could use the extra money, is she willing to be followed for a year via the show? She agrees to the deal in an effort to prove she can keep her resolutions and that she is as strong as God's word says she is.<br /><br />Being watched 24/7 is not an easy task. Shortly after making her resolutions on air, she isn't able to go anywhere without being recognized and asked how she is doing in keeping her resolutions. All Sabrina wants is to make it through the year while growing closer to God. She soon becomes the topic of various tabloid magazines, and while needing a listening ear, she finds the show's producer Avery Benjamin is not only attentive, fine and a great listener, he is also Darci's finance'. Sabrina realizes that God is all she has when times get tough and in an effort to strengthen her faith recognizes that she can do all things through Christ who strengthens her.<br /><br />Light-hearted, entertaining and funny, FLIPPIN' THE SCRIPT is indeed a page turner.  Seeing Sabrina's perseverance and determination to reach her goals, made me want to strive harder to achieve mine. What I enjoyed most about the book was how strong  Sabrina was in her faith. She knew without a doubt that she couldn't do anything without God on her side.

Success is within your grasp	How do I define my own personal success? What are the obstacles keeping me from succeeding? How do I get around, through, under, or over goal crushing obstacles? How do I start down the path of success? Is there a road map to help guide me down the road to success? These are just a few of the questions answered in THE TWELVE UNIVERSAL LAWS OF SUCCESS by Herbert Harris.<br /><br />Using a combination of self-help concepts, biblical principles, and step-by-step procedures, Mr. Harris has written a well-organized, easy to understand guide to escort readers through the laws of success. Throughout each chapter, thought provoking questions are asked of the readers to help them focus on where they are, where they wish to go, and how to get there.<br /><br />Currently the target audience for this book is adults that are doing well in life but want to do better. I believe the primary target audience should be changed to teens and young adults. The first lesson Mr. Harris teaches is about poor self-image and how to overcome this barrier to success. The subsequent lessons are just as relevant to teens and young adult's lives. Why not teach young people how to succeed before they've been out in the world using the trial and error method?<br /><br />Mr. Harris's no nonsense, cut to the chase approach in THE TWELVE UNIVERSAL LAWS OF SUCCESS made this an easy read that I believe many will find beneficial.  I even plan on having my teens work through the book as their summer project.<br /><br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-25
El Barrio Yesterday and Today	CHANGO'S FIRE by Ernesto Quinonez showcases several individuals and their lives in New York City's Spanish Harlem.  The main characters highlighted are Julio, Maritza and Helen.  Told through Julio, we receive a distinct, informational and gritty tale that boasts serious social commentary.<br /><br />Julio is involved in an insurance scam; he is an arsonist and attends college in the evenings.  Working for an Italian immigrant left over in Spanish Harlem from the 1970's, Julio sets properties on fire in and around New York City.  It started out with private properties and quickly developed into properties in the name of gentrification, urban renewal and planned shrinkage.  Maritza is the pastor of the First People Church of God and social activist of the neighborhood.  In Julio's words, she services \\"the greatest collection of misfits, sinners and freaks.\\"  She sells dreams in the form of illegal United States citizenship papers, but only to a select few.  Helen is a transplant from a Wisconsin farming community whose parents attended Cornell University.  Helen's dream was to leave Wisconsin for New York City to revel in all New York has to offer.  She arrives in Spa Ha, as part owner of an art gallery. Julio and Helen own their apartments in the same building while Maritza's church is located in the third apartment.  What occurs with the mixing of urban professional whites and immigrant Spaniards, who have claimed this area of NYC as their own, is the catalyst of this story.<br /><br />Quinonez weaves this fire with excellent visualization, utilizing the emotional torment of the characters.  Julio's voice is powerful and unyielding.  Maritza's righteousness appears charitable, but Quinonez delves deep into her character exposing a woman that you either admire or loathe.  And finally, we come to know Helen not only through Julio's voice, but also through the letters she writes to Julio; honest letters citing her lack of understanding and her willingness to learn.  At times my heart went out to her while empathizing with the residents of this neighborhood and their economic plight.<br /><br />Erupting and quelling this fire simultaneously is the mixture of religious and spiritual themes; this is where we meet Chango.  Sprinkle in the subtle romance theme with the suspense and Quinonez has ignited a flame so strong that it may never die.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Classic divas	Slim Lambright first won me over with her debut novel, The Justus Girls, when she brought the multiple protagonists to life and gave them their own voices and styles. Lambright revisits this theme in her sophomore release THE SWEETHEARTS OF SOUL, the story of a female singing group comprised of sisters, each of whom are very much her own woman.<br /><br />When the Sweethearts of Soul are honored with a prestigous award, reporter Legs Diamond is charged with telling the real story of this famous group for a prominent music magazine.  Legs knows that there is a lot of speculation surrounding the lives of Venus, Ruth, Fluffy, Addie, and Birdie, but she really has no idea as to the multitude of both stories the women are willing to openly share and the stories that they refuse to disclose.  Narrated by Legs, the book flows through time with both blasts from the past and harsh truths from the present. While invloved in these interviewing ups and downs, Legs forms a bond with the women and finds out what sisterhood is all about.<br /><br />Evelyn \\"Slim\\" Lambright is one of the best when it comes to lovable characters and exceptional stories. She weaves fun and exciting, yet poignant, tales about characters who we may or may not relate to directly, but people we have perhaps once known or wished we knew. For those readers who enjoyed her first effort, it is doubtful that you will be disappointed by her second.

Diamond Drought	DIAMOND DROUGHT by Brandon McCalla is the debut novel of the hip-hop crime drama, Diamond Series. Set amidst the rappers, thugs, drug dealers' way of life, the intensity and realization is very evident.  The story centers on Rich who is a drug dealing, wannabe rapper producer trying to break into the music industry. His boys, who are also his partners in crime, oversee the lucrative drug trade. They make no bones about sporting all their profits with clothes, jewelry and flashy cars. He meets mystery woman, Shantel, a music producer who has a hidden agenda to seduce Rich, among other things. Rich also has a rival from the past who wants to see him dead. So begins the saga of Rich, his homies, and his enemies.<br /><br />Leaya, Rich's insecure woman, employs her best girlfriend to keep an eye on her man, which leads to more drama and confrontations of sorts during the course of the story. With multiple dramas and scheming among the first and secondary characters, the suspense builds up to serious double-crossing and tragedy, but it doesn't end there.<br /><br />DIAMOND DROUGHT is without doubt written for the hip-hop generation. However, for me it contained excessive foul language, meaningless slang terms along with rapping verses depicting the degradation of women. Additionally, the constant clothing designers labels mentioned throughout the story, the detailed description of each character's ride and the \\" bling bling\\" jewelry caused me to lose touch with the story several times.  The story has potential, but I feel the author overplayed the hip-hop indignations. Since the characters were just that, characters, I wanted to shake the author and stuff his mouth with soap because he has a good storyline, but it needs more literary work.<br /><br />And finally, what truly bothered me the most was the author's dedication at the beginning of the book. This section is normally reserved for thanking people who have been instrumental in supporting the author, which he does. But, he then states in the last sentence, \\"buy my &#60;expletive&#62; book.\\" I thought this was in poor taste.  If you put too much sugar in your coffee, it's destined to lose its taste.

Love at first sight	It was predicted that the Westmoreland children would all find love at first sight.  That is not going to be the case for avowed bachelor, Stone Westmoreland, in STONE COLD SURRENDER. In this fourth installment of the Westmoreland series, Stone is following in his Uncle Corey Westmoreland's footsteps--a bachelor to the end.  Uncle Corey has an entire mountain to himself and has declared it off limits to women.  Both men are affirmed bachelors until the Winters' women step into their lives.<br /><br />After a very sensual take-off from Atlanta to Montana, Madison Winters meets Stone. In a very short time, the two realize an instant attraction that simmers on the edge of each one's consciousness.  Madison, a schoolteacher from Boston, is on a mission to find her mom and bring her home or at the least find out what's gotten into her.  Abby Winters is acting in a fashion very uncharacteristic of a widow and mother in her daughter's eye, and it is especially worrisome because a man is involved.<br /><br />Stone becomes completely enchanted with Madison, but he doesn't want to admit it.  He likes bachelorhood and doesn't want to make a serious commitment, or so he thinks.  When he realizes that Madison is somewhat inexperienced in the feelings of love and passion, he makes it his business to guide her through the discovery while helping her to locate her mother.  Once they find Abby, their perceptions about love and life may change considerably.<br /><br />Silhouette novels were always a favorite of mine in my youthful days, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why I gave them up, especially, after reading STONE COLD SURRENDER.  Brenda Jackson is a great romance writer.  Montana is not the most romantic place that I can think of, but add a couple of sensual individuals and Ms. Jackson's writing abilities and you have a wonderful and heartwarming love story that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling all over.

The Essence of Forgiveness	To forgive or not to forgive? That is the question. Relationships are built on trust; if that trust is broken the relationship may or may not survive. The ability to forgive can determine if a relationship will weather the storm. In PERILS OF THE HEART: Faith, Love, Trust and Forgiveness by K. Patrick Abrams, love, faith and trust are tested but will the parties involved be willing to forgive and their relationships able to stand the test of time?<br /><br />Miles and Tyler Stewart have been married for five years. They have no children and are happily in love. Miles is the typical Don Juan, always romancing his wife and making sure she knows just how special she is to him. A brief encounter from his past comes back to haunt him and he does his best to not have it resurface. Tyler undoubtedly loves her husband and can't imagine life without him, until she stumbles across something suspicious that leads her to her biggest fear. Their relationship takes a turn for the worse and the happily in love is no more. Can they get their happily ever after back? Or will they remain estranged? Forgiveness is the key but it's not as easy at it seems.<br /><br />Franklin and Clarissa are married but separated and have two daughters. Franklin has a skeleton in his closet that resurfaces in his bedroom and inadvertently causes him and Clarissa to part ways. Clarissa feels betrayed and can't believe what her husband has done to her and her family but the truth,  as she knows it is actually a lie that changed her marriage. In an effort to get back with Clarissa, Franklin attempts to make peace with his past. Is it to late for their relationship to overcome the broken trust? Or will they have the ability to forgive and reunite their family?<br /><br />If someone has ever betrayed you and you found it hard to forgive them then you can definitely relate to PERILS OF THE HEART. Nothing hurts more than having someone you care about deceive you. But if you are able to get past it and forgive them for their wrongdoing, you become the bigger person and are more at peace. It use to be difficult for me to forgive, but once I realized not to sweat the small stuff and that my inability to forgive was more harmful than good, I mastered the art of forgiveness and became a much happier person.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Daddy Where Are You?	In this day and age there are many single parent families. As the mothers work several jobs to maintain the household and raise the children, the fathers are nowhere to be found. There are some households where the fathers are physically there but not emotionally, mentally, spiritually or financially. ROBBING PETER by Kia Dupree delves into the lives of three women whose lives are very different, but who end up being connected as their city of Washington, DC is terrorized.<br /><br />Vivica Jeffries is a single mother of five children. Vivica married her high school sweetheart, Eddie at a very young age. They began having children right away and shortly thereafter, Eddie became addicted to crack. After being physically abused one too many times Vivica kicks Eddie out and is forced to raise her five children alone. She has a set of twins, Elgin and Elijah, Evan, Eric and Eve. With virtually no education Vivica struggles to go back to school, hold down a job and raise her children. In an effort to give her children the best, she ends up being away from home more than she is at home and in essence the kids are raising themselves. While Elgin and Elijah are terrorizing several communities in the DC area and bullying the younger kids at home, Vivica has her hands full.<br /><br />Belinda Maxwell, a family-court judge, is single and has no children. She is very successful in her career but unsuccessful in love. Belinda finds it hard to understand how her mother can wait on her father hand and foot when he refuses to do anything beyond his disability to care for himself. After an accident that caused him to become disabled and confined to a wheelchair he virtually has done nothing for himself, although he could if he wanted to. Belinda is finding herself being submissive and nurturing to the men she dates, and she begins to lose her sense of self. To complicate matters even more she gets involved with a married man. Belinda wonders if her father was more active after his accident would she be a different person towards the men she dates.<br /><br />Iralaun Fugere is a college student who has never known her father and doesn't even know his name. Growing up she was taught not to trust or fall in love with men, but to basically get what you can and be gone. This works well for Iralaun until she meets and falls head over heels for Allen who is nothing like the losers she previously has been with. Allen is kind, considerate and understanding. Will Iralaun let her guard down or will she continue to get what she wants and be out?<br /><br />Full of twists and turns and a heart wrenching surprise ending ROBBING PETER is definitely a book that needs to be read. See how women of all walks of life are connected in more ways than specifically an absentee father. The characters are very well developed and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I cried, yelled and laughed with the characters and found myself asking where ARE the fathers?<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

The heart of a troubled man	When you pick up this book, fasten your seat belts because you will embark on another fantastic journey by Rique Johnson in WHISPERS FROM A TROUBLED HEART.  Officer Jason Jerrard is down but not quite out, as he battles his way back from despair, heartache, loss and a battle weary spirit.  After the burial of his beloved Sasha, he vows never to love again. But, remember the saying, \\"never say never.\\"<br /><br />In his favorite restaurant, Jason meets a beautiful mysterious woman, where an instant and mutual attraction develops.  He later finds out that this mysterious woman is none other than the wife of Virginia City's Mayor, who is running for re-election.  Also, a woman from his past reappears in the form of Monique, who happens to be his first love.  Both women believe they are truly in love with Jason and want his love in return.<br /><br />As these two women vie for his affection, Jason finds himself assigned to a case where men are being beaten to death.  When his friend Alfredo is beaten and left for dead, he makes it his business to find the culprit, with a warning from the Captain to do it by the book.  The Captain's warning comes a little late as Jason faces off with the suspect and meets a challenge worse than he had anticipated.  When this is over, will Jason's job remain in tact?  Will he lose a chance at love again?<br /><br />This novel is a sequel to Love and Justice and it doesn't disappoint.  In fact, the action seems to keep rolling right along without a lull between novels.  The masterfully done twists and turns as well as the steamy sex scenes will have you glued to the pages until finished.  As his beloved Sasha speaks to his heart to guide him through his misery and pain, past rage and resentment, I saw emerge a stronger but very lovable hero in Officer Jerrard.  This very troubled man battled from the depths of despair to not only love again, but also continue to fight crime in his city.  He showed that even in heartache there is a blessing.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerss a blessing.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Do You Believe?	What would you do if you were given the gift to heal sickness and disease? Would you use your gift for a profit? Would you be embarrassed and not tell anyone for fear of being made fun of? Or would you be proud of your God given gift and go around the world healing those in need, in the name of Jesus?  HEALERS by Ronnie Mills is the compilation of three short stories of everyday ordinary people who have been given the gift of healing. How they choose to use their gift will change their lives dramatically.<br /><br />In The Gangster and The Gift, Robert James, Jr., a newly initiated gang member, has been given the power to heal. Though not a religious man, he is the son of a former crippled Pastor. The relationship between Robert and his father has gone awry due to Robert's chosen lifestyle. After receiving the gift,  he realizes the life he is living is not the path he wants to continue to follow. The only way out of the gang is by death,  and Robert has to choose whom he will serve, his gang or his God. What choice will Robert make? What choice would you make?<br /><br />In Good Intentions, Reverend Lincoln Hightower, a poor, warm-hearted, humble man has been given the power to heal. His church has no money and most of his congregation is leaving to go to a bigger, and more powerful church. With his newly found gift, Lincoln feels he is sitting on a gold mine. Will he use his gift for the uplifting of God's kingdom? Or will he chose to use it for his own selfish desires?<br /><br />In Only Women Bleed, Marlene Evans, a married mother of two daughters,  is in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. She married her high school sweetheart, who had a promising career in basketball after graduation. But after he endured an injury,  his whole persona changed for the worst. Marlene has taken one too many beatings and has finally decided to leave her husband. She and her two daughters move back in with her mom and begin life anew. Marlene is given the power to heal and can't understand why God would give such a power to an ordinary woman as herself. Will Marlene use her gift to heal her husband and get back the love they once had? Or has she suffered enough abuse and will continue to start a new life without him?<br /><br />HEALERS is an inspirational and uplifting novel that really causes you to evaluate if there are truly those given the power to heal in this day and age. Jesus gave his disciples the power to cure all illness and disease so why wouldn't someone today be granted that same gift? I thought about how my life would be affected if I were given a special gift such as the power to heal. What I enjoyed most about the book was how it depicted everyday people who may or may not have been believers in Jesus Christ, but who were given a special gift that made them realize there is a God and He is there for everyone.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

Animal Riddles	SHANNA'S ANIMAL RIDDLES is a wonderful book for children learning to read.  It is filled with color recognition, rhyming words, picture clues, and repetitive words to assist in identifying what's happening in the story.<br /><br />ANIMAL RIDDLES is one of the books in the First Reader Series and introduces the young reader to cats, dogs, and other animals.  The images are bright and colorful and Shanna is shown in various costumes to help in determining each animal.  This is an adorable read, both entertaining and educational, one that I'd recommend to schools, libraries, parents, and other entities responsible for teaching children.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Bear Hunt	Shanna is back with the crew:  Shane, Tiger, Dinah, and Ducky to take children on a bear hunt.  Dressed in hats and backpacks, they set out on their journey throughout the various rooms of the house in search of the bear.<br /><br />The story utilizes tools of all the First Reader Series:  rhyme and rhythm, sight words, picture clues, phonics games, easy words, and large print.  Each of these tools adds to the appeal of the story and assists in the early reading development of children.  In addition, the author has done a great job of showcasing Shanna's house and what's included in each room.<br /><br />This is yet another story to add to reading lists everywhere, especially for those with young children who love reading out loud or being read to.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

God is on the job even at the workplace	God's benevolent blessings should abound in all things, even the job.  There are days when even getting up to go work can be drudgery because of all the little pitfalls Satan has in store for us.  THE WALK AT WORK: SEVEN STEPS TO SPIRITUAL SUCCESS ON THE JOB is a guidebook that will help fight Satan and avoid his pitfalls in the workplace.  This guide is a seven-month, day-by-day devotional for the workweek to develop personal spiritual growth on the job as well as aligning one's professional priorities with God's plan.  Putting on the whole armor of God takes on new meaning in this guidebook when we apply it to our professional walk. If corporate America could apply a few of the principles discussed in this guide, there would be no need to invest in training for such things as stress and anger management, conflict resolution, and how to get along in the workplace.<br /><br />Andria Hall divides her guide into seven chapters or seven S.U.C.C.E.S.S. steps.  Each step stands for a letter in the acronym of S.U.C.C.E.S.S.  Written in first person, the chapters begin with a detailed exploration of each step, along with some practical applications, journal exercises and a prayer for the month.  The day's devotional covers a specific topic and provides a scripture, discussion and an action point to apply for the day.  Each topic is relevant and directly tied to aspects of the workplace.<br /><br />Ms. Hall has put together what has to be the most inspirational book for the workplace that I have seen in a while.  I have found this guide to be a true roadmap to spiritual success in the workplace.  It provides specific steps on how to incorporate your professional world in your spiritual world.  Ms. Hall shares that our spiritual lives shouldn't stop on Sunday evening just before we return to work on Monday, but it should continue throughout the workweek.  God expects us to be about His business even on our jobs.  This guide is an awesome experience and I encourage everyone to try S.U.C.C.E.S.S.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The Big Day	FLOWER GIRL BUTTERFLIES tells all about Sarah's preparations to be a flower girl in her Aunt Robin's wedding.  She picks out her dress, prepares for visiting family, and attends the wedding rehearsal.  Throughout all of these experiences she shares her feelings, at times she is excited and at others she is very nervous.  When the big day arrives will she be ready?<br /><br />Little girls in particular are sure to enjoy this book.  The illustrations for the story are absolutely beautiful and really complement the story well.  I also enjoyed the fact that Sarah shared her feelings; she described what she was feeling and then labeled it.  This modeling is an excellent way for young readers to learn to identify and label their own feelings.  However, there was no build up in anticipation of the big wedding day and as a result, the story lacks excitement and read more like a \\"to do\\" list for flower girls at times.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Outcasts	Scott Walker was born in the James Fort Settlement in 1622. His mother died while he was young and his father was so distraught that he turned from his son and basically let him raise himself. Seeking companionship, Scott ventured into the wilderness and made friends with Falling Feather who taught him how to hunt and survive in the harsh wilderness. Soon, an unfortunate accident that happened while the two were hunting forced Scott to flee for his life. On his journey away from danger, he ran across a young woman of the Shawnee people who had been kidnapped and injured by the Seneca. He nursed her back to health and they began to travel together, watching for hostile animals and people. At a village where they stopped for a short time, Man-with-no-hair joined them. They became a family of sorts. Scott and the woman, Dew-on-the-grass-in-the-moon-when-the-leaves-fall, fell in love and produced a child, Sky Eyes. Man-with-no-hair left them while she was pregnant because his beloved wife died in childbirth and he couldn't bear the suspense of waiting to see if Scott's woman would survive.<br /><br />The adventures that these three people share will leave you frightened, chilled, and finally peaceful. Gorbett has a way with words that brings the two worlds of Indians and Whites into stunning reality as they learn each other's language and culture. He shows how people of different backgrounds, religions and colors can live in peace. He also imparts several subtle lessons on greed, taking care of and protecting our natural resources and above all, love. I would highly recommend this book, especially for those who care about and appreciate the great outdoors.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Love's Passion	EROTIC ANTHOLOGY is a very engaging duo of love stories with highly charged  eroticism.  Though graphic in nature, these stories are about a lot more than sex.<br /><br />The first story, Flame, is about Samara Templeton, a sensuous and sophisticated accountant who does reviews for a women's magazine.  When she does an adverse review on author Devlin Devoe's novel, he takes it personally and decides to confront her about it.  When he meets the tantalizing object of his ire, a spark ignites between the two that turns into a conflagration that threatens to consume them both.<br /><br />The second installment, Discovering Ava, tells the story of Jillian Walters, an author of erotica who hides her smoldering passions behind the dour facade of a prudish, efficient secretary.  When Gavin, her gorgeous hunk of a boss whom she has secretly desired for five years, accidentally discovers one of her sizzling manuscripts, he is overcome with curiosity.  He follows her to a night club, where he gives in to a voyeuristic urge and ends up viewing her sexual prowess first hand. Now Gavin is determined to have this sexy siren for himself.<br /><br />EROTIC ANTHOLOGY is not your typical book of erotic stories as the title seems to suggest.  It is actually two very well written love stories with enticing plots and personable characters, plus the added bonus of steamy sex scenes.  Lovers of romantic eroticism will find this book is well worth the read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Fun Stories with Great Messages	A PRIDE OF AFRICAN TALES is a collection of folktales which have their roots in several West African nations including Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria.  Each story is preceded by a brief introduction which gives readers a little background on the history and origin of the particular tale.  Although I enjoyed all of the stories in the collection, my two favorites were \\"Shansa Mutoungo Shima\\" and \\"The Roof of Leaves.\\"  \\"Shansa Mutoungo Shima\\" tells the story of Bwalya, a young woman who learns an important lesson about judging people by the way they look.  In \\"The Roof of Leaves\\" a married couple has an argument followed by a misunderstanding, and both of them must learn an important lesson about swallowing their pride and more importantly about forgiveness.<br /><br />In the introduction, author Donna L. Washington states that the stories which make up this collection are meant to be told not read, and she encourages readers to bring the stories to life.  This book is a \\"must have\\" for any child's library, as it is the type of book that can be read over and over again.  The book is well organized and the stories are diverse and will appeal to both boys and girls.  Washington has compiled a wonderful collection which pairs West African Folktales with a splash of history.  Additional resources are provided at the end of the book for readers wanting to learn more about the origins of a particular story and for further reading.  James Ransome's eye-catching illustrations add yet another dimension to this collection, and I was impressed by the way the illustrations for each story were consistent with the setting in which it took place.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
A rose by any other name	A rose by any other name<br /><br />ONE MAN'S CASTLE is an all too familiar story about victimization simply because of the color of someone's skin. Phyllis Vines<br /><br />reconstructs a suspenseful detective story that heralds a collision between a Black physician and the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />Dr. Ossian Sweet journeyed to Paris, France to study medicine under the supervision of Madame Curie. At that stage of his life, Sweet has reached all of his goals; attended the right schools, received a medical degree that would guarantee him financial and social prominence, and had married well. But when he and his wife arrive at the American hospital in Paris to deliver their first child, they are turned away. And seemingly for the first time Sweet realizes he is not protected from the opprobrium of racism. Racism is not new to Sweet, he is a son of the south, but his previous racial encounters were impersonal to him. However, after hearing the words of the American Ambassador, that 'the hospital is operating in the spirit of America', things change for Sweet. This time racism carries a personal tag, as if Jim Crow had searched for him and targeted his sense of masculinity.<br /><br />The Sweets return to the states and acquire lodging in a fairly affluent section of Detroit, Michigan. But this is an America still wallowing in the bowels of racial disparity. The Sweets become victims of racial slurs, physical attacks on their home, and blatant indifference from the local police authorities. Amid the volatile confrontations between the racial groups someone is killed and all of the occupants of Sweet's home are jailed.<br /><br />This extensively researched and tartly presented tragedy of Dr. Ossian Sweet's efforts to reside in a home he purchased in an all-white Detroitneighborhood introduces a colorful cast of characters and a wide range of social history. Because Detroit's population described their city as one of the most metropolitan cities in the world, the tension between Blacks and whites was supposedly manageable, but the events in 1925 changed that perception. The NAACP was compelled to hire famed lawyer Clarence Darrow, which led to one of the most incendiary courtroom dramas in the history of the United States. This is a remarkable book about our obsession with race. It reads like a thriller, except this story is true.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersnsion between Blacks and whites was supposedly manageable, but the events in 1925 changed that perception.

For the love of money	A lot of people have big dreams of winning the lottery and moving on to bigger and better things in life.  In A DOLLAR AND A DREAM, authors Carl Weber, Angel Hunter, Dwayne S. Joseph, and La Jill Hunt combine forces to present a collection of three stories with the main focus on money, greed, and how both can change your life and those around you.  Though similar, each story is quite different and brings various perspectives on the drama people can get into all for the love of money.<br /><br />In \\"Easy Street,\\" La Jill Hunt & Carl Weber share the story of residents of an apartment building, all suffering hard times.  From the owner who is about to lose the building, to a beautiful gold-digger out to get all she can from men, and on to a bum, we see a range of personalities.  Each has an agenda and motive and we're able to see how honor and integrity plays into this story.  When one of the residents announces he's won the lottery...the stage is set for major drama.  I really enjoyed this story and the lesson I drew from it.<br /><br />\\"Ghetto Fabulous,\\" by Angel Hunter, introduces us to a reformed drug-addict and single mother trying to support her three children, with not much assistance from the three fathers.  She has someone new in her life, but she's barely making ends meet.  Winning the lottery would certainly make things better for her and her children.  The writing in this story wasn't as tight as I would've liked and at the end I was left feeling as if the story was closed too abruptly, but it did help me to see the determination a person can have when they have the desire to strive for what they want versus giving up when life throws them curve balls.<br /><br />Dwayne S. Joseph flips the script in \\"One Night, Six Dreams\\" with an extreme case of what people will do to have it all.  When a group of co-workers get together to buy lottery tickets, no one suspects that the person assigned to pick up the tickets will disappear.  Yet, our main character decides that all of the money is better than splitting it six ways.  The night turns into a bizarre journey of chaos and destruction.  Fast-paced and quite unrealistic, I enjoyed this story, but felt it would've been even more enjoyable if things hadn't transpired so quickly.  There just seemed to be too much chaos in one night, but of the three, this was my favorite as it shows the darkness that sometimes hide behind the masks that many wear daily.<br /><br />Since these were short stories, there wasn't really much to glean from many of the characters and the plot was the same for each story.  Collectively, the stories did well in showcasing what a person would do for a dollar and a dream.  In a few places, I thought the protagonists acted out of character and in one, there was unnecessary drama, but overall, it was an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Criss Cross or the Double Cross?	This novel to me is a cross between Dallas the television show and New Jack City the movie.  It has the elements of over the top riches, drama and behavior straight from the hood.  THE CRISS CROSS will have your undivided attention as you sort through murder, sex, lies, videotape, drugs and so much more.  And it is the more that keeps you reading.<br /><br />Nikki Ling is an exotic beauty who possesses the features of her Japanese mother and African-American father.  She also has lived a difficult life and has only wanted to make sure her sister never suffers.  Noki Ling is Nikki's selfish sister, who doesn't embrace her African-American heritage and walks around speaking Japanese and denying the very sister who has sacrificed for her.  Kapri Henderson is a ride or die chick who will do anything for her man.  So if she has to do time for him, so be it because she is not going to snitch on him.  Finally, there is Ivanka Zamora who is a very rich psychopath.  The author has readers guessing on how these four women's lives intertwine.  Are they all part of the criss cross or the double cross?<br /><br />THE CRISS CROSS is an entertaining read to say the least.  It will keep you guessing.  There are a myriad of characters from different racial and economic backgrounds.  Readers should be prepared for the unexpected with this novel.  This story is the sequel to the author's first novel, \\"Life, Love & Loneliness\\".  Those who have read the previous novel will recognize some of the characters.  However, this was my first foray reading anything by Crystal Lacey Winslow, which made it difficult at times to follow the story because the former storylines and plots were incorporated with little background from the first novel.  If readers are not dogged by needing to know what happen previously, this novel will stand on its own.  I personally found it a bit confusing.  One other thing to point out is there are many characters who will easily appear and disappear so only the main characters are fleshed out.  This is an enjoyable read but I would recommend readers who have not read the first novel to check that one out first.

His main concern was that he would never measure up to<br /><br />the standards of his best friend, Charity and her four cliquish friends.<br /><br />Keelan and Charity had been friends since kindergarten, and although<br /><br />her friends, the `Cutie Pies', disapproved of her association with<br /><br />him, Charity would not sever their friendship.<br /><br />Now the Cutie Pies were a story in their own right, their uppity<br /><br />attitude alienated most of the students, and made enemies of the<br /><br />others. They were never held accountable for the vicious pranks they<br /><br />played in high school.<br /><br />Fast forward ten years, preparations are in place for their ten years<br /><br />class reunion. The affair will be held aboard a cruise line headed by<br /><br />Keelan. Each of the attendees is carrying baggage from their past, but<br /><br />they show no significant changes in their appearances or personalities.<br /><br />The one exception is Keelan, he has lost all semblance to the nerdy<br /><br />boy they remembered. Now most of the ladies have eyes for him, but<br /><br />Keelan still has a crush on Charity. When the two finally reunite, an<br /><br />attraction is unearthed between them. Before they can pursue their<br /><br />feelings, Keelan is confronted with a serious problem. Someone is out<br /><br />for revenge against the four friends. One by one each of them is<br /><br />involved in a freakish accident. Keelan knows he must protect Charity<br /><br />and find the culprit if he wants to fulfill his fantasy.<br /><br />Angie Daniels is a chronic daydreamer, and loves a good page-turner.<br /><br />She has created an intriguing story of passion, romance, and revenge on<br /><br />the high seas. This story brings back memories of school days.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
If you can't stand the heat	UNFORGETTABLE is almost the classic ugly duckling to beautiful swan<br /><br />story. The heroine does not turn into a beautiful swan, but she does<br /><br />become quite a lovely duckling.<br /><br />For years Anna Prescott, a full figured woman, has hidden behind<br /><br />her catering business and her unflattering wardrobe. She has<br /><br />always had a crush on Gavin, her brother's best friend, but has never<br /><br />spoken about it because he is almost family. Also, Anna has met all<br /><br />of Gavin's love interests and they are tall, thin, and a<br /><br />little mentally distracted. Since she is the complete opposite<br /><br />of his dates, she rules out a relationship and decides to do<br /><br />something for herself. Gavin, a professional football player for<br /><br />the Detroit Lions, is unaware of Anna's affection; he sees her<br /><br />as the sister he never had.<br /><br />About the time of Anna's transformation, Gavin seeks her help with<br /><br />a family emergency. Although she was not trying to get Gavin's<br /><br />attention, for the first time he sees her as a sexy woman, and this<br /><br />creates problems for him. Gavin has to remind himself that she is part<br /><br />of his extended family, and for a very personal reason, he is afraid<br /><br />of a commitment. But Gavin is jealous of whomever has caused the<br /><br />change in Anna. Feeling anxious about the reason for her change, but<br /><br />afraid to ask who caused it, has Gavin tied in knots. Will he throw<br /><br />consequences to the wind and listen to his heart?<br /><br />Ms. Ford aptly uses her gift of sharing human stories, with sports<br /><br />figures as the catalyst, to entertain readers. As she did with<br /><br />my personal favorite AFTER DARK, she has written a tender story that<br /><br />generates sparks, spice and physical excitement. This one answers<br /><br />the question, who needs love?  READ IT.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
New Age Nursery Rhymes	Michelle Washington brings a fresh new voice to the nearly timeless tradition of nursery rhymes in her book, A TREASURY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ABC'S AND NURSERY RHYMES FOR CHILDREN.  In this collection, she presents readers with a vast collection that children are sure to enjoy.  In the ABC's section, each letter is presented with an easy to remember line that reflects the rich cultural heritage of African Americans, such as \\"P is for the pride blacks wear to cherish their true worth.\\"  The section on the numbers one through twenty shows the actual number along with pictures of a young girl jumping rope that parents and children can count together.  In the nursery rhyme section, the author presents fresh new rhymes that are current and at times humorous.  \\"Air Jordan's\\" features a young child asking for the popular sneakers as a birthday present, \\"Michael\\" a short rhyme about a friendship with a wheelchair bound boy, and \\"Grandma's Kitchen\\" were selections that I particularly enjoyed.<br /><br />While the rhymes and other content of the book were pleasant, the illustrations, which appeared to be an accumulation of grayscale clipart, were lacking.  Parents may consider allowing their children to color the pictures themselves to make the book more personal.  With improved illustrations this book would be as enjoyable to look at as it is to read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Let Your Spirit Soar	THE REAL DEAL: A SPIRITUAL GUIDE FOR BLACK TEEN GIRLS by Billie Montgomery Cook is a book that advises teen girls how to overcome any and every obstacle that comes their way. In a society where how you look determines who you are, it is essential for impressionable black teen girls to know that their appearance should not validate who they are. Important topics covered consist of: body image, self-respect, sex and friendship which allows girls to see how a young Christian woman should handle these situations. Girls learn how to indulge in self-love, self-respect and self-worth. Each chapter is told in a way that's easy for teens to understand and at the end of each chapter is a prayer, a section which asks questions that require the reader to do a little soul-searching and a section for the reader to write their own prayer.<br /><br />An essential part to every household with a teen girl, THE REAL DEAL enables teens to dig deep inside their spiritual selves to find answers to life's most common problems. What I enjoyed most about this book is that although it was written with teen girls in mind, it can also be used by adult women who suffer esteem issues or who aren't sure how to overcome various hurdles that come their way. Reading this book enabled me to do a little soul-searching and because of it I am stronger in my faith.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinnin<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
The Life of a Bird	MY STORY BY FRANCIS THE BIRD is a cute and educational story about a baby bird who falls out of a tree and into the life of woman who takes care of him.  The story is told from Francis' perspective and highlights the day-to-day experiences that he and his caretaker share, including his attempts to learn how to fly.<br /><br />The language is fresh, easy to understand and engaging.  Carla Cain's photography adds an additional dimension to this book and the photographs perfectly compliment the unfolding story.  Children are sure to be fascinated by Francis' story and the intricately detailed photos.  And while they are enrapt in this pleasant story they will be learning a lot of educational information about the early life of birds.  Carla Cain plans to author future books featuring other animals and I am sure this collection will ultimately achieve her goal of bringing nature alive for children.  Hopefully, as a result of this and future works, she will encourage children to put down the video game controllers, turn off the television and explore the great outdoors.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Everything Old Is New Again	We all know and love them, those little rhymes and verses we learned as children.  Nina Crews brings new life to these timeless treasures in her book THE NEIGHBORHOOD MOTHER GOOSE.  In the book, which includes over 40 rhymes and verses, she pairs such verses as \\"This little pig went to market,\\" \\"Rain, rain, go away,\\" and \\"There was an old woman who lived in a shoe\\" with her stunning photographic creations.  The photographs feature children from a variety of cultural backgrounds, and as a result any child that reads the book is sure to find someone on the pages that look like them.  I also liked the fact that the photos included both mothers AND fathers interacting with children in a positive way.  This is a book that I highly recommend, because it can serve as a way that parents can share a part of their childhood with their children.  Many of the collections of nursery rhymes that I have encountered include dated photographs that are not particularly exciting for today's children.  The eye-popping and intricate photography is worthy of endless discussion in its own right.  This book is definitely a must have for any young child's library.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Classics Can Be Fun	Joyce Carol Thomas proves that classics can be fun in her adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston stories in WHAT'S THE HURRY, FOX?  AND OTHER ANIMAL STORIES.  The book contains a sampling of tales included in Hurston's Every Tongue Got To Confess.  In addition to the title story, some of the collection includes \\"Why Buzzard Has No Home,\\" \\"Why the Waves Have Whitecaps,\\"  and \\"Why Donkey Has Long Ears.\\"<br /><br />Collier's illustrations lend themselves to the folksy theme throughout the book.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that each stories illustrations have their own unique look and style.  The stories in the collection are diverse, some will make you laugh out loud and others will make you say \\"hmmmm.\\"  WHAT'S THE HURRY, FOX? is a terrific, child-friendly introduction to a very important American literary figure.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
As Bad As It Gets	Lies. Deceit. Betrayal. Family Secrets. Incest. You know the old saying \\"You think you got it bad, but there's bound to be someone worst off than you\\". That's exactly the situation found within the pages of IN HER PRESENCE by Nancy Weaver. We meet a family that's bound together by control, manipulation and abuse. You think you have it bad?

What Olga did to him while growing up, you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. Rufus believes that Maebelle is Olga's estranged daughter and is set on paying back his vendetta on Olga with Maebelle and her children.<br /><br />Maebelle realizes her dreams are nowhere near coming true the day Rufus holds a gun to her head and calls her Olga Berry. She tries to convince him she has no idea who Olga Berry is, let alone related to her.

Love has many faces	POEMS WRITTEN FOR THE WOMEN I LOVE(D)is not a poetic expose<br /><br />by someone who wants to be a playa, it is poetry with sustenance,<br /><br />expressed by a man who loves women in a pure but not puerile way.<br /><br />Lewis is a student of women, forever learning of their endless<br /><br />mysteries. He has developed a fondness for and an appreciation of<br /><br />females and he mentally documents all he learns for future<br /><br />reference. His poems align him as one of those rare men who<br /><br />respects the sacredness of womanhood.<br /><br />You might ask who these women are? They are everyone: family and<br /><br />friends, who have battled emotional and physical abuse, terminal<br /><br />illness, and vanished husbands, but who have remained strong<br /><br />enough to leave an indelible imprint on this author.  Each poem<br /><br />is a tribute, almost a testimony to how his life has been<br /><br />impacted by women.<br /><br />Poetry is a growing genre in the literary arena and each poet has<br /><br />their own distinctive flow.

Together for life	Twins, Alejandro and Roberto Sanchez live through some volatile and exciting times in THE RETURN OF SF.  Nuns are raising the two of them in an orphanage in Cuba when they are forced to defend themselves against the neighborhood bullies.  When one of the bullies die as a result of the altercation, Sister Catherine has no choice but to smuggle the boys out of Cuba and into the United States to their paternal grandmother in Miami.  In Miami, despite Mama' Sanchez's attempts to keep the truth from them, the twins learn of their father's past, his horrible demise and then get an in-depth introduction to life on the streets.<br /><br />In Bolivia, Sergio Fernandez is finishing up his five-year sentence in prison.  Having survived an attack on his life while in prison, Sergio begins planning for his comeback and taking the helm of his company, The Fernandez Cartel.  After his release, Sergio finds out that a lot has changed, including the leadership in The Fernandez Cartel.

But something goes wrong with a routine take down of a crack house in Miami and most of his team as well as a close friend ends up dead.  Then it turns personal.<br /><br />The twins, Sergio and Agent Lloyd are set for a major collision.  Their paths will cross in the most unfortunate of ways.  Who will be the victor?<br /><br />In his first novel, Dejohn has put together some explosive, hard-hitting action that keeps readers on the edge of their seats.  He lays the foundation for each plot as if he were laying bricks to the foundation of his home-with each layer taking it higher and higher until the climatic ending.  Dejohn packs in plenty of street action, love, sex, guns, drugs, revenge and a cast of characters to be reckoned with.  My only problem with this book was that there were some minor editorial flaws, but they in no means distracted from the story.

Did they walk the walk?	Toby Mac and Michael Tait have penned a history of the United States from the beginning to recent times. These writers attempt to show that the Constitution was meant to portray America as a Christian nation built on Christian principles. From the coming of the Europeans to these shores and the subsequent destruction of the native population plus the decimation of Africans for greed, these authors are able to find the spirit of joy, love and peace in these early settlers. Squanto, a Native American, had been kidnapped and sent to England. When he returned to America, he discovered that the intruders had destroyed his entire village, yet he was able to find forgiveness in his heart and joyfully help the people who settled on land that was formerly his. Phyllis Wheatley, a slave girl owned by good Christian people, became educated and wrote praise poetry for her new country in spite of that country's complicity in ripping her from her family and friends in Africa.<br /><br />Not mentioned is the fanaticism of the Massachusetts Bay Colony that was engaging in religious persecution and conducting witch trials that influenced the founding fathers desire that there be no state authorized religion. Nor is there any in-depth discussion about how the good Christians who owned such a treasure as Ms. Wheatley weren't compelled by their faith to free her long before she became an adult. Or why Squanto had to endure what he did from such God fearing folks. While it is nice to think that all these people were good Christians, the true meaning of Christianity must be taken into consideration.<br /><br />It was written in a non-chronological manner that made it easy to read. Footnotes or some other method of letting us know where the information was obtained would have done wonders to authenticate the work. I do wonder what the benefits of a non-revisionist version of history would be like with a vow to do better in the future?<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewershe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Revenge can be fun	Has someone ever taken advantage of you?  Has someone used you without so much as a backward glance?  Are you tired of this treatment?  Robert D. Adams presents a satirical look at extracting revenge on those who spitefully misuse you in HOW TO GET REVENGE AND LOVE IT.  Although the book carries a warning that it is for adult entertainment only, the humorous look at getting revenge hits pretty close to home in many instances.  The reader is presented with twenty-two chapters, some of which are comically named such as chapter ten, \\"How To Drive A Selfish Woman Crazy, And Make her Love Your Last Year's Dirty Drawers.\\"  Each chapter covers a different scenario in which revenge should be sought and the step-by-step instructions on how to go about doing it.<br /><br />Although very funny and entertaining, Adams's message is clear: do not let people use you.  There is no reason for you to accept it.  Get yours and feel good doing it. His revenge schemes were often things we think about doing, but may fail to put into action. One such plot was his advice in \\"How To Break It Off When The Love Smells Stinky,\\" which calls for failing to attend to domestic issues in order to get the object of the revenge to leave.  I actually found myself laughing out loud at some of the schemes, while a few others took me down memory lane.  As entertaining as I found the book, it could have benefited from some additional editing and I found that some of the language could be construed as offensive.  Despite that, for an enlightening and humorous ride, pick up a copy of this book, but pay careful attention to the warning on the front cover.  (3.5 Rating)<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

When is it too much?	Elijah Brown has had a lot of trouble in his life. He was living in upstate New York where he was charged with assault and sent to prison for two years. Free at last, he decides to move back to New York City. A helpful friend gets him a job as a financial aid counselor at Marquis University. This position permits him to accomplish his dream of getting his bachelor's degree and also allows his real personality to come through. He is known on campus as the man to see when financial aid becomes a problem or a necessity. He is kind and empathetic and the students love him. One student in particular, Chan-Hei Ahn, a Korean student known to his friends as Chi, latches on to him. While on some level, Elijah, a middle aged black man, knows this young student is using him for what he can get, on another level he enjoys the attention and friendship. Soon he is hopelessly in love with Chi even though he is aware that Chi is heterosexual.<br /><br />Ron Johnson builds a fantastic love story that takes the reader along step by step so it becomes understandable when an obsessive attachment develops. Even as you find yourself wanting to tell Elijah Brown to pull back, run away, you can still relate to how he got where he is and why he can't escape. The emotions are so real and vividly depicted I found myself shouting at Elijah to stop being stupid and see Chi for what he is - a mixed up user.<br /><br />The story is about two men, but it is so universal it could just as easily be about a man and woman. I dare say most of us have either been in a similar situation or have had a close friend like Elijah Brown. The story was very real and shed some light on how uneven love can and does occur. I would recommend this story to anyone who wants to know more about obsessive love.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10

Some Secrets Should be Told	At it's very essence DEAR CORINNE, TELL SOMEBODY! LOVE, ANNIE is a story about true friendship told through a series of notes.  The book begins with Annie, a very intuitive young girl, writing a note to her friend Corinne.  Annie notices that Corinne is not acting like herself and has become very withdrawn.  She inquires about her friend with heartfelt concern.  The bigger message in the book is about child abuse, an often avoided topic among people of all ages.  After watching a special about child abuse with her mother, Annie begins to wonder if perhaps that is the reason for Corinne's sudden change in behavior.  Although Corinne doesn't initially reply to Annie's notes or even speak to her in school, Annie continues to write and encourage her friend to get help from a responsible adult.  Eventually, Annie seeks guidance from a school nurse who also sends notes to Corinne asking her to share her secret pain.<br /><br />Some parents may feel that this book is not necessary in their child's library, but I sincerely hope that they reconsider this stance.  Child abuse is more widespread than people think and happens to people from all sorts of backgrounds.  Perpetrators may be strangers, friends, or as in Corinne's case, a beloved family member.  This book provides tools that can help children disclose their own victimization if it occurs or provide support, information and encouragement to friends or acquaintances that may also be victims.  The story is engaging and presents a topic that is difficult to discuss in an open and non-threatening way.  I encourage all parents to pick up a copy of this very important book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Good Home Training	This is a story about three women and long time friends, Colored G.R.I.T.S. (African-American Girls Raised in the South), Beatrice, Anna, and Susie.  Years after divorcing her emotionally unstable ex-husband, Beatrice is still fighting him for her independence.  She is in the process of closing a major business deal that will allow her to franchise her very successful day spa, but entrenched in a legal battle with her ex who wants a piece of the pie even though he has done nothing to deserve it. Anna and Susie are anxiously awaiting the news of the impending deal and preparing to celebrate their dear friend's success.  As the story progresses each of the three women reflect over their lives, revisiting moments from their childhood, college life, and young adult life.  Through these reflections it soon becomes clear that they have encountered and overcome a great deal of pain, sometimes in spite of and other times because of their good southern upbringing and through the support of their good friends.<br /><br />The pains, joys, successes, and failures the three women experience and share are what really carry this book.  Though Beatrice is the main character, I found myself much more intrigued by some of the secondary cast, particularly Anna.  COLORED GRITS lacks positive male characters, and the men that are highlighted are unfaithful and particularly unappealing.  I found this to be a weakness and would have preferred at least one positive African American male character to balance the strong women that were profiled.  The focus on the impending business deal lacked the tension to give the ending a powerful punch and at times this element of the plot made the story drag.  The biggest strength of the book is the superb development of Beatrice and Anna's characters; I understood how their pasts shaped the women they became and felt as if I knew them personally.  I was inspired by their strength and felt they taught the lesson that no matter how old you are or how many bumps you've had in your path; it is never too late to reinvent yourself and realize your potential.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersw many bumps you've had in your path; it is never too late to reinvent yourself and realize your potential. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
The call of destiny	In a distant galaxy where travel is accomplished by moving through openings in the atmosphere, the world is in chaos.  Planets are at war with each other and sorcery is used to keep the balance of power out of kilter.  Glowing spheres prophesize the coming of a savior that will restore the balance of power and release the human souls that have been held prisioners in crystal orbs.  Sounds unrealistic?  Well, in THE SOUL CAGES, readers will find all these things and much more.  The planets, Earth 3012 and Saturn Four, are at war.  In the middle of these two warring factions is Valek, a denizen with a large holding on the Planet Solis.  He has found a way to produce a substance called Solance, which can help one read minds and he is selling it to the highest bidder.  It is a hot commodity for both, Earth 3012 and Saturn Four.  They each believe that possession of this potion gives them the upper hand in war, but little do they know Valek is playing them both for big profits.<br /><br />Valek uses slaves to produce the potion.  Those that give him trouble have their souls drained from their bodies and placed in the soul cages.  All the captured souls talk about a savior and the Minister Knights of Souls that will rescue them and give Valek his comeuppance for all his evil deeds.  But sisters, Sara and Amana decide to escape rather than wait.  Their plans are foiled with Amana being recaptured and Sarah whisked away to the planet Veloris by a mysterious knight.  While on Veloris, she learns of her destiny in the order of the world.

She immediately falls for him and would do anything he asks. Molasses reveals to Janeia that he makes his living as a paid killer, a hit man for hire. While this may scare away the average person, Janeia readily accepts Molasses' occupation. After all, he is living a lavish lifestyle; driving a Bentley, wearing nice clothes and money is no object when it comes to his women. Janeia is being treated to the finer things in life and is happily in love.<br /><br />Although Molasses is good at what he does, he is also a womanizer and has left behind several women scorned. Every woman he meets he manipulates including his new love, Janeia. There is an unexpected attempt on Moe's life, and while in the hospital he reevaluates his current lifestyle and any enemies he may have. While thinking about his enemies he fails to recognize the scorned women from his past. Could one of Moe's past loves have put a hit out on him? Is the attempt on his life a hit gone bad? Will this event cause Moe to turn his life around?<br /><br />Love is a funny thing. When in love you do things you wouldn't even dream of doing outside of love. Dangerous lifestyles bring about dangerous consequences and repercussions, both Janeia and Molasses reap the consequences of living a dangerous life.

That kind of loyalty isn't found every day and if you have it or find it, hold on to it and never let it go. <br />  <br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

New Friends Learning Together	MICKY, TICKY, BOO! SAYS HELLO introduces young readers to three new educational characters.  Micky (a cat), Ticky (a clock) and Boo (an explanation mark) and lead children through a scavenger hunt of sorts.  Each character shares a little about themselves, for example, Micky loves baseball. The readers get involved in the story when the characters ask them to identify certain objects in the accompanying illustration.  An example of this is when Ticky, who is from Mexico, asks readers to locate the Mexican flag in an illustration.  The book continues with its interactive theme by inviting children to answer questions relating to the various facts the characters present, like when Boo asks if the reader knows how to use \\"special marks\\" such as a period or a comma.<br /><br />The interactive nature of this book is its greatest selling point.  The book is sort of a cross between a workbook and a storybook, so it is both entertaining and educational.  The weakness in this book is that it is too scattered; covering flags, telling time, punctuation and exercise all in a few short pages, and there is no cohesive theme that carries throughout.  Because so many topics were covered, it was impossible to really focus on any of the subjects in any great depth.  I could see Micky, Ticky, and Boo as characters in a series of books that introduce children to various topics, with each book carrying a particular theme. I believe children would like the characters and enjoy exploring new things with old friends.  Overall, MICKY, TICKY, BOO!, SAYS HELLO is a pleasant book, but it doesn't quite live up to its potential.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-10
Watch Out for the Grandmothers	Meet Bea Baker Bell, Hattie Collier and Connie Palmer; they are sixty-something grandmothers who, by default, form GRANDMOTHERS, INCORPORATED.  Excited about attending their class reunion, Bea and Hattie pull out all of the stops to make a lasting impression while Connie tags along for the fun.  What they find after so many years are the same cliques and bourgeoisie people from days gone by.  Bea meets up with her high school sweetheart Frank, who is now married to her nemesis, Charlie Mae, aka Charmaine, and the backbiting continues.  Following the reunion Bea and Frank continue to see each other platonically until the unthinkable happens.  Bea, Hattie and Connie form a tag team to investigate an assumed murder and the laughs begin.<br /><br />L. Barnett Evans and C. V. Rhodes have formed their own tag team to deliver a hilarious story of three feisty God fearing women and the families that love them.  Rooted in the Word, each woman interprets its meaning in a different way and live their lives accordingly.<br /><br />One issue stood out that distracted from the flow and that is the misplacement of character names, however the story was fast paced, the storyline developed and I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations of sixty-something year old sleuths.  If you need a light-hearted and funny read, pick up GRANDMOTHERS, INCORPORATED.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Samba, My Love?	Set simultaneously in Orlando, Florida and the bustling city and countryside of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, MORE THAN YOU KNOW by Eboni Snoe is filled with intrigue as the main characters, Mara Scott and Jairo Camara, try to come together in the name of love.  Samba dancing is the catalyst that brings these two together but the harboring of family dysfunction is what keeps them apart.<br /><br />Let down by love, Mara, a design consultant, is talked into taking samba lessons in an attempt to bring some spice into her life.  On a visit to Orlando, Brazilian entrepreneur Jairo literally bumps into Mara and sets a plan in motion to see her again.  When it comes down to Mara's design for a building that Jairo is constructing, they not only have cultural but also moral differences. Both are stubborn with their wants, which provokes a storm of misunderstandings.  Although sad and heartfelt, the story is also humorous because of the antics and one-liners by Mara and Jairo's friends, Sharon and Roberto.<br /><br />Eboni Snoe has penned great characterizations and beautiful imagery in MORE THAN YOU KNOW.  We receive a lesson in the rich and poor culture of Brazil that is interesting and enlightening.  All of the elements of a very good romance novel are here-the romantic setting, the misunderstandings, humor, sadness and finally, true love.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Just one night...	J. T. Evans, a self-proclaimed confirmed bachelor, has watched as several of his friends and family members succumb to the love bug, with a little help from matchmaker extraordinaire Louise Gates, or Mamma Lou as she is affectionately known.<br /><br />When J. T.'s mother casually mentions that she has recently talked to Mamma Lou, J. T. is instantly suspicious.  Vowing not to be the latest victim of Mamma Lou's matchmaking scheme, J. T. puts a plan of his own into action that he hopes will deflect the attention away from him.  Little does J. T. know, when he chooses principal ballerina Juliet Bridges as his decoy, he is playing right into his mother and Momma Lou's plan.  Unbeknownst to anyone, Juliet and J.T. have a past; they met during a blackout in New and shared a brief yet passionate night together.  Will J. T. and Juliet be able to pull off this elaborate deception without giving in to the intense desire that has been smoldering between them since they first met?<br /><br />Celeste Norfleet has penned yet another heartwarming tale of the power of true love.  Not only did I find myself laughing out loud at J. T. as he attempted to outsmart a crafty old lady, I also found myself remembering that initial blush of love between my husband and I, causing me to fall even deeper in love with him.  I am a Norfleet fan for life, and can't wait to find out who's next in Mamma Lou's matchmaking radar.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
As long as I get mine	Growing up in one of the worst projects in New Orleans, lawyer Nina Jones's childhood was not a bed of roses. The street life was her life, and she did whatever she needed to survive, including selling her body to the highest bidder. Nina wanted more out of life and knew her book smarts would be her ticket out of the ghetto.<br /><br />Once Nina finishes law school, she returns to the streets of New Orleans, but in a different way. Now she has a daughter to raise and wants only the best for her child. Before she passes the bar, she makes her living by giving lectures to those in the drug community on how to avoid conviction. After she passes the bar, she seeks out rapists, drug dealers, pimps and other criminals to represent. As long as she gets paid upfront, she doesn't care about their guilt.<br /><br />She doesn't care until one of her clients is murdered, and now the people who set up his murder want to silence her. The only problem is, she knows next to nothing. Her client had lied to her about the motive behind the murder he'd committed. It's a race for her life. If she has a chance at surviving, she must take the bits of truth she has and make the connections: murder, money, cocaine, politics, conspiracy.<br /><br />THE CONNECTION is a fast paced, exciting read. Smith started the novel out with Nina as a teen. She showed how Nina became a woman that would have no qualms about defending people she knew were guilty as long as she got paid. Nina was not a likeable character. When the tides turned against her, I felt that it served her right, yet I still didn't want for her to be harmed because Smith had done a great job of showing you her background. In a way, I felt sorry for her.<br /><br />There was one large hole in her character development. She didn't mind defending criminals, even one who she knew had raped an eight year old child, yet when she defended a murderer, she felt kind of guilty. That didn't add up, especially since she had a daughter close to the age of the child that had been raped. Otherwise, her character makeup was consistent and this book is still a great read.  I look forward to more works by S.W. Smith.<br /><br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerslose to the age of the child that had been raped.

Retribution	Even-paced and representative of not only society, but also individual goals, actions, and motivations, THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT is my favorite Walter Mosley book to date.  I would go so far as to say it's brilliant.  Touching on the areas of love, power, jealousy, guilt, and retribution we witness a multitude of thought-provoking observations that will lead to heated and multi-angled conversations amongst readers.  It further justifies the notion that for every action, there is a reaction and/or consequence.<br /><br />Charles Blakey is basically an underachiever accustomed to getting by doing as little as possible.  When he's fired  from his job at the bank for embezzlement, he becomes concerned with keeping his house in Sag Harbor that has been in his family for generations.  Unable to get a job around the small town and somewhat content in sitting around doing nothing, he receives an unexpected visitor who can possibly assist him in his troubles.<br /><br />Anniston Bennet is white, wealthy, and normally gets what he wants from people.  When he requests to live in Blakey's basement for the summer at a whopping offer of $50,000, Blakey doesn't quite know what to expect.  He immediately tells him no, but after the man leaves, promising to return later, Blakey reluctantly comes to the conclusion that he'll be able to pay his mortgage with the money.  This begins a journey as he later accepts the proposition and spends the most bizarre summer of his life, learning not only about the man he's rented his basement out to (and who's living in a cage), but also learning more about the world.<br /><br />While it isn't clear what time period Mosley is writing about, it's crystal clear that the purpose of this book is to transcend time, to make the reader think and question life, reflecting back on ones own experiences in life, good and bad. Bennet represents the world, its problems and the things that concern us, while Blakey probably represents an individual's role in society.  I'm not quite sure, but I do know that at the end of the book, you find yourself asking...was Charles really in charge and exactly what impact does guilt have in our lives?

Friends or Foes?	Debut author T.N. Baker introduces three best friends and all of their drama in the novel SHEISTY.  Epiphany Wright grew up in a two-parent home, and what she lacked in love and parental guidance was made up for in material things.  At a tender age, she learned the art of gold digging and has used that along with her father's drug money as a way to make a living.  She constantly uses guys for what they can provide for her, until she hooks up with a gangster named C-God who threatens to destroy everything Epiphany has- her friendships, her sanity, and even her life.<br /><br />Everyone thinks that Keisha Moore has the perfect life.  With a fine, wealthy fianc&eacute;, a nice home, an excellent education, and a baby on the way, things could not appear to be better. Yet Keisha is scared and lonely. Ultimately, her loneliness will drive her to do the unthinkable, and her life will never be the same.<br /><br />Shana Scott is the wild child of the bunch.  She is into drinking, drugs, and having a good time.  Shana has always secretly been envious of all that Epiphany has, and that jealousy leads her to commit serious actions with dire consequences that affect all of the friends.<br /><br />SHEISTY was a quick read and as the title suggests full of drama.  Although the characters are colorful, the author could have spent a little more time developing them.  In addition, there were many typographical and grammatical errors that were a huge distraction.  Nonetheless, the action kept the book moving and keeps me anxious to see the fate of the friends in the sequel Still Sheisty.	2004-10-09
A Spiritual Goal	A wonderful and delightful meal of spiritual awareness still does not adequately described Faith Adiele's journal titled, MEETING FAITH.<br /><br />What started out as a journey to travel abroad through the Rotary Club International Exchange Program lead to an exposure to the Buddhist religion and then to the decision to becoming a Buddhist nun. Faith Adiele's narrative is witty and compelling to read as she invites the reader to her coronation through the forest to Buddhism.<br /><br />She describes in details her Thailand travel beginnings, her exposure to another country's way of life, her mixed emotions, and a decision to partake a spiritual baptism in becoming a Buddhist nun. Faith is forthcoming and leaves nothing to the imagination. Footnotes listed beside the text give definitions of Thai terminology and explanations for various Buddhist terms used in the book.  Faith includes sections of her journal along side the text as well.<br /><br />Faith's journey was intense because it strips away who you are and takes you to another spiritual level and philosophy of understanding yourself and your environment. The readers are awarded the opportunity to take a significant peek into the rituals and practices of Buddhism.<br /><br />Knowing two African American friends as well as several celebrities that practice the Buddhist religion, this book gave me more insight and details about their beliefs. I enjoyed reading this book because it was definitely unique and interesting.<br /><br />Faith Adiele shares with the readers an informative and revealing segment of her \\"forest journals of a Black Buddhist nun\\" in MEETING FAITH. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to know more about the practices of Buddhism and the commitment of one woman's travel towards achieving her spiritual goals, which are never-ending.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Evil lurks near us everyday	Evil is always lurking, always on the lookout for an opportunity to rear its ugly head and always ready to mount a surprise attack, catching us unaware of impending doom.  But it is a Holy, God-fearing person that is always prepared to do battle with the forces of evil no matter the circumstances.  In ALL THINGS HIDDEN, Officer Jael Reynolds is no slouch to performing her duties as a homicide detective for the Dadesville County Police Department.  She is touted as the cream of the crop when it comes to homicide cases in the police department and she is well respected by other members of the force and her team. She also has a secret weapon in her daily walk with crime, her faith in God.  So when known drug dealers in the area turn up murdered, with no clues left behind and nobody willing to talk, Jael relies heavily on God for direction and guidance especially when the tide of the crime spree turns and knocks on her door. Will she be prepared for the ultimate test?<br /><br />Jael is a divorced mother of one son, Ramon.  Her ex-husband, Virgil, is a constant thorn in her side when it comes to rearing their only child.  Due to her past relationship with Virgil and her current relationship with God, Jael has used work as an excuse to avoid dating.  However, it appears that God has other plans for her in this aspect too as He puts FBI Special Agent Eric Grant, an exact replica of The Rock, at her disposal during this crisis. Their relationship begins tentatively and proceeds to one of mutual respect and high romantic interest.  Will Agent Grant help solve the crime or give Jael dreams of another nature?<br /><br />Judy Candis has written a great detective crime story with many elements to make this a smash hit.  The heroine is a smart, likeable African American with heart and soul and a deep abiding faith in God. The hero is a man straight from her dreams and has enough courage to lean on God also as well as encourage her to strengthen her faith.  There were so many twist and turns in this book that it was very hard to put down.

Meeting your match	In FLIPSIDE OF THE GAME, meet Vera Wright-Turner.  Her mother is a crackhead who left her in a plastic bag in a trash dump.  Her grandmother taught her all the in's and out's of using drugs while she herself fell prey to the demons of drug use.  Her grandmother's boyfriend rapes her.  She is put into foster care until Aunt Cookie and Uncle Boy rescue her.  To say that Vera knew how to play the game before the age of ten is an understatement.  For years she grew up believing her mother did not love her.  She grew up believing you take care of self first and forget the rest.<br /><br />Now Vera and her all-girl gold diggin' crew are all grown up and playing the game like pros should. It's play or be played.  They take no prisoners.  It's every man or woman for him or herself.  The only thing off limits is each other's man, past or present.  That is until love enters the picture.  In Vera's case, her mantra is \\"don't hate the playah, hate the game.\\"  But her script gets completely flipped on her when she meets her match in Taj Bennett, a doctor born and bred in the hood also, who knows the game just as well as she does.  He's looking for the one and has tagged Vera.  She is so caught up in her hatred of her mother and her self-absorbed behavior that she isn't trying to fall for any of it.  She may find herself on the losing end of more than a bankroll.<br /><br />Tu-Shonda L. Whitaker told a story about the drug-infested hood in vivid imagery without all the blood and gore.  This book was written from the depths of her soul and it showed on every page.  The drug scene tends to be glorified in ways that only add to entrapping our culture within its ugly grip, but Whitaker focuses on the issues that result from drug addiction; the side of this industry that has claimed many lives.  We see the babies born addicted to crack, the mothers who spend their food and rent money on crack, grandmothers who get caught up in the thrill of crack, and then the family members who are left to hold the family together.  I cried and laughed right along with the characters in this book.  Whitaker really drives her points home in her main character, Vera, as I was able to see how her life's everyday struggle could be traced back to her birth from a crack-addicted mother and the very environment she lived in.

Her fianc&eacute; abandoned her for his ex-wife. And her job abandoned her by laying her off. In the words of a famous sailor, \\"She's had all shes can stand, and she can't stands no moe.\\" Thirty-eight years old, Jada has closed her heart and refuses to be a victim of abandonment again. The perfect job opportunity has opened up for her in paradise-St. Thomas-and she intends on starting her life anew, man free.<br /><br />Randall Larimore can't believe the love of his life, Jada Gracen, has walked into his office for a job interview twenty years after he broke her heart.

Combining patience, friendship and love, he intends on healing her broken heart and earning her trust again.<br /><br />TROPICAL HEAT is hot!

Once they were reunited, the transition from Jada refusing Randall's romantic advances to her pursuing their relationship could have used more development. Otherwise, TROPICAL HEAT kept me going.

Remember me?	It has been years since Arnelle and Winston have spent any significant time together.  But to Arnelle's dismay, Winston doesn't remember her.  At first, she believes it is a game because of what went down between them, but she soon realizes that he really doesn't remember her or anything that happened.<br /><br />Because of their friendship with Venice and Craig, characters from the author's previous works, Arnelle and Winston are often in each other's company, although they can't stand each other at first.  But, as time progresses, the animosity turns into attraction, and the couple begins to enjoy spending time together.  Although the relationship is going strong, Arnelle's secrets haunt her daily.  Will she tell all before Winston's memory comes back of that fateful night?  How will he react once he finds out what really happened and the other secret she has been harboring for years?<br /><br />While I did enjoy this novel, it read pretty much the same as Lee's previous works.  She has proven her writing abilities; I would love to see her spread her wings and tackle something other than relationship drama.

Each death is chalked up to a drug overdose, and no one refutes that claim until Violet, the mother of Dr. Kendra Hamilton, turns up dead from an overdose.<br /><br />Kendra refuses to believe her mother overdosed; instead she believes it was murder.  Her belief is so strong, it prompts her to call in a few favors to get the local police department to give her mother's death more than the cursory glance it would have normally received.  During the course of the investigation, other secrets are revealed which changes the dynamics of everything.

She was abandoned early in life by her teenage mother and later grew up being humiliated by others.  She also suffers horrendous abuse at the hands of her grandfather, the same man who savagely beat and killed her grandmother.  In an attempt to escape the harsh realities of her life, Ruthie develops some very bad habits, and makes several bad choices, one of which includes getting married at a very young age (for the wrong reasons), which ultimately ends in divorce.<br /><br />Even though her past is horrific, she does not allow the ugliness that was her life determine her future.  When she meets the man that will eventually become her second husband, Ruthie's life begins to change for the better.  With the love and support of her second husband and his family, Ruthie begins to flourish.  She goes on to become a wife, mother and career person, titles she never thought she would hold.<br /><br />GAL: A TRUE LIFE was an absolutely riveting book.  The emotions were so real I could feel them, as if I had actually lived Gal's life.  I commend the author for having the fortitude and the desire to share her painful childhood with the world.  I do understand the author's desire for anonymity, but I would love to meet and hug the woman behind the psuedonym Ruthie Bolton.

Got a night light?	Brandon Massey has pulled together a chilling collection of stories by an impressive group of authors in the anthology DARK DREAMS.  While there were quite a few stories I enjoyed, some were particularly noteworthy.  \\"Hair Story\\" by Joy Copeland had me thinking twice about what I did with the leftover hairs in my brushes and reminded me of an old wives tale I heard frequently in my childhood.  \\"Resident Evil\\" by Zane highlighted her flexibility as an author and was just the right balance between erotica and horror.  \\"If Walls Could Talk\\" by L.A. Banks really took the \\"woman scorned\\" saying to a whole new dimension. Authors known for their work in this genre such as Tananarive Due, Steven Barnes, Robert Fleming and Brandon Massey also showcased their skills.  Finally, I have become a new fan of some of the writers I was not previously familiar with and look forward to reading more of their works in the future.<br /><br />The good thing about this anthology is that there is something in it for everyone.  While readers may not enjoy every story in this collection, they are sure to find one (or two or three) they will enjoy.  I appreciate the diversity in the authors selected; well-known and lesser known writers are included in addition to authors that are traditionally pigeonholed into other genres.  Readers looking for a change of pace with regard to reading will find this collection a refreshing one, that is, as long as they are willing to sleep with a night light.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09

Oscar seems content with the life they lead, but Shirley knows there is more to life, and she's going for it. So what if she forces her daughters to become \\"escorts\\" as they reach their teens? Without the money they bring in, Shirley would never be able to get them out of the projects.<br /><br />ZONING OUT, ZONING IN has a memoir feel to it as Linda, the main character, flashes back to memories from her childhood. Lisa McConnell draws vivid pictures of the Taylor family's struggles, celebrations, abuses and triumphs. Because of Ms. McConnell's flashback style, character and plot development suffer. She does an excellent job of getting you to care about the characters, but with that caring came questions of what happened and why.<br /><br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
To Protect and Serve	LOCK & KEY is the memoir of retired policeman Richard L. Allen.  The book tells of Allen's poverty stricken years first in Gary, Indiana, and later in Newark, New Jersey, and how all of the crime he saw surrounding him strengthened his resolve to become a police officer.  As a young adult, Allen joined the military where he served over twenty years before he ultimately became an officer of the law until his retirement in 2001.<br /><br />The book recaps some of Richard Allen's most memorable experiences both in life and in uniform.  The incidents are full of detail, but unless you are familiar with the streets of New Jersey they may seem a bit overwhelming.  The events are not always in any kind of order which makes the book choppy and unorganized.  In addition to being a memoir, LOCK & KEY also contained original poetry and song lyrics.  I enjoyed these items, but I think they may have been more effective if they were grouped together in a separate section.<br /><br />In spite of the book's shortcomings, LOCK & KEY gives a wonderful portrayal of what it is like to be a policeman and made me think about and appreciate the men and women who often risk their lives to protect and serve us.	2004-10-09
Computer Love	Heartbroken and disillusioned with dating, journalist/writer Paige Reece is encouraged by her best friend to answer an on-line personal dating ad. Though skeptical at first, Paige decides to forge ahead and give the on-line dating scene a try. After a little searching, Paige comes across the perfect ad, and decides to respond to the sender. To Paige's pleasure, the author of the ad is a successful political analyst, looking for a special someone to share in celebrating the completion of his doctoral thesis. Enticed by Paige's wit and charm, which resonates throughout her e-mails, Dr. Rodrick Garret decides to take the plunge and invite Paige to the perfect secluded, weekend getaway. What ensues are four glorious days of romantic e-mails, and long \\"getting to know you\\" phone calls, all in anticipation of that fateful first meeting.<br /><br />In WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? Charlotte Turnquist has created two likable, intelligent characters in Paige Reece and Dr. Rodrick Garret. Unfortunately, Turnquist does not do enough with the plot of the novella to showcase these fine characters. The author builds the reader up in anticipation of the character's face-to-face meeting, but leaves that entire encounter out of the storyline. On one page, we read that Paige is ready to leave to meet Rodrick, we experience her lingering doubts about the unknown and we relish in her enthusiasm about perhaps meeting and falling in love with Mr. Right. The very next page, we  read e-mails of the two discussing what a wonderful time they had, with no details as to what went on during that much anticipated weekend. What? The reader is left confused and unsatisfied, and wondering what transpired between the two. Did they like one another as we thought they would? Why, after all the hype, it appears that they will never see one another again? Or will they? What could have been a lovely journey into the romance of two likable characters was stalled and then hindered by a storyline that went nowhere.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Inside of Me	It isn't often that you read a memoir in which the author throws everything on the table in an attempt to use their mistakes as stepping-stones for someone else; so that they won't make the same mistakes in their lives.  Shellie R. Warren does just that in her recently released title INSIDE OF ME: Lessons of Lust, Love, and Redemption.  It is a remarkable story of her younger days and how she was able to turn her life around and focus on knowing that intimate relationships are a gift to be cherished and not just shared with anyone.<br /><br />Through her experiences of being involved with men intimately, seeking \\"love\\" and the approval of men, women everywhere can see the flaws in the logic as well as the deprivation to one's mind, body, and soul.  She boldly shares her story in a way that not only touches you, but grips you into the depths of the pain she endured.  She shares not only the reasons not to have sex until marriage, but also the issues and problems resulting from some intimate relationships.<br /><br />It is through this book that young women can learn to fully appreciate their virginity and older women in the dark can step into the light, heal themselves, and move away from the hurt of the past.  It is also a book to be shared with young boys and men as well because they too can benefit from Warren's insight, her faith, and her conviction.  The body is a vessel and should be treated as such.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
What's done in the dark...	Can a leopard change his spots?  Is there any truth to the street adage \\"once a playa, always a playa?\\" Rhonda Lawson, author of CHEATIN' IN THE NEXT ROOM, has created a character that will make you believe there is truth in that saying.<br /><br />During his college years, Christopher Lee was the player to end all players, bedding every woman who caught his eye.  When he meets Andrea, he's immediately attracted to her, and views her as one of his many conquests.  Chris' intentions are to \\"hit it and quit it\\", but when he notices that someone close to him wants Andrea also, he marries her to keep her for himself.<br /><br />Even though the basis of the marriage was not conventional, Andrea and Chris are happy and in love, and everything is going well.  That is until Chris meets Alexis, the cousin of Andrea's best friend. In the blink of an eye, the dog in Chris is back full force and he and Alexis are hitting the sheets hot and heavy.  Will Chris be able to keep his adulterous liaison under wraps and preserve his marriage?<br /><br />CHEATIN' IN THE NEXT ROOM was a quick, but predictable read.  With a subject matter of infidelity, I expected lots of drama, but it was decidedly lacking in that aspect.  I did, however, like the fact that Andrea was not a weak, whiny woman and one who didn't feel as if her self-worth was based on having a man.  With a little more work developing stronger plots, I believe Lawson will become a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Spoken word artists must peep this...	NAPPY EDGES by Ntozake Shange is a collection of poetry written during the<br /><br />Seventies on a myriad of issues in the poet's trademark style.  Shange creates<br /><br />a rhythm that leaps from the page and lyrically dances around the room.  The<br /><br />words beg to be spoken aloud, and the emotions implore you to feel them.<br /><br />Shange's message is often pro-woman as she deftly builds phrases that<br /><br />sometimes seem unrelated to form a heavy lesson.  Also included in this<br /><br />collection is a speech that she gave to a conference in which she discussed the<br /><br />poet's right to individual expression.  She challenges readers to know their<br /><br />poets and to know what their individual sound or flow is like.<br /><br />It's hard for me to pick one favorite poem from this compilation.  Each poem<br /><br />speaks to a different place and a different time.  Nonetheless, this is a<br /><br />volume of poetry that needs to be on the shelves of all verse lovers and on<br /><br />the lips of all those who strive to express themselves lyrically.<br /><br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
The Black Mafia	Ike Capone's debut offering, THE HUSTLER'S DON, delves into the life of Franklin \\"Wyte Yak\\" Whitehead, a young gangster who rules the streets with an iron fist. Wyte Yak and his friends always dreamed of being top dogs in the rap and drug game.  Those dreams seem to fade when Wyte and his brother Pooh Berry are caught with drugs and sentenced to prison time.  The sentence actually turns out to be a blessing in disguise, as Wyte is able to make connections that will allow him to take his street game to a whole new level.<br /><br />Wyte Yak is released from prison and within weeks he has set up an organization that sells the best cocaine in the world.  He brings in all of his friends and the clique calls themselves the Career Criminals.  Wyte Yak has control of his men, but his weakness comes in the form of a woman, Coretta.  Will Wyte be able to have his woman and his crew or will it all crumble?<br /><br />THE HUSTER'S DON tells the tale of a man and his insatiable desire to rule the streets no matter what the cost, yet Ike Capone gives Wyte a conscience and shows him to be human.  The novel shows how an empire is built and that in order to succeed it takes a team effort and trust.  It also shows what happens when trust is broken and shows the consequences of being involved in street life.<br /><br />THE HUSTER'S DON is a very engrossing story, but there are so many characters that it is often confusing trying to keep up with the various members of the Career Criminals.  The grammatical and typographical errors  were also an unwelcome distraction from the story.  Yet, Ike Capone has written an exciting street tale that is sure to please fans who enjoy books of the urban fiction genre.	2004-10-09

A Poet's Life	In his candidly written memoir EYES FREE, celebrated spoken word artist Taalam Acey paints an extremely intimate self portrait and allows the reader a raw, unabashed view of his life story.  With his straightforward and unencumbered prose, Acey does a remarkable job of affording the reader access to his innermost thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />EYES FREE is a story of triumph and the ability to change life's challenges into opportunities and then making the most of those opportunities.  The author affirms this time and again as he takes the reader through his life's journey, frankly detailing his beginnings as \\"a child of some of the most god-awful blight the modern world has ever known.\\"<br /><br />Whether divulging the vivid details of his promiscuous lifestyle before, during, and after his failed marriage, relating the gritty details of his stint as a rapper and then drug dealer, or simply relating his experiences garnered during his travels as a spoken word artist, Acey manages to maintain a smooth, clear writing style that very effectively holds the reader's attention.<br /><br />Rich with fascinating anecdotes and thought provoking observations, EYES FREE is a thoroughly engaging read and a true testament to the remarkable storytelling ability of Taalam Acey. This author writes with a fluidity of expression that leaves the readers hard pressed to put this book down.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
My Take	Linsey Savage takes us on a spiritual journey of his life in AN UNCONVENTIONAL VIEW. Beginning with his childhood in Philadelphia and into adulthood, Savage lays out the trials and tribulations that have shaped him to be the man that he is today.  Born into a strict Pentecostal family, he was the second youngest child of seven children.  His childhood was one of school and church, nothing more.  His friends were church associates; the world he knew was his immediate family and church family.  Over the course of time different issues and the behavior of the pastor and parishioners slowly became warped and Linsey watched as his brothers and sisters and the younger generation of the church rebelled and subsequently left the church and its teachings.  What church teachings could propel a young man to flee his home church and the city of Philadelphia for Chicago?<br /><br />AN UNCONVENTIONAL VIEW is laid out chronologically beginning with an introduction explaining the author's reasoning, desire and need to write about his life.  The introduction alone is profound and heartfelt and begs you to keep reading. The chapters that follow take us through each phase of his life and the offerings are peppered with his spiritual connection with God.  Regardless of his circumstance, Savage had faith and that faith sustained him.  The author's writing is mature and quickly grabs your attention.  One thought continuously came to mind as I read about his childhood - out of the mouths of babes.  Some of the chapters that follow are a bit repetitive as he seeks love in all the wrong places only to find infatuation, lust, selfishness and deceit.  Despite Savage's trials, to some he may offer a thoughtful and emotional lesson and to others, an incomprehensible and perplexing message.  AN UNCONVENTIONAL VIEW is a heart wrenching and sad, but spirit-filled account of one boy's life into manhood and his dealing with the hand he was dealt.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Private Battles	John Head lived the \\"American Dream\\": supportive wife, 2.5 children, fantastic job, great home, tennis buddies, family, friends... his list of blessings was long enough to make most envious; yet fulfillment and contentment were just beyond his grasp, sitting on the other side of depression.<br /><br />He was trapped in the cell of depression, and no matter how hard his family and friends tried to break him free of his imprisonment, they failed. This was a battle John's loved ones could not fight for him. This was John's war; all others had to take a supporting role.<br /><br />John Head's life is literally an open book in STANDING IN THE SHADOWS. In order to help African-American men-and those who love them-win the fight against depression, John Head reveals his revelations, struggles, failures, successes, and strategies for dealing with depression.<br /><br />As I read STANDING IN THE SHADOWS, I could see how men suffering from depression could identify with John's struggles and hopefully seek help. As the wife of a diagnosed manic-depressive Black man, I could identify with the stories of John's family struggles. At times, Mr. Head became preachy on issues such as the role that racism plays in depression in African-American men and the stigma many Blacks have against admitting and treating mental illnesses, but otherwise this is an excellent book that is very informative and personable.<br /><br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
People aren't always as they appear	What is black? Can that one word truly sum up the range of our skin tones? Do the blue-eyed soul brother and sister really exist? Ann Girard would passionately tell you, \\"yes they do,\\" because she is living proof.  Although born to black parents, Ann inherited eyes, hair, skin tone, and other features unlike most people of our ethnicity - and she constantly received grief because of that.<br /><br />Struggling to find her place in the grand scheme of things, Ann had to fight her way through school to prove herself. Black kids called her \\"pretender\\" while the white kids called her \\"confused.\\"  She wasn't black enough for some brothers yet still too black for other guys.  Her mother, being an unquestionable shade of brown, couldn't identify with her daughter's struggles, and thereby failed to instill in Ann a sense of pride in who she was. Only throughout her pregnancy while journaling her past is she able to define \\"black\\" for herself and come to terms with the harsh reality of being in the middle.<br /><br />WHAT LOOKS LIKE BLACK by K. Broussard serves as an open window inviting in the breeze of a different perspective on being black.  We see firsthand Ann's thoughts, her experiences, and her pains. We are truly given the opportunity, in case we have never had one, to see just how difficult it can be for lighter complexioned African-Americans to get along in this country.  Using the journal as an excellent way of segmenting into Ann's past, Broussard smoothly transitions between her character's past and the present without missing a beat. Sufficient amounts of drama, coupled with real life situations, like normal pregnancy issues, combine well with good character development to shape a satisfying read.  However, I would like to have seen Ann's past connect more with her present and future. For example, almost none of the characters in her past are still present in her life. I would also like to have read more about her relationship with her husband, Gavin, past and present.  Aside from the above-mentioned comments, and occasionally distracting grammar errors, WHAT LOOKS LIKE BLACK is an enlightening, enjoyable novel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerst and present.

Wanna bet...	Reggie Miles has finally worked up her courage to try out for the Grambling University dance squad. Being a senior, this is her last chance to step out of her shy shell and show everyone what she's got. Her flawless performance at the tryouts catches more than the judges' eyes. Trae Brooks, a star athlete and the man she's been secretly pining for the past three years, has finally noticed her. Intimidated by Trae's reputation as a womanizer, Reggie decides to follow her heart and give Trae a chance.<br /><br />When Trae's crew bet he can't seduce the straight laced Reggie, he laughs at their feeble challenge. Trae knows he can have any woman he wants, and Reggie will be yet another notch on his belt. He quickly finds that unlike his past conquests, Reggie isn't interested in shallow relationships or people. In order to save face and win the bet, he allows Reggie to get to know the true Trae. In the process, he does the unthinkable-he falls in love with Reggie. He can't bare the thought of losing Reggie, but he knows he must tell her the truth about the bet.<br /><br />Veronica tolerated Trae taking other women to bed, but there is no way she will stand by while he gives some prudish, wanna-be dancer his heart. Veronica's chased him too long and hard to allow this frump to come in off the street and take what is rightfully hers. Trae will be Veronica's, and she doesn't care what she has to do to get him.<br /><br />Ann Clay sent me on a gratifying trip down memory lane with her debut novel, MORE THAN A BARGAIN. I knew arrogant jocks that bet on their future conquests. I knew the shy on the outside but passionate on the inside wallflower. And don't get me started on the self-absorbed beauties that felt the world owed them.<br /><br />While Clay's character and plot development were strong, she did have a telegraphing issue-telling what will happen then showing what will happen. She also slipped into redundancy occasionally. All-in-all, this is a great debut novel. The characters resemble people you'd see on just about any college campus. Watching the drama between Reggie, Trae and Veronica unfold made me say \\"awww,\\" laugh and even angry at times.

Compelling	MATTERS OF THE HEART by Juanita Bynum delivers a wonderful, right-on-time message concerning walking into the full light of God's love with a \\"new heart.\\" It speaks to the battle of the mind, which is worldly based, versus the heart, which is soul based. The mind will resist the revolution that the soul is undergoing as the Christian grows in their relationship with Christ. The need for this renewal is paramount because the word of God cannot flourish in a hardened heart. It is imperative that the heart and mind be in line together.<br /><br />Often times, God will allow us to endure a wilderness experience. During this time, it is a retrospective period where we learn more about our faith and ourselves. This desolate time will help us to begin to examine the contents of our heart and our mind. One key teaching in the book that really stood out to me is that the abundance of what is our hearts will pour out of not only out mouths, but in the manner in which we conduct ourselves.<br /><br />MATTERS OF THE HEART is not a book which you can take lightly. The message from the pages pour into your consciousness and minister to your soul. It is very well written, easy to read and chock full of Bible scriptures which fortify the message Ms. Bynum is presenting. This is a necessary read for anyone seeking to encourage a change in their life. MATTERS OF THE HEART presented a very timely message for me by really causing me to examine the manner in which I approach situations and taking pause to examine the contents of my heart and responding in a kinder manner. This book does not touch on anything new - more so, it is the manner in which the information is conveyed that challenges the reader into a new operating plan. Personally, MATTERS OF THE HEART has helped me to give pause to reflect on the things that are pleasing to God versus esteeming those that are pleasing to man. With the abundance of scripture and food for thought provided in the book, God's words have been reaffirmed to me and I felt a sense of renewal after mediating upon the message this book conveys.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersn reaffirmed to me and I felt a sense of renewal after mediating upon the message this book conveys. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Nedine <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2004-10-09
All it takes is a dream...	Television and some books depict how hard life in poorer parts of the city are, the threats which can potentially take over the lives of our youngsters, converting them into criminals or worse yet, leading to their demise.  When three young boys in Newark, New Jersey meet, they each have various backgrounds, interests, and their own share of problems, but one thing they all have in common is loving mothers who push them to strive to make something of their lives.  In this remarkable story of three friends who build a bond and establish a pact with one another, we are introduced to a friendship overflowing with opportunity and friendly competition.<br /><br />Traversing from their times of hanging out with the wrong people, to skipping school, and even run-ins with the law, each boy goes through their own course of growing up.  Even early on, it's noted that they each are smart, and with the right support and motivation, they could do more than most young boys in their neighborhoods.  Encouraged by George to participate in a Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Program for minorities so they could attend college together, the other two friends agree and thus they form the pact to help each other reach their dreams -- together.<br /><br />It is refreshing to see young boys stick together, encourage each other and then attain the goal they've set for themselves.  It should be required reading across school systems, in our communities, and households as it not only teaches that dreams are attainable, but also shows the power of friendship.<br /><br />Because the book is told from the viewpoint of each author, it does get a bit repetitive at times and probably could've been edited a bit more to enable the reader to see other aspects of the doctors lives.  In spite of this, it is a remarkable story worthy of being shared with not only youngsters, but those who aren't quite sure of what direction they want to follow in life.  A sense of pride came over me while reading this book and stayed with me after  finishing as I read about their foundation set up to give back to the community, The Three Doctors Foundation.

Soulful Icon	Luther Vandross, the man, the legend, the songwriter, and the soulful icon, who has touched so many lives throughout his career, is showcased in Craig Seymour's biography titled LUTHER, The Life and Longing of Luther Vandross.<br /><br />The book begins with the tragic event of Luther's assistant finding him collapsed in his home from a stroke. This was a shock to his mother, who had already lost three of her children through illnesses, his friends, and fans.  The outpouring of prayers from his fans, celebrity friends such as Aretha Franklin, Patti Labelle, and Jessie Jackson among other noted singers and actors was overwhelming for a singer who has entertained the world with his voice and songs.<br /><br />Craig Seymour's LUTHER chronicles Luther Vandross' life revealing several unknown facts about the singer including his childhood; his family; his rise in the music industry, his disappointments, and his interaction with artists during the early years of his musical career. Luther's love of music totally surrounded him while growing up. He enjoyed writing songs and composing music, but never considered being out front. He was always the behind-the-scene type person either as a back up singer, a producer, or songwriter. He suffered bouts of loneliness and alienation, that lead him to compulsive eating, which became his comfort zone. This was causing an ongoing battle with his weight gain.<br /><br />Luther didn't fit as comfortably in the musical culture as other entertainers, which included partying, drinking, and drugging. He chose instead to focus more on his music and the goal of making it big one day in the entertainment world. With strong determination, Luther carved out a successful career where everyone soon noted his musical talent. After increasing recognition and successful songwriting for other singers, he finally stepped into the limelight and has been making his mark ever since.<br /><br />Did you know that David Bowie was one of the first people who truly recognized Luther's talent? Luther worked with him for a while behind the scenes and traveled with him while in Europe. Did you know that while in college, Luther passed himself off as Dionne Warwick's brother?  Did you know that Luther wrote and sung commercial jingles?  In the book are other tidbits about musical artists that Luther worked with over the time and the unhappy years he struggled to reach stardom.<br /><br />Mr. Seymour does an excellent job of centralizing Luther's biography around other entertainers, family, and friends that remind readers, everyone is human. If you are a die-hard fan of Luther Vandross, you do not want to miss out on reading his biography. There's an abundance of information about Luther Vandross you will learn and appreciate while reading this book.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading LUTHER because as a fan, you only know Luther Vandross as a performer and songwriter. Now you're given an opportunity to know him as a man, son, and talented individual respected and love by all. I grew up listening to Luther's songs, which always had smooth, soulful sounds and memorizing words that once you learned them; you had to sing along whenever his songs were played.  I know we all are looking forward to seeing the man behind the soulful voice in performance one day soon.<br /><br />A standing ovation to Craig Seymour for sharing the life of a wonderful entertainer for the readers and fans of Luther Vandross.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewersople who truly recognized Luther's talent?

A Classic Redrawn	Through childhood, many fairytales, wives tales, and urban legends grace the ears and massage the minds of people of all cultures.  Stories children treasure live on and mentor their own children for generations.  Even though the basic storyline is not new, it continues to entertain.  New illustrations, new twists in the plot, and additional or more colorful characters all combine to help the classics survive the time change and speak to young, modern minds.  LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, illustrated by John Kurtz, is one such example of an adapted classic.<br /><br />We all know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, however, Kurtz has adapted the illustrations to suit our children in the African-American community.  The main character is beautifully drawn, as well as is the supporting cast.  Aside from the aesthetically pleasing pages and the wonderful, \\"Disney-esque\\" images, Kurtz also adjusts the story ever so slightly to teach children the importance of obedience.  My only complaint with the book is that on a couple pages the pictures, as cool as they are, don't match with the story.  Other than that, this redrawn classic is a good addition to the budding library of our children.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Keeping up...	Solomon Jones is most known for his urban mysteries and commentaries as a columnist for a Philadelphia newspaper, but in his new book KEEPING UP WITH THE JONES, he goes another route.  Jones paints a humorous view on being married, having kids, and all that comes with it, and does it from a man's perspective. It is this viewpoint that makes the collection of stories stand out. Additionally, the use of the cliche' \\"Keeping Up with the Jones\\" was a perfect title.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the stories and collective humor of each piece, my biggest joy with the book was sharing his experiences with his wife and daughter Eve.  As a wife with my own two-year-old, it was very easy to relate to the Eve of Destruction sections and all the things the Jones' experienced with their little one.  Some of my favorite stories in the book were the ones in which his daughter was running things as only our children can do. I also loved the male take on having to pick up feminine products, playing with girl toys, and his interactions with his wife.<br /><br />Jones clearly exhibits love and pride for his family and the stories are witty, cute, and a few of them I found really hilarious.  I'd definitely recommend KEEPING UP WITH THE JONES to anyone interested in how love, marriage, and parenting really is...with the laughs included.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

The Beat Goes On	WALTZES I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN takes readers on a historical tour,<br /><br />which nicely captures the ambiance of early 1900s Jamaica and<br /><br />Europe. It chronicles the tale of John Moneague, a product of the<br /><br />rape of his impoverished Jamaican mother, apparently at the hands of<br /><br />a Caucasian sailor.<br /><br />After his mother's brutal murder, John is raised by an old Chinese<br /><br />woman, who dies, leaving John at the tender age of 10. John then<br /><br />becomes the charge of a young Caucasian-American woman, Miss Shaw,<br /><br />who is drawn to John because he reminds her of her nephew, who had<br /><br />been murdered along with her brother and his wife, a black woman, in<br /><br />an impossibly racist America. When Miss Shaw has to return to<br /><br />America to care for her ailing father, John finds himself in the<br /><br />care of a Jewish couple, the Meitners, who soon thereafter, forge<br /><br />documents and carry him off to Europe.<br /><br />The saga continues as a pubescent John finds himself deeply<br /><br />entrenched in their very elaborate forged identity scheme, to help<br /><br />Jews escape Germany. For a while, life continues on even keel for<br /><br />John, then financial woes set in unexpectedly and John finds that<br /><br />Mrs. Meitner has a dirty secret, which is exposed with calamitous<br /><br />results.<br /><br />Drawing on her knowledge of historical facts of the period, Dyer<br /><br />writes a fascinating story of intrigue, lust and deception. The<br /><br />story spans a vast landscape from John's early years in the poverty<br /><br />stalked, tropical island of Jamaica to a life of privilege in cold,<br /><br />foggy England. The author has an admirable feel for the time and<br /><br />place and pens a story that will stay with the reader long after the<br /><br />last page is turned.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
A History Buff's Treasure	BLACK FIRSTS is a wonderful collection of historical facts reaching through the hands of time.  Ms. Smith provides insight to more than 3,000 individuals and events in BLACK FIRSTS.  She opens our eyes and introduces us to these great pioneers.  The book is broken into various topics such as sports, writers, religion, civil rights and education just to name a few.<br /><br />Using the book as my reference guide, I created a trivia game for Black History Month.  Examples of questions included:  \\"Who was the first Black woman to head a major educational institution for Blacks?\\"  The answer is Fanny Jackson Coppin who was in charge of the Institute for Colored Youth of Philadelphia.  Another question was based on publishing-icon John H. Johnson and Johnson Publishing Company, which currently publishes such great magazines as Ebony  and Jet.  The trivia question was \\"Which well-known Black publisher first published the Negro Digest in 1942?  With such comprehensive information contained within this BLACK FIRSTS, it lent itself well to my attempt to become more familiar with Black history.<br /><br />Admittedly I am not a history buff, yet this book I found to be very comprehensive and interesting.  Ms. Smith consistently cites her references and captures the information beautifully.  For anyone looking to learn a little more about themselves by travelling back into history, then BLACK FIRSTS is a necessary read.<br /><br />This review refers to the first published addition, ISBN 1578591171.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Getting off the merry-go-round	Life is often what you make of it.  If you allow people to control you and dictate how you respond in life, you will become battered and disillusioned.  In SYDNEY, we meet Sydney Bingham who is trapped in an abusive relationship.  Ken Minister has been abusing her for years.  Sydney lives in constant fear of receiving another beating from Ken. When she discovers that he is cheating, she finally wants off the merry-go-round and does what she has to get off. This decision will put her in a precarious predicament, which will help to shape her move from Atlanta to Chicago.<br /><br />In Chicago with a new job, very little money, a will to survive and some emotional baggage, Sydney strikes out to shape her own destiny.  Her first real friend is Todd Henley, a gay cocktail server.  Todd brings with him his ability to be just like a dear sister friend and some much-needed laughter into her dull existence.

Will she be able to hang on to it?  Or, will she lose her man and her best friend?<br /><br />C.S. Kirksey has written a wonderful story about recovering from abuse and finding yourself while neatly packaging it in a love story.  Each unforgettable character added a unique twist to the story. Kirksey vividly weaved each one into the story and invited readers to walk with them as they lived through love, anguish, joy, heartache and hatred.  I loved how she began the story with Sydney staring into a cup of tea as she contemplates her life with Ken as going around in circles. Kirksey later ends with Sydney staring into another cup of tea realizing that with growth and healing, her life was no longer moving in circles.  This was an astonishing story, one that left me wanting it to be drawn out just a little bit longer.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Up Close and Personal	Short stories, connected characters and seemingly outrageous and hilarious behavior is the gist of SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA by Sydney Molare.<br />Twenty short stories highlight a particular neighborhood somewhere in America that could be my neighborhood, your neighborhood, or anyone's neighborhood, anywhere in America.  The stories hit on the usual suspects, cheating spouses, the down-low brother who is not gay, the philandering preacher, the gold-digger, domestic violence, the maintenance man, too many rules from my parents, wacky weed, baby mama drama and the list goes on.  The stories are funny and gritty; the book is fast-paced and will have you shaking your head at the chaos happening.<br /><br />Molare presents a realistic view of a typical neighborhood and its surrounding area that showcases human beings and the situations that they create for themselves.  My favorite short story is the last one titled SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA, which features an elderly resident who has watched all the drama and heard all of the rumors amidst her window.  It is truly hilarious as she proclaims - \\"My neighborhood, your neighborhood.  Ain't no difference.  Don't matter if it's hoity-toity or the ghetto.  Ain't no different!  The more things change the more they stay the same.  You can move, but you can't escape it.  Folks are the same everywhere.

A Global Love Affair	Carina Reynolds is a vibrant young scientist who is on the fast track with a successful career and a loving family.  She falls madly in love with Leon Hightower who whisks her away into a dashing love affair that is unrivaled. Their love is a storybook romance.  Together they are a harmonious unit dancing to life's rhythm; apart they are incomplete and unfulfilled.  A dark cloud rains on their parade, causing Cara to question everything that she has come to know and love. Her Prince Charming belongs to someone else who is cunning, conniving and ruthless, and this woman will stop at nothing to demonstrate that her man is just that - her man.<br /><br />Fast forward four years, Cara is now living in Nairobi and conducting research on endangered species.  After running away from her disenchanted life in the States, she still has not found happiness.  She delves into her career with an unrivaled intensity in an attempt to erase the memories of days gone by. As an employee of ILRES, Cara is well respected for her work ethic and thoroughness.  ILRES has fallen on some financial bedrock that could shake it to its very core. Deciding that it needs to get back on the right track, the firm hires an independent consultant.

Together, will Cara and Leon be able to uncover the scheme that is shuffling much needed research money from ILRES?<br /><br />VOWS OF PASSION is a contemporary romance novel that provides a geographical twist. It is an easy read and will, for the most part, draw its readers through the storyline to find out what is next.  I enjoyed the suspense regarding the unraveling of the crime swirling around the ILRES labs. I felt that at some points the story line digressed a bit too much into the wiles of Cara's heart and the relationship she shares with Leon and their attempts at reconciliation.

The Essential Guide to Natural Hair Care	Natural hairstyles and care is an area that is often overlooked by magazines<br /><br />and style guides, however, in TEXTURED TRESSES, Diane Da Costa sheds light and<br /><br />wisdom on this neglected area.  Da Costa, a stylist to the rich and famous,<br /><br />shares her perspective and experience on the uniqueness and versatility of<br /><br />natural hair.  She dispels the style myths which relegate natural hair wearers<br /><br />to corn rows, afros, and dread locks and replaces that mindset with tools and<br /><br />tricks of the trade that make a natural head of hair synonymous with a blank<br /><br />artist's canvas.<br /><br />Filled with rich black and white photos of musicians, models, and just plain<br /><br />folks as illustrations of the various styles, TEXTURED TRESSES provides more<br /><br />than a technique guide.  Da Costa discusses the emotional, spiritual and<br /><br />lifestyle aspects that may attract people to a natural hairstyle.  She spends<br /><br />a significant amount of time discussing healthy hair and the steps that you<br /><br />can take to achieve it.  She also names various products to use which is<br /><br />helpful for people who don't know where to start the natural hair grooming<br /><br />process.<br /><br />TEXTURED TRESSES uncovers a world of styles that will push anyone over who is<br /><br />sitting on the fence of trying to decide to go natural.  Da Costa gives<br /><br />easy to follow instructions and wonderful examples of a plethora of<br /><br />hairstyles.  As a wearer of a natural style, Da Costa provided some answers I<br /><br />sought on hair coloring and I was thrilled when I found the Salon Directory<br /><br />that she included in the back of the book that lists a number of salons around<br /><br />the country that specialize in natural hair care.

Is This Really Happening?	African Americans, and African American women in particular, are contracting HIV at an alarming rate. I believe that AND YET THE BIRDS STILL SING is a novel meant to open eyes to this tragedy.<br /><br />Diane is a happily married woman with two young children.  As a social worker, she is privy to victims of life and bad circumstances on a daily basis. She is a warrior for the people, for human life. But one fateful day would change Diane's life forever.  She learns she is HIV positive.<br /><br />Shocked, stunned, and wrestling with the implications of living with HIV, Diane begins to feel her life spinning out of control.  She isn't sure who to trust; her husband seems the most likely candidate for having infected her. Diane learns that she must look inside herself to find her own path to healing.<br /><br />Jayson Young had a great story and concept with AND YET THE BIRDS STILL SING, but the way the book was edited and laid out was extremely distracting. There were no chapter divisions and, at times, it felt like I was reading the world's longest sentence.  The editing was virtually non-existent, as typos and misuse of words and grammar abounded. Along with these surface flaws, there was a lack of depth and a rushed nature to the book. It was as if it was being pushed forcefully into its ending instead of gently coaxed.  I think Young has a very good concept on his hands that, with proper polishing and scrutiny, could become a wonderful book.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09

What`s Done In the Dark...............	Portia Davidson first surfaced in Moody Holiday's book Wild Innocence: Tales from the Eighties as a snobby, poor little rich girl that all the girls loved to hate and the boys drooled after.  In that story I agreed with the assessment of Portia and was not interested in her story.  After reading a synopsis of SECRETS: Portia's Story, my curiosity was piqued and Holiday definitely has a story to tell not only about Portia but Portia's entire family and how they came to be.<br /><br />Portia is wild and reckless, but her father, the infamous Dr. William Davidson, pillar of the community, constantly bails her out of trouble all in the name of appearances.  Born to an alcoholic mother and controlling father, Portia does not have a clue as to who her father really is, in terms of his behavior, and as a reader we hear the tale of the Davidson family.  While this is Portia's story it is also the story of William and his secrets and the secrets of their ancestors.<br /><br />As Holiday takes us back to Portia's maternal and paternal great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers, the issues of passing, black mistresses, land, money and mental illness, we realize there is definitely drama at play; drama that is passed down from generation to generation. The entire scenario of the courtship of Portia's parents was enough of a shocker.  I thought this was an excellent touch because it made me knowledgeable about William and Portia's behavior, which is dysfunctional to say the least.  While reading I gasped at some of the happenings and thought people do not behave like this.  However, remembering the family history and its affects on William and Portia, it all made sense.  There is a lot going on in this tale and there are many characters seemingly connected.  I made some family trees to refer back to as I read, just to keep all the players together.  There are some recurring characters from the other three books, which only add to the completeness of this story.  How Portia survived all of her antics and those of her father, I will never know but I get a sense that because a neighborhood family took Portia in to provide some sense of normalcy, sense of family and strong shoulders, Portia was able to survive physically but not emotionally.<br /><br />I believe this is Holiday's best book to date because she has weaved an unbelievable tale of family dysfunction coupled with mental illness, lust, greed, incest, and charity.  Although former characters return from her previous books, I do not believe it is necessary to read them in order to grasp SECRETS: Portia's Story.  Some of their roles are minor but it was refreshing to catch up with them. Be forewarned, there is no neatly packaged ending because a sequel follows titled No Ordinary Love and I look forward to reading how Portia's story plays out, if it does in fact play out.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

On the Prowl at Princeton	Murder and mayhem seems to follow Veronica \\"Nikki\\" Chase wherever she goes. When we first met her, this Harvard economics professor solved a murder on her home campus. Then, she investigated a death on Yale's grounds. In ORANGE CRUSHED, Thomas-Graham's third book in the Ivy League mystery series, Nikki is on the case when her friend and mentor dies at Princeton.<br /><br />Rumors have been flooding both Harvard and Princeton that Earl Stokes, a noted African-American studies and economics scholar, was on his way to becoming a Harvard department head and leaving his Princeton roots behind. Nonetheless, Earl is the force behind a new African-American Studies building at Princeton that would bring the program abundant success. But Nikki smells a rat in her mentor's midst, and her hunch is confirmed when Earl turns up dead.  Nikki sifts through the suspects one by one, searching for motive and opportunity.<br /><br />Thomas-Graham is fast becoming one of my favorite mystery writers. She injects humor into her stories and into her characters, making Nikki Chase and her crew people who I would love to hang out with. She writes extremely well, with fluidity, grace, and poise. Using Ivy League colleges as a fresh backdrop and an amateur investigator as a sleuth, Thomas-Graham keeps me on the edge of my seat until the end. I'm officially hooked on this series, and I am anxious to see which campus Nikki will leave her mark on next.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
A Compilation of Living History	WE WERE THERE is a collection of photographs, brief biographies, and first hand accounts from African American men and women who have served in the armed forces during times of war.  These first hand accounts include stories from veterans that served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, The Persian Gulf War and the ongoing War on Terror.  The author includes veterans from many different parts of the United States and includes most branches of the military.  It would be a disservice to select a few of the people included in this collection, as each individual made an important contribution to our national history and security and each of their stories touched me in a different way.<br /><br />WE WERE THERE is a book that should be a part of every library, particularly those in African American homes.  While the book is targeted to adults, the language and format of the book lends itself to be easily used with children and even in classroom settings.  These veterans, ordinary people like you and me, have had extraordinary experiences defending the United States and the ideal it represents in spite of the obstacles such as racism, sexism and dangerous warfare, that they encountered.  I particularly enjoyed the fact, that the book uses the words of the men and women who are relating the experiences, allowing the individuals to have their own voice.  And the voices shared in this collection will educate as well as inspire.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Growing Up Is Hard To Do	The setting for A FORWARD MOTION by S.L. Givhan is the 1970's where we meet Crystal Alexander and her cousin Danielle. Growing up in the lower income section of town,  they made the most of what they had. They were surrounded by drugs and crime but had fun in spite of it all. Just like the young generation now loves B2K and my generation grew up loving New Edition, Crystal and Danielle and their friends were in love with The Jackson 5. They would have done any and everything to meet their favorite celebrities face to face. The majority of their teen years were spent listening to, and following the careers and personal lives of The Jackson 5. In addition to being in love with The Jackson 5,  both Crystal and Danielle were involved in serious relationships during their teen years. Crystal was involved in an interracial relationship with Julian Parker. Color was no barrier for Crystal and the love of her life. Although their relationship wasn't received well by others, they continued pressing on to ensure that their love would stand the test of time. Julian's family ends up relocating to California and Crystal doesn't know what to do when her heart is broken. Is there a chance for them to reunite in the future? Danielle, on the other hand,  is involved with Resnick, who is in a band. They marry at an early age and Danielle realizes the glitz and glamour is not all it's cracked up to be. Seeing a side of her husband she has never seen before, she wonders  who is this person she married and what happened to the man she fell in love with, and did she even know him at all? We follow Crystal and Danielle from their teen years to their young adult years, through all the trials and tribulations we are there. We watch as they materialize from young immature girls to strong women and through it all the bond they share is not broken.<br /><br />A FORWARD MOTION is a coming of age novel that follows the lives of Crystal and Danielle Alexander. Although a good story line, the characters aren't well developed and several of the friends had nicknames and the author would flip back between the real name and nickname,  and at times,  it was a bit confusing knowing who was talking and to whom. The book would have received a higher rating if there weren't so many misspelled words and grammatical errors. I found myself looking for errors instead of following the storyline.

The text is original and is a very detailed account of the struggles and sacrifices many black people had to make during the early 1900's.<br /><br />The storyline centers on Jack Seabody and his coming of age in South Carolina, surrounded by segregation and lynching amidst his family who owns acres of land. Because blacks could not own land during that time, they had to resort to getting a trusted white man or family to own it on paper.<br /><br />After experiencing his first ride in an airplane, Jack develops a strong desire for flying and is offered an opportunity to work as an assistant and learn to fly by a white pilot from Chicago. Unfortunately, he is forced to make the decision and trip quickly after helping his sister fight off a white neighbor attacking them.  Later, this man is found dead and Jack is accused of his murder. He is swished away from his home and sent to Chicago to meet up with the pilot.<br /><br />After his arrival in Chicago, Jack works hard and eventually becomes a successful stunt pilot. Being light in color, Jack passes for white. In doing so, he is afforded the opportunity to go places people of color cannot. Jack is able to stay in rooming houses and travel the city without notice until his race is revealed by a cunning mistress of the pilot.<br /><br />When Jack meets up with his uncle in Chicago, he is forced to confront several family issues and secrets along with some serious decision making. He is introduced to Saffron, a black journalist, and they soon develop a romantic relationship. Saffron is an activist who is out to write about the positive accomplishments of the black race, and wants to include Jack in her writings. Jack, on the other hand, wants to avoid any detection of his race so that he can continue to make money and travel anywhere. Saffron forces Jack to make a decision on their relationship and his racial identity. Will Jack continue with the charade or will he allow his love for Saffron to help make the right decision?<br /><br />Ms. Woods does an excellent job intertwining the historic backdrop of the Jim Crow era and the decisions many black people were forced to make in order to stay alive. THE COLOR OF CLOUDS brings forth intense emotion, yet a wonderful fictional storyline that was unfortunately a way of life.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />Of The RAWSISTA Reviewershis racial identity.

Social Drama	We all have our guilty pleasures, for some it may be sex, others it may be food, or it may be something as innocent as a warm bath with a good book.  In her debut novel, aptly titled GUILTY PLEASURES, author Sonya Harris shows just how much drama can be generated by pleasurable things.<br /><br />Simone Miller is fed up.  She is tired of her corporate job, the drama with her so-called friends, supporting family members, and her on-again, off-again relationship with boyfriend Andy.  On the advice of a good friend, she consults  Dr. Rosen, a psychiatrist, and begins to take control of her life and all the drama that ensued.<br /><br />GUILTY PLEASURES takes the reader on Simone's journey as she tries to improve her life and well being by diminishing all of the unnecessary baggage she carries.  She soon finds that it is not as easy as it may seem to let go of things that are good to you, but not good for you.<br /><br />Sonya Harris has crafted a novel that encourages one to look within oneself and take inventory of some things that may be causing them to have social drama.  The book also has tidbits of scriptures and sayings to help inspire.  While I thoroughly  enjoyed the book, I found the sequencing a bit confusing and often had to read several passages over to see at what point they happened.  Nonetheless, GULTY PLEASURES is an enjoyable read that truly lives up to its title.	2004-10-09
Teenage Love	Sharon Flake's latest literary endeavor, WHO AM I WITHOUT HIM?, is a collection of ten short stories that explore different variations of teenage love and angst. These stories present an accurate portrayal of teens and their experiences.  The tales range from humorous to serious and each teaches a lesson on love and life.<br /><br />One of the stories that I enjoyed was \\"Wanted: A Thug\\" which dealt with one girl's desire to have a bad boy, who happens to be dating her best friend, without thinking of the consequences.  Another story, \\"A Letter to My Daughter\\" has a guilt ridden absentee father writing a letter to his fifteen-year-old daughter to try and educate her about boys and give her a view of relationships from a male perspective.<br /><br />Sharon Flake has again penned a novel that both entertains and educates teens by presenting them with characters that are just like them.  These stories reflect the lifestyles and situations that all teens are familiar with and can relate to, but at the same time present positive messages. What I enjoyed and respected most is that the author keeps the stories authentic by not making them all preachy or having a sappy, happy ending. I highly recommend WHO AM I WITHOUT HIM? as a must read for all teens, but especially for the younger teenagers who are on the cusp of dating.	2004-10-09
Coffee anyone?	Brandi Owens has finally fulfilled her life-long dream of owning her own bookstore.  Over the Rainbow is situated in a quaint little shopping mall<br /><br />located in a residential community.  Brandi is so in awe of the success of her business that she spends all of her time working and leaves no time for a relationship. Breathtakingly handsome Sam Carlson comes to the bookstore every morning to not only purchase his daily paper, but to talk to Brandi.  Although Brandi's employees constantly tease her about the crush that Sam has on her, she is unaware of this fact because her only concern is running the bookstore.<br /><br />Sam is the owner of Where Worlds Meet, a coffee shop located right next door to Brandi's bookstore.  Sam, afraid to make his feelings known, looks forward to seeing Brandi every evening when she comes into his shop for a cup of hot chocolate.  When Brandi is audited by the Internal Revenue Service for shady business practices, Sam comes to her rescue.  In the midst of Brandi's turmoil Sam reveals his true feelings.  Will Sam and Brandi find the courage they need to take them over the rainbow where worlds meet?<br /><br />Courtni Wright has written an enchanted story of two people who are destined to find everlasting love.  I was instantly drawn into the story and did not want to see it end.  I am not a coffee drinker but after reading this tantalizing tale, I was tempted to get a cup.  ESPRESSO FOR TWO is a novel that readers will enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
A Biblical Mystery To Solve	Damietta wants to be a detective like her father when she grows up. Therefore, she is always on the lookout for a mystery to solve. One hot summer, she finally gets her chance to play detective. Mysterious incidents begin to occur once priceless biblical artifacts are put on display at the local museum. First, Dr. Weatherspoon,a neighbor and an archaeologist,is visited by two strange men.  As a result, he ends up in the hospital. Just when Damietta,with the assistance of her cousins Tiffany and A.J, try to piece together the identity of the strange men and the significance of their visit, the museum is burglarized and several artifacts are taken. Armed with an inquisitive nature and the help of family and friends, Damietta sets out to try and solve the two mysteries. In order to solve the mysteries she must first discover how the ancient people of the Bible relate to people today and then discover how the stolen artifacts are connected to one another. The answers to the mysteries will solve a crime, question the authenticity of the Bible, and test the faith of all involved.<br /><br />In TWISTED, Tim Everett set out to entertain and educate young adults about the stories of the Bible. He also tried to teach about the Bible's connection to Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology. The novel started off as a promising read of Christian teachings coupled with an exciting mystery. However,the reader is let down mid-way through the story, the mystery was too quickly and easily solved. The last few chapters of the novel involved a sermon that is literally preached to both the characters and reader as a way to conclude the mystery. The novel, as a result, looses its charm and becomes too bogged down in rhetoric, causing the last portion of the book to become a laborious and stagnant read. The novel would have been great if the author had taken the time and allowed the characters and reader to learn the lessons it set out to teach as the answers to the mysteries were being uncovered. TWISTED had likable, funny, and intelligent characters who unfortunately were placed in a story with a rushed plot.<br /><br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerscovered.

Full Bloom	At the center of DEAD ROOTS, WILTING FLOWER by Anthony D. Carr is a young girl who lost her mother in an automobile accident at a young age and loses her father as a young woman.  When O'ne Gold accepts her inheritance from her father's attorney, she also accepts a manuscript written by a close friend of her father's.  DEAD ROOTS, WILTING FLOWER is the story of Kayla Wright and Albert Gold and their traumatic, emotional and mental connection as friends; it is a script of Al's adult life, pre and post Kayla and the circumstances surrounding On'e's fortune or misfortune.<br /><br />The story takes you back and forth between the past and the present as you read about Kayla's relationships with her former lover and her mother.  Al's story is one of his break up with O'ne's mother and the ensuing custody battle between Al and the child's grandparents. Additionally, we are treated to reading about the life of Kayla's grandfather in the mines of Alabama and its unclear relevancy to Kayla's life.<br /><br />The story transitions between the past and present and is loaded with issues of loyalty, friendship, mental illness, infidelity, homosexuality, HIV and fathers' rights.  Carr is vivid with his descriptions of the characters' emotions, however I was left with a false sense of closure as it pertains to Kayla's illness.  DEAD ROOTS, WILTING FLOWER is an exceptional story, with an intriguing opening and told in a very emotional and painful manner.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Real answers	Over the last few years there has been an influx of financial self-help books<br /><br />on the market.  Most of the books are speaking to people's woes over rising<br /><br />prices and a shaky economic environment.  101 REAL MONEY QUESTIONS joins a<br /><br />growing army of these sorts of books, but author Jesse Brown brings freshness<br /><br />to this arena and approaches a difficult topic in an easy and understandable<br /><br />manner.<br /><br />In 101 REAL MONEY QUESTIONS, Brown sets up a dialogue between himself and<br /><br />countless people with financial concerns and answers some basic and not so<br /><br />basic questions on creating a sound financial foundation.  His focus is<br /><br />primarily on planning for the future via answering questions about retirement,<br /><br />IRAs, estate planning as well as a plethora of other related topics.  His<br /><br />directives are written plainly without the overwhelming jargon that usually<br /><br />accompanies discussions on portfolios and the like.<br /><br />While the book was written in plain kind English minus the usual jargon, I<br /><br />found myself a becoming a little frustrated over the absence of certain<br /><br />information.  The book is written from a point of view where the seeker of the<br /><br />data already has knowledge of financial strategies as well as a financial base<br /><br />to start from.  I was looking for really practical common sense information on<br /><br />how to get started.  He talks about establishing a cash reserve, but how do<br /><br />you truly do that when you are living from paycheck to paycheck?  How do you<br /><br />pay for insurance when you are living in an economy where rent and basic<br /><br />living expenses are eating up the limited cash flow that you have?<br /><br />101 REAL MONEY QUESTIONS answers many questions on building wealth once you<br /><br />are on relatively stable ground.  I think this book would be really helpful to<br /><br />folks who have started to plan for their future in some way.

Nothing But The Dog In Me	Why would a happily married, God-fearing, father who appears to have it all: a well paying job, nice home, and two cars, cheat?

Enlighten	SOULGASM by Alice Parris is a collection of poetry that speaks to your inner and outer soul. The book cover is beautiful and will instantly catch your attention.<br /><br />Each poem reflects on something significant about life and emotions. Alice's poetic style is nice, yet incomplete to me because the intensity of some of her selections leaves you hanging. But make no mistake, she speaks in volumes on the soul,love, and emotions.<br /><br />Several selections stood out to my delight such as \\"Many Waters,\\" speaking on the rivers of pain in our soul; \\"The Phoenix,\\" focusing on rising up again  and \\"Two Sides of your Love,\\" depicting the sweet and sour of love. They were very uplifting selections which I truly enjoyed.<br /><br />Overall, Alice Parris' collection of poems in SOULGASM provides an enjoyable read while curled up in a comfortable chair with a cup of tea. The selections will provide a poetic appreciation with soaring satisfaction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Wonderful example of street fiction!	Chicago's meanest streets are infested with gang activity, drug trafficking, and dishonest cops who think they're above the law.  The two primary gangs are The Apostles, led by Solemn Shawn, and The Governors, led by a former Apostle, Vaton \\"Vee\\" Dawon.  Infusing present day action with flashbacks from Solemn Shawn's life growing up, we are able to see how he became to be called Solemn Shawn, the hardships of his life, and how someone so young could be so serious about life.  Quiet-spoken, yet fearless, Solemn Shawn was not only respected during his young years locked up after a run-in with his step-father, but also when he started his gang and later when he was released.<br /><br />On a quest for power, each gang has their own rules of the street, but pretty much stay off each other's turf.  The problems arise when a Governor is given the \\"cold war\\" -- a process by which he's beat up for some infraction against the group and then all his personal effects are confiscated...all by members of the same gang.  He's a bit beyond bitter and in essence loses his mind.  He goes to The Apostles trying to join their camp, but is turned away.  Hell-bent on getting back at all of them, he kills a Governor and leaves items behind to incriminate The Apostles.<br /><br />An all-out war ensues and as you can imagine, lives are lost, loyalties are questioned, and everyone is left wondering who will come out on the top.  Not that it's not bad enough what's happening, but it's really bad timing for Solemn Shawn as he's decided to move out of the area with his pregnant girlfriend and settle down into the right way of living.  He's in love with her, looking forward to being a father, and wants to protect her from the world in which he's become enmeshed.<br /><br />This is my first time reading this author's work, but I was highly impressed with THE APOSTLES and Blak's ability to take street fiction and my perception of the genre, and show me a better quality than what I've read before.  Though dealing with the street life, I didn't feel as if he glorified it, nor were any of the scenes over-the-top or just thrown in for shock factor.  They were real.  Well-written, fast-paced, and non-stop action.  He did an excellent job with characterizing each individual, especially Solemn Shawn.  I wanted to step inside the pages and get to know the characters better, to help them in their various dilemmas.  And, while I didn't want the ending to happen the way it did, I applaud Y. Blak Moore for keeping it real.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersad before.

Reclaiming true love	Often life is like the roll of the dice, you never know where you may land, but you must make the best of whatever situation you find yourself.  In SEEKING SALAMANCA MITCHELL, Benjamin Baker appears to have it all, the woman he loves, a job, and a promising future as a singer/songwriter.  But somewhere along the way it got messed up and in a blink of an eye he could possibly lose it all.  Cinnamon, his piano, was the only love of Benjamin's life until he went to work for Alfonse Mitchell in Sally Helen's Restaurant.  While working in Sally's, Benjamin meets and falls in love with Salamanca Mitchell, Alfonse's daughter.<br /><br />Driven by the need for more money, Benjamin inquires about working more hours at Salley's.  This request leads him into the seamy underside of Alfonse's business.  Just beyond the walls of the restaurant is a business of thievery and Alfonse is the leader.  His power is unmatched by anyone.  In fact, when the heat is turned on, a couple of key players are killed and Benjamin is left holding the bag so to speak.  He has been set up to take the blame and do the sentence for Alfonse's burglary ring.  Salamanca, on the other, hand, finds herself alone, pregnant and facing a very angry father, one whom she has to run from to protect herself and her unborn child.  With the course set, Benjamin has to survive the next seven years in prison and Salamanca has to survive the next seven years on the run from her father.  Will they hang on to their love?  Will there be any more casualties?<br /><br />Just when my temperature had been waning on urban literature, I got smacked in the face with this gritty tale from the streets of Washington, D.C.  Kenji Jasper created a gripping story about the love of music, the love of a significant other, betrayal and crime.  The characters in this book took on a more humanistic appeal than those in some of the other books of this genre.  They were presented with flaws just like any regular person instead of the typical shoot first don't ask any questions persona.  Jasper's writing style is such that I felt I was a fly on wall as Benjamin raced to reclaim his life with Salamanca and their child.  Those that love the urban experience will view this as a magnificent find, just as I did.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Fighting Against All Odds	Typically, I am not a fan of non-fiction, let alone historical documentaries. Yet BROTHERS IN ARMS is definitely a book that convincingly swayed my opinion. Highlighting the trials and tribulations of the 761st Tank Battalion, which was a unit of colored soldiers never meant to face battle, this book does an excellent job documenting their joys, sorrows and memories. The book revolves around Leonard Smith, a family friend of Abdul-Jabbar and an original member of the 761st.<br /><br />Although the racial cloud of inequity followed the unit throughout their military careers, they were involved in successfully defending many areas of the European theatre. Originally assembled only to gain the continued support of the Black community during the tenuous times of WWII, the 761st was called into action due to the severe causalities suffered by the Allies. The Battalion successfully defended the European theatre during many crucial battles. This included the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 under the direction of General Patton.<br /><br />BROTHERS IN ARMS is a captivating literary work that paints a vivid picture of how life was for the Black soldiers. It is not overloaded on details or military jargon that would prevent the average reader from comprehending its historical accounts. If I could offer one suggestion, it would be to have maps included which depict the<br /><br />areas of battle. For anyone interested in learning more about WWII and the challenges experienced by its Black soldiers in the throes of racial injustice, then I'd definitely recommend BROTHERS IN ARMS.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
A Great Resource!	Are you mired in debt and looking for a way out?  Does your financial situation look bleak?  If so, fret no more.  Pick up a copy of DEBT-FREE & PROSPEROUS LIVING: BASIC COURSE by John Cummuta and let your financial wellness commence!  This is an awesome resource in helping you devise a plan to become totally debt free.  Free from steep credit card balances.  Free from the monthly constraints of a mortgage.  Free from any type of debt that is currently bogging you down.<br /><br />In DEBT-FREE & PROSPEROUS LIVING: BASIC COURSE, Mr. Cummuta lays out a financial formula, which if applied consistently to your personal situation, will help you to achieve a better financial situation.  Using his formula, the reader is able to actually achieve a date as to when they will be debt-free.  How exciting it is to discover this revelation!<br /><br />I was first introduced to this plan at a local college where I enrolled in a financial workshop.  This initial investment was one well worth the costs of a three credit course!  The financial blessings that I have received as a result are priceless!  Using Mr. Cummuta's plan, I was able to improve my credit score by over 50 points in a year's time!  The information is easy to apply and to be honest, is probably something we've all heard before, yet the application of the information is truly valuable.<br /><br />Our local book club has selected this plan to continue to apply to our unique situations.  We have an upcoming presentation based on this workbook, yet some of the members have already begun applying this information to their personal situations.  The testimonies of our members are also very compelling.  One particular member said she could realize financial freedom from her student loans, credit cards and car note within a two-year period.  Another stated she could be debt-free from these same constraints in a 4-year period.  For a small investment, which is just the cost of this book, you could also have a similar testimony!<br /><br />In my opinion, this would be a self-investment well worth the costs.  In addition to the workbook, cassettes and software are available.  Although our local group did not choose these options, we did develop our own spreadsheets to track our progress.  If I had the opportunity, I would thank Mr. Cummuta for putting this information together.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerslar testimony!   <br /> <br />In my opinion, this would be a self-investment well worth the costs.

The game of love...	What is it that causes some people to take drastic measures to maintain a facade of affluence when they are actually so broke they can't afford to pay attention? This is the case with Darien Jackson, public relations expert.  At one point in her life, she could afford the finer things, but when she loses her job due to corporate downsizing, her financial outlook is decidedly bleak.<br /><br />This doesn't deter Darien, though.  She maxes out her credit cards, skips a few bills, and plays a game of cat and mouse with her bill collectors, all just to keep up appearances.  Things go from bad to worse when the repo man comes looking for her car.  With the help of a couple of crafty individuals, she manages to avoid immediate repossession.  But when the repo man finally catches up to her, Darien puts on a show worthy of an Oscar.  Her act is so convincing that Maxwell Ferguson, the repo man, decides to let her work off her past due car notes as a PR consultant for a family owned business.  Little does Darien know, Maxwell is not the repo man, but instead the CEO of Allied States, LLC., his family owned business.<br /><br />Although his family thinks Maxwell has taken leave of his senses by falling for Darien's story, Maxwell stands firm in his decision to hire Darien.  The fact that she is beautiful only cements his decision, although he fights the attraction at first.  What will happen when Darien finds out who Maxwell really is?  Will Darien's lie backfire?  Will their relationship weather the storm?<br /><br />Every time I pick up a novel by Leslie Esdaile, I know that I will not be disappointed.  She is one of the few authors who, in the space of one novel, can make me laugh, cry and reaffirm my faith in the power of true love.  Esdaile has truly mastered her ability to create a beautiful, touching love story with characters you can identify with.  She also writes in everyday language, something I can relate to, and not the oftentimes stilted, flowery phrases that are so prevalent in so many other romance novels.

His first assignment is to protect the insufferable Alexandra Radford and her royal Indian charge from possible assassination. Aidan is on the alert, because a woman like Alexandra could make him want to live again.<br /><br />Alexandra thinks of only one word when she sees Aidan: trouble. She doesn't want him protecting her, because she fears she will lose herself in a lustful encounter.Thoughts of him already continue to run through her mind.

Following the rules...	Rules are meant to be broken right?  Or at least bent a little bit depending on the situation?  The answer...a big resounding NO!  Madison Maguire, or Li'l Mama as she is called by her family, has the ultimate set of rules for dating.  Never invite your date back to your place.  Never date a married man. Never spend more than five minutes waiting on a late date.  You would think that with a list of rules that include the ones mentioned, plus many more, Madison would adhere to the most basic, the most common sense, the most important dating rule of all - always practice safe sex!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Madison doesn't follow this rule as often as she should, and when one mistake comes back to haunt her, her life is drastically changed.  How will Madison deal with the fallout?  Will her family and loved ones be the support that she needs?<br /><br />LI'L MAMA'S RULES is definitely a must read for everyone, but especially young adults. It is so intense, so real, that I often found myself with tears in my eyes and chill bumps across my body.  I commend Jackson for tackling so many serious situations in a manner that is not so clinical in nature that even the youngest person can understand.  I will definitely be recommending this book my daughter and all the young adults in my family in hopes that it affects them the way it did me...the way it was intended to affect its readers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Helping Yourself	Has life pitched you so many curve balls that you wonder if you're playing baseball or volleyball?  Have you received so many lemons that you could start a lemonade company? Are you searching for a rope that will aid you out of a hole? Well, help is on the way. In Mark Schwartz's book, A BETTER LIFE AHEAD, suggestions for improving the quality of your life are just a few chapters away.<br /><br />Within the pages of Schwartz's motivational guide are stories, advice, and adages, all intended to help the reader improve their current station in life.  What he offers are mere suggestions, nothing more, nothing less.  If you are looking for real answers, step-by-step programs, clinical observations, or a deeper understanding of why you are where you are, look somewhere else.  (This point is also mentioned in a disclaimer at the beginning of the book.)  Most of what is included in A BETTER LIFE AHEAD is common sense, although it is motivational in nature. Schwartz's positive voice saturates the work, and he does offer motivation, just as his subtitle promises.  The main point throughout this book is that if you want help, you need to help yourself.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Give Me MORE...	Some people are fortunate enough to have the reigns of life firmly in their grasp, even if just for a moment.  Good job, self-control, supportive family, plenty of money in the bank, good looks: nothing is out of place at that moment in time for them.  However, in order for the grass to grow, the rain must fall.  And in Robin R. Pendleton's novel MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW, the skies promptly open up and pour conflict on everyone. For protagonist Rene Talbot, her firm grasp on life quickly turns to mush as she races through problem after problem.  Faced with turmoil from her failed relationship with her fianc&eacute;, excessive pressure from her high-profile, confidential job, and the various mishaps of her eclectic group of friends, Rene tosses her cares out the window and heads away on vacation.  Her trip to paradise proves to be much more than she bargained for, and unfortunately, it in no way prepares her for the escalated drama she returns home to.<br /><br />While Pendleton has revealed an excellent story idea, there is one fundamental problem that detracts from an otherwise great novel. The story flows way too fast. Even though I appreciate Pendleton not spoon-feeding me every single iota of detail, this plot is too noteworthy for the quick brush over it received. There was not enough time, space, nor wording allotted for exposition, character development, or even thorough plot development.  Even the sentences ran together so fast and abruptly that it was difficult to keep up with what was occurring and to clearly see who was speaking.  With that said, I would like to mention that Pendleton's style is interesting, but takes a number of pages to get adjusted to. She commands the reader to think. The story of Rene is a captivating tale (so much so that I wanted to see what would happen next); however, I wish it could have marinated longer in the spices of detail.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Give God the Glory!	A beautifully designed spiritual booklet that speaks volumes of God's Word describes GIVE GOD THE GLORY! LET YOUR LIGHT SO SHINE by Kevin Wayne Johnson.<br /><br />In the beginning, Mr. Johnson eloquently explains the term \\"light\\" and its association with the Holy Bible. Each page quotes a scripture and a brief sermon reflecting God's Word by the author. Being small in size and pages, it's a great booklet to take along with you wherever you may go and would like to read some biblical inspirations.<br /><br />Kevin Wayne Johnson is founder of the Writing for the Lord Ministries and author of the GIVE GOD THE GLORY! Series.  I enjoyed each page and verse and recommend this book to all that enjoy reading the spiritual words of God. I also look forward to reading his other GIVE GOD THE GLORY series as well.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br /><br />Of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Hello Sweet	A moment arrives in every lifetime when a person must say goodbye.  Sometimes it's painful; sometimes it's joyful. Sometimes a goodbye can be sweet, but tragically necessary.  In her debut novel SWEET BYE-BYE, author Denise Michelle Harris bestows upon the literary community a gift: a beautifully realistic story of a woman who learns when to say bye-bye.<br /><br />Caught up in the glitter and glamour of materialism, Chantell Meyers works hard to show the world that she has it all.  However, after almost losing her father, the princess realizes that some things in her life need to go.  Determined to be a \\"good person\\" and live right, Chantell says hello to church and begins to say goodbye to the things she once cherished.  What ensues is a torrent of events that exposes her deepest pains, cleanses her from misconceptions, and transforms her into a true woman of God.<br /><br />Sincere, authentic, heartfelt, sweetly powerful: these are just a few words that describe Harris' depiction of Chantell's journey.  SWEET BYE-BYE surreptitiously drew me in and, before I knew it, morning snuck up on me, and I had read the entire novel.  Quiet and unimposing, this is Christian fiction at its best.  Even though I had a love/hate relationship with Chantell (she could be so aggravating!), I enjoyed the believable drama; nothing was over-the-top.  The spiritual aspect was on point, and everything was delivered right on time and was specific and appropriate without being preachy or judgmental.  I felt the romance was honest and sweet without being sickly sentimental or predictable.  Harris has done an excellent job telling of Chantell's inner and outer struggle to be free from her encumbering, self-imposed viewpoints, and scenes from her life will forever be lodged in my memory.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Positive Solutions	A rich and painful past has helped to shape the African-American community into the diverse, resilient and unique group that it is today. Yet, the community still faces a multitude of challenges both within and out. There are times when the future of African-Americans seems bleak and uncertain. Grim statistics warn us about the dismal rates of Black-on-Black crime, poverty and disease, to name a few. Many question what should and needs to be done to ensure the longevity of a people and community. Michael W. Cromwell has created fifty-five positive steps that can be taken to help guarantee a more prosperous community and self. Cromwell's suggestions cover the psychological, physical and spiritual ways in which we as individuals and a race can embark on a journey of awakening, healing, and renewal.<br /><br />Cromwell's steps are well laid out and easy to comprehend. He tackles issues that are relevant to the race today while reflecting on the challenges and triumphs of yesterday. Cromwell writes with an intelligence, straight-forwardness and sensitivity needed to conquer the topics covered in the book. FIFTY-FIVE POSITIVE STEPS BLACKS CAN TAKE TO PRESERVE THEMSELVES INTO THE 21st CENTURY is a well thought out book that adequately addresses the social and moral combats within the African-American community. It also does an excellent job in giving effective ways of combating these ills. The book was clearly written from the love and pride that the author feels for his people. He presents himself as a concerned citizen of the community who has not only written a self-help manual but also lived every step presented. The book would have been excellent and extremely highly recommended if the author had only taken greater precautions in proofreading it. Such a great voice did not need the distractions, however, in spite of the typographical errors the message was not lost. I am sure this book will generate much needed reflection of self and community to all who read its pages.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Anything for Love	In her sophomore offering, SACRIFICE THE ONE, author Monica P. Carter introduces readers to the Armstrong family.  Rose Armstrong had almost everything that her heart desired.  She had a wonderful marriage with her husband Robert, a nice home, and a good family.  The only thing that was missing is a child.  After many unsuccessful attempts at having a child, against doctor orders, Rose becomes pregnant and vows to have the baby even if it kills her.  Ultimately, Rose succumbs and Robert is left with their baby, Rosetta Love, \\"Seta.\\"<br /><br />At first Robert is overly protective and obsessive with the baby, but when he uncovers secrets regarding Rose and her pregnancy, he lashes out at the only person around him, his baby girl. He takes her to live with her grandparents and tries to sever all ties.<br /><br />Seta grows up trying to be the perfect daughter in order to gain her father's love and attention.  She becomes an honor roll student and a star athlete.  When she sees that being good is getting her nowhere with her father, she begins to rebel by drinking, hanging out with the wrong crowd, and searching for the love and acceptance she never received from him.  Seta soon learns her actions have consequences and that she has to live her life for herself, with or without her father.<br /><br />Monica P. Carter has crafted an excellent novel that deals with grief, love, lies, and loss.  The characters were true to life and the story enthralled me from beginning to end. I recommend SACRIFICE THE ONE to anyone looking for an emotional, family-oriented, quick read.	2004-10-09

The psyche of a man in prison	They say a mind is a terrible thing to waste.  Being in prison can not only rob one of their freedom but also the right to fully and completely exercise the human mind.  Imprisonment can also rob a man of his dignity and his ability to love.  It takes one with determination and focus to turn a long-term prison sentence into a positive while remaining lucid and surviving the pitfalls of such an environment.  In T.H.U.G. LOVE, SUPERMAN, HOW YOU?!, we meet Bliz, an individual sentenced to a long-term stint in the New York State Correctional Facility.  With time on his hands to reflect and analyze, Bliz compiles several letters to a friend addresses as Kid in which he reveals all the lessons he's learned about life and choices.  His opinions cover an array of topics that move from love to the Hip Hop culture to present day politics and anything in between. He also goes the distance with explaining prison life and the impact it can have on a person.<br /><br />Bliz provides an intense look into the psyche of a man locked within the prison walls.  His letters allow the reader to look into what actually happens inside those walls.  He shows the mental fortitude it takes to stay current with the world outside, remain alert to the signs of danger inside and how to appreciate love from behind bars.  This book is an interesting concept; however, I found the letters to be a long, arduous read and lacking some editing, which translated into an average read for me.  With that said, I do feel that young men contemplating a life of crime should take a look at this book.  He covers very well what really happens on the other side of the prison walls and what he's missed out on because of the choices he made.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Looking For Love in All the Wrong Places	Debut author D.L. Christie chronicles the life and loves of a young girl in her novel, TAKE TIME 2 KNOW HIM.  Since her early teens, Deidre \\"De\\" Dickerson looked for love in all of the wrong places.  While visiting her grandmother for the summer during her thirteenth year, De develops her first crush, Willie Roberts.  Despite the fact that Willie is known as a \\"love `em and leave `em\\" type of guy, De thinks that his feelings for her are different.  Eventually he steals her heart, her virginity, and leaves her alone and pregnant.  Devastated by her loss, De decides that Willie may desire her more if she is with someone else, so she turns her affections to Bernard Carter, \\"Scooter.\\"<br /><br />Scooter has been smitten with De since the first time he saw her when they were children.  After an extremely short courtship, he marries her and they move to Delaware.  Although De is not certain that she is in love with him, she does feel that he will be a good father for her son, Kwasi, and she tries to make the best out of her situation.  But Scooter has a deadly secret that ultimately may tear the marriage apart.<br /><br />After her drama with Scooter, De moves on, but she continues to rush into relationships.<br /><br />Through all the heartbreaks, rejections, trials, and tribulations, De learns valuable lessons about herself, but is it enough to transform her from a naïve young girl to a more confident, self-assured woman?<br /><br />The title, TAKE TIME 2 KNOW HIM, has a dual meaning.  De always rushed into relationships, giving her mind, body, and soul without really ever taking time to communicate with her potential mates.  Most of her relationships were based around sex, and in retrospect, she found that many of her situations could have been prevented if she had taken time to get to know the people she became involved with.  The second meaning has a spiritual connotation.  Through her journeys, De also learns the importance of getting to know God and letting his will be done.<br /><br />D.L. Christie has penned an excellent debut novel.  The characters are people that we all know: women who let men take advantage of them, and men who prey on the insecurities of women.  The story flowed well, however, the novel begins with De being diagnosed with a disease and throughout the story there is no evidence of her illness, nor is it mentioned in the end (perhaps there is a sequel in the works that will address that issue).  Overall, TAKE TIME 2 KNOW HIM is an excellent novel that addresses the issues of promiscuity, drug abuse, domestic violence, and abandonment, and teaches the pitfalls of rushing into relationships without taking time to REALLY get to know a person.will be done. <br /> <br />D.L.

God-centered	Have you ever reached for a book solely based on its title alone in hopes that it would offer something different, maybe a piece of insight that hadn't crossed your mind before?  Well, that's what I did with A GUIDE ON SPIRITUAL GROWTH: HOW SHOULD THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FULL FIGURED WOMAN RESPECT HER INNER SELF AS WELL AS HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE.  I thought the concept was unique in writing a motivational book that would inspire a full-figured woman in particular.  Yet, I was somewhat disappointed in reading this book. Not that it didn't contain an uplifting message,  however, anyone could have read this book and gleamed something from it.  In my opinion, it was inspirational but did not specifically cater to a full-figured woman.<br /><br />In A GUIDE ON TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH: HOW SHOULD THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FULL FIGURED WOMAN RESPECT HER INNER SELF AS WELL AS HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE, there were pearls of wisdom that would resonate within anyone who's spirit was ready to receive the information.  Ms. Cohen urges her readers to be God-fearing trusting and believe in Him for everything.  She speaks to developing one's own inner beauty and focusing on positive things in our life.  She delves into the 4 steps of soul cleansing - mediation, positive energy, correct posture and vision - that she feels will liberate a person's realization of self.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a quick read.  Although there were a few minor grammatical errors that a good editor could easily catch, this book would definitely speak to someone in their time of need.  I feel that Ms. Cohen's speaks to not only full-figured women but could inspire anyone - male or female, large or small.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
A Little Respect	Raised with the knowledge that his mother is the only woman that loves him, Marcus Brooks writes his novels with the male perspective in mind.  Fed up with the attitude portrayed by the stunningly handsome national best-selling author, Second Pew Book Club members Raylene, Naomi, Thelma, Gwena and Latice, along with every other book club in Dallas are upset over the title of his latest release. They stage a boycott when Marcus is scheduled to appear on a locally televised male talk show.<br /><br />While walking to their cars after attending a concert, the ladies witness a confrontation between a man and a woman.

After witnessing first-hand the enormity of his disrespect for women, they hatch a plan to kidnap him and teach him a lesson on respect.<br /><br />HE HAD IT COMING not only centers on Marcus's trials and tribulations, but it delves into the lives of each character and the problems they face with their spouses, children and each other.

A date with destiny...	Deshawn Jamison is just as fine as he wants to be, and he knows it too.  He knows that with just a look or a smooth pick-up line, he can have any woman he wants to.  That is until he meets Anika Foxx, the best friend of his twin brother's wife Chloe.<br /><br />Anika is not impressed with Deshawn and shoots him down the first time he comes on to her.  This is a major blow to Deshawn's ego, but he doesn't let that deter him.  He is bound and determined to win her over if it's the last thing he does.  Against her better judgment, Anika finally breaks down and agrees to spend time with Deshawn.  Deshawn's plan backfires when he realizes that the time he spent with Anika was real, causing him to finally feel some real emotions.  Unfortunately for Deshawn, Anika overhears part of a conversation between he and his brother that confirms her belief that he was out for one thing, and one thing only.  Will this revelation destroy any hope of there ever being something serious between the two?<br /><br />Niobia Bryant is an up and coming author who has quickly become someone whose works I make it a point to look out for.  HEAVENLY MATCH is a wonderfully romantic story with an air of mystery and suspense that draws the reader in, encouraging them to put aside everything and everyone until they have read the book in its entirety.

Single & Waiting	In SINGLE & WAITING, Dr. Jacqueline Lawrence shares some of the dating dilemmas she has encountered as a single, Christian, African-American woman.  In an impressive medley of poetry, thoughts, and inspiration she encourages women to set their sights on God, please Him, and avoid the many temptations that arise in dating.  She also teaches that women must first become whole and complete instead of looking for a man to complete us.<br /><br />Many single women become set on being in a relationship and are led to settle for someone who isn't necessarily the person for them.  Dr. Lawrence teaches against this and instead urges women to be happy with being single and afford extra time to being in devotion with God.  A definite asset to the book are the various poems -- poems in which it's obvious the author has reached deep into her past experiences -- poems many women will immediately relate to.  By reading her words, one can hopefully pick up the necessary pieces, regain their confidence and faith in God, and also learn that being single may be the appropriate season for them at that particular time.  SINGLE & WAITING is an enlightening book; one I would definitely recommend to those unable to celebrate who they are or those who are unsatisfied in being single.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Words Remain	Black, feminist, lesbian, mother, and warrior poet are all words that Audre Lorde used to describe herself.  Her professional accomplishments are unquestionable; she authored several collections of poetry, was a National Book Award nominee, published a work of fiction that she called a biomythography, was a professor, editor and publisher.  Her personal life was also quite complicated; it included difficult childhood, growing up legally blind, and her battle with cancer.  CONVERSATIONS WITH AUDRE LORDE helps readers better understand Lorde as an individual and bring deeper meaning to the dichotomous aspects of her personality.<br /><br />The interviews span approximately 15 years, and are conducted by a range of interviewers.  As a result, the collection is thorough and reflects the evolution and growth of Lorde both as a poet and as a person.  They illustrate her undying commitment to her beliefs and values.  While some of the interviews in the collection are redundant, it is understandable that multiple interviewers would be interested in the same topics.<br /><br />This compilation is a wonderful testament to the life of Audre Lorde.  It gives fans and even those who are not familiar with her work the opportunity to find out what she was like.  Audre Lorde was a complicated person who tried to reflect the various aspects of her personality into her body of work and through her political involvement.  Although she is no longer living, her words live on.  I highly commend Joan Wylie Hall for putting together this noteworthy collection.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09

Born in a rural poverty-stricken area of Tennessee, the author shares both her experiences growing up in the Jim Crow era, and the experiences that she endured growing up in a broken home.<br /><br />She later tells of the difficulties she had to conquer being involved in an abusive marriage and raising six children while first earning her high school diploma, later going to college, and eventually earning her Master's degree.  The book is also a tribute to her mother, sisters, and other family members who helped her achieve success.<br /><br />PERSEVERANCE LANE shows one woman's strength to go against the odds and become successful.  Though her life was filled with pain, sorrow, and struggles, the author still held on to her faith in God, and was able to persevere. PERSEVERANCE LANE is a true testimony to what one can accomplish through faith and hard work.	2004-10-09
Next Step, Recovery	September 11th will forever be a day of separation and loss for many families all over the world. In ABUNDANT RAIN, Vanessa Miller tells the story of a family who deals with years of grief over a loved one whose body was never recovered. She also shares a narrative on just how strong the love between a husband and wife can be.<br /><br />Visiting New York for their wedding anniversary, Kenneth Underwood is in one of the towers when they fall.  As Elizabeth frantically searches for him, the angels sent to guard him fight to protect his injured body from the demons sent to destroy him.  During the spiritual battle, firemen drag Kenneth to a Red Cross center. Elizabeth never finds him. Even though she has two young daughters who need her support, she never fully recovers emotionally, and her family suffers terribly.  Set financially, Elizabeth decides to pursue her singing career in Gospel music, incorporating a façade of trust in a God who she honestly feels let her down. Years later Kenneth returns injured, physically and mentally, although he has a new, positive outlook on life. Will their marriage survive all the changes? Will their family recover after being separated for years without so much as a hello? Will they once again be able to pray together?<br /><br />Vanessa Miller has penned a good, strong storyline with decent character development. I loved the prologue and epilogue, both of which shed light on spiritual warfare.  ABUNDANT RAIN deals with real life issues and really brings Christianity \\"home.\\" Kenneth and Elizabeth had to work really hard to save their marriage. Also, the problems they faced together and while they were separated were valid - their struggling walk with God was genuine. I appreciate that real world aspect. This novel has the capability to speak to the masses because the characters don't accept God's word lightly but argue and fight with Him because they are truly hurting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did have a few problems with the book. First, it was written in a standoffish 3rd person point of view. This story would be so much more effective if it was more personal to the reader. Also, Miller uses a lot of \\"Tommy said, Andrew did, Elizabeth saw.\\" Making effective use of pronouns and longer, fuller sentences would help avoid choppy, distant text.  The story also moves very quickly, dying out towards the end and transforming into a sermon.  More depth, increase scene setup, and more descriptive<br /><br />storytelling would have improved this book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthe book.

The path to financial freedom	Have you ever been broke, busted and disgusted?  Do you live paycheck to paycheck?  If you answered yes, then INVESTING IN THE DREAM is the book for you.<br /><br />Author Jesse B. Brown states, \\"prosperity has a spiritual basis - it is a divine right.\\"  He provides sound rationale as to how we can turn our negative financial situation into a positive one by developing an investment plan and making savvy financial decisions.  Even if it is a small amount, the up front sacrifice will ultimately blossom into a financial blessing.<br /><br />From stocks and bonds to everything in between, Brown not only provides insight into the mysteries of investing, but also reinforces his point by using real world examples.  By following five simple steps, we can gain financial freedom according to Brown.  These five steps are develop a long-term investment plan; max out tax-deferred retirement plan contributions; review investment goals on a regular basis; follow sound advice and hire a financial advisor to keep you on track.<br /><br />All in all, INVESTING IN THE DREAM runs the gamut of financial advice.  In addition to stocks, bonds and the tax-deferred investment vehicles, Brown also touches on credit card debt, debates about vehicle purchases and provides guidance on home purchases as well.  The information in the book is presented simply, and in an easy-to-understand format.  At times, Brown seems to be somewhat preachy, but there is no doubt that he knows the investment business.

I applaud the author for creating a cast of multicultural characters and exploring issues that real teenagers experience.  I was a bit confused by Kendren's past and some of the events seemed a bit farfetched, but it did not take away from the novel as a whole.  Overall Celise Downs has written a humorous, suspenseful novel that is a delight for teen readers.	2004-10-09
Thug Lovin' on the DL	Asante Kahari's HOMO THUG, takes the reader into the life of Michael Fraser, a convicted felon who is about to serve his first adult sentence in prison.  Michael learned crime before he learned the facts of life and enters prison as a sexually frustrated virgin. Throughout his time in juvenile detention centers, Fraser saw mild homosexual acts, which intrigued him as much as they disgusted him.  When he goes to prison he is in a whole new world where anything goes.<br /><br />Michael quickly assimilates into the prison community and moves up the ranks to become one of the most powerful inmates.  He has money, power, and respect, but lacks love.  Michael seeks love and finds it in the form of Derrick \\"Dee Dee\\" Jenkins a fellow inmate who has taken so many feminine hormones that he actually resembles a woman.  His first encounters with Dee Dee are considered mild to some, but soon an all out love affair blossoms.  Circumstances terminate their relationship and later both are released from prison.<br /><br />After his release, Michael is finally able to consummate with members of the opposite sex.  Although he thoroughly enjoys sex with women, he still yearns for feelings that he experienced with men.  Ultimately, Michael will have to do a great deal of soul-searching to find out who or what it is that he desires, and risks having his secret longings for men destroy everything he has.<br /><br />HOMO THUG is a drama filled, quick read that drew me in from the very beginning.  The story unfolded well and the characters were intriguing.  The book served as an eye-opener to some of the experiences that occur in prisons and the circumstances under which many thugs partake in \\"down low\\" homosexual lifestyle.  Despite the book's allure, I found myself struggling through it because there were so many distracting grammatical and typographical errors.  However, Asante Kahari is to be commended for penning such an eye-opening, entertaining read.	2004-10-09
God's Healing is Thorough	We all go through trials and tribulations in our lives; however, the difference in how we overcome is whether we succumb to the anguish or put our faith in God. Even though situations might not reflect it as such, God's healing is thorough.  He promises to never abandon us, and as we continue in our journey, He will heal us. This very sentiment is clearly expressed in Monica Young-Freeman's novel LOOSED: AS I WENT I WAS HEALED.<br /><br />The main character Jada tells readers of her different life situations and how she overcame. She doesn't hide for a second that she was only able to recover from the attacks of the devil because of her heavenly Father.  Growing up in a single parent home with little love and attention, Jada experienced a rough childhood and an even more turbulent adolescence.  Verbal abuse kept her from truly experiencing the love of God in her life, and although she tried to find peace in other religions, she wound up back in her childhood church. Through the deadly behavior of her deranged ex-husband and other family problems, Jada trusted in the Lord, continued to pray and help others, and was abundantly blessed with love and support from her church members.<br /><br />LOOSED: AS I WENT I WAS HEALED is one woman's struggle to find God and stay focused on Him. The book is an extremely quick read and reads like an interview, although the interviewer is never identified.  The fact that the story is written in almost question and answer format makes it very choppy. I enjoyed Jada's voice and wished she had just told her story without interruption. I also would have liked for Young-Freeman to allow Jada to tell her story in chronological order as opposed to in random sections of her life. For example, she told about her childhood, her husbands, and then about her church attendance/ministry. She then circled back to her second husband and then to her relationship with her mother. Most of the story was occurring at the same time in her life, but it is difficult for the reader to realize that until the end of the book.  I did love the main character's complete acknowledgment of God's will being done in her life. I also enjoyed the introduction and how each chapter closes. The scripture reference section at the end is thorough and very beneficial.  Overall, Jada's story ministered to me, but I truly wish a lot more detail had been included.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerst is difficult for the reader to realize that until the end of the book.

The Odd Couple	Las Vegas showgirl Lainie Terrell has to leave town fast. The abusive father of her five-year-old son suddenly decided he wants their child. Joey Benjamin owes some really bad people some really big money. He doesn't give a damn about his son. He never claimed Dexter and hasn't even told his family the kid exists. But things have changed. Joey's billionaire father wants a grandson, and Joey plans on using this kid to obtain the money he needs. Now if he could only get rid of Lainie. There's no way he can take a showgirl home to \\"Daddy.\\"<br /><br />Lainie doesn't know what Joey is up to, but she knows it's no good. She turns to her friend Harry Ambrewster for help, but she's apprehensive because she has feelings for Harry-feelings that could change their relationship from just friends. She knows he could never accept a woman like her in that way-or could he?<br /><br />Harry Ambrewster, accountant and genius extraordinaire, has to save Lainie and her son Dexter from this drunken madman who came banging on her door claiming to be the child's father. Harry sneaks the two out of town to his mother's. His mother, a former showgirl, comes up with this crazy scheme to help keep Lainie and Dexter safe while she matchmakes between Harry and Lainie. If everything works out for his mother, she'll have a daughter-in-law and a grandson by the end of this ordeal.<br /><br />While I was reading THE NERD WHO LOVE ME, my children came to check on me a few times. They couldn't understand why their mother who was in a quiet room, sitting in a chair, reading a book would just burst out in hysterical fits of laughter. The cast of characters, both main and secondary, were well-developed and fun to read about.

The DIVA In You	When you think of the word DIVA what do you think of? Do you think of someone who is overconfident, conceited and thinks it's all about them?

She emphasizes their strengths as well as their weaknesses and delves into what it is that makes them a diva. At the end of each chapter there are: diva confessions, which is a positive affirmation; diva do's and don'ts, which allow us to know exactly what a diva should and shouldn't do, for example \\"Do not seek to control, manipulate, or cause others to be dependent on you. This weakens you both in the long run\\" and finally there are div-otions which includes a scripture and a prayer. As a special bonus included at the end of the book is a diva-licious week of recipes to whet your diva appetite.<br /><br />Inspiring, motivating and spiritually uplifting THE DIVA PRINCIPLE is indeed a must have for every woman no matter what their ethnicity.

Corporate love...	Sebastian Harmon is a spoiled, pampered rich boy who has never had to do any hard work, nor has he ever taken anything seriously in his whole life.  His parents realize they are to blame and finally decide to do something about it; they take an unexpected six month vacation, leaving the family business, Harmon Department Stores, in Sebastian's hands.  During his six month tenure, Sebastian must improve the company's financial projections by ten percent, or he'll lose everything.<br /><br />Alexandra Bramble is the founder of Jhoni Cosmetics which, without a major promotional contract, will soon face serious financial difficulties.  When Alexandra's friend hears of her plight, he discusses it with Sebastian, with whom he has been friends with for years.<br /><br />Alexandra agrees to meet with Sebastian, and although she is not impressed with Sebastian's business technique, the realization that she could lose her company prompts her to give him a chance.  Because of their close working relationship, a mutual attraction develops.  It's not all wine and roses though, simply because Alexandra has a secret that she fears will ruin her if it ever gets out.  What will happen?  Will Alexandra find that her fears were all for naught?<br /><br />HARD TO LOVE is your typical romance novel, with a little bit of intrigue to spice things up a bit.  Normally I am a sucker for a good romance story, but unfortunately this novel left something to be desired.  There was nothing that made it stand out, nor did it evoke any emotions in me, other than frustration with the characters.  They were shallow and pretentious, and the shame Alexandra felt because of what she believed was a dirty little secret that could ruin her good name, disturbed me quite a bit.  In the end though, they manage to redeem themselves somewhat.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
A Diamond in the Rough	In FROM A HARD ROCK TO A GEM by Pamela M. Johnson we meet Diamond Faith Sterling, a beautiful girl who resides in the inner city of Oakland.

She desires to be respected amongst those in the streets and have plenty of money and power. Her wish comes true as she starts out simply selling drugs but ends up being at the top of the game.

But Diamond is determined to not only survive but also gain a fortune along the way. What I enjoyed most about this book is that it's real, and if you grew up in the inner city or know someone that did, characters in this book are easily recognizable. Although you can't choose where you grow up, you can make the most of your situation and not allow your environment to determine who you become. Allow yourself the opportunity to step outside the box and be all that you can be.<br /><br />Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinnin<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
The Outline for a Love Story	Love.  Every person who glances upon that word, mutters that word, or hears that word feels something stir in that deep place barely beyond reason.  But what exactly does it mean and how exactly can one achieve it? Some people search actively for it while others sit by and wait patiently for it. CLIMBING THE LADDER TO LOVE is the story of a woman who chose to search.<br /><br />All through her life, Ruby was a smart, attractive woman; however, she could never seem to conquer the area of love. She dated, trusted, and opened herself up to men she assumed would be true to her, but every single relationship ended in failure. Resolved to get married and be in love, Ruby never stops searching. Finally, after years of crying, hurting, and trying to wish away the love scars, the heavens decide to give her someone to love her enough to say, \\"yes\\".<br /><br />CLIMBING THE LADDER TO LOVE by Marla D. Jackson is a quick, unfulfilling read. Her story idea is interesting, however, the characters are undeveloped, the plot is glazed over, and the story is told in a very rushed, standoffish, third person point of view.  The narrative reads more as an outline to a larger, grander novel - one that I would be enthusiastic about reading since she does birth some thought-provoking observations throughout the novel.  I really regret that I wasn't given the opportunity to get to know Ruby because her troubles and trials were not abnormal.  Unfortunately, the potential to learn much from this story is forever buried under unfulfilled ability.<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Show Stopper	DIVALICIOUS is a very captivating story about three African-American females who star in a sitcom entitled Brave New World.  After one of the stars leaves the show, the producers replace her with a white woman. Angel Hart and Erika Bishop wonder what will become of the show when blond bombshell Faith Maloney enters the picture.<br /><br />Angel is the trustworthiest of the trio.  Her problems stem from her \\"no strings attached\\" motto as it pertains to men.  So she spends her time dating single men she knows she can never have.  While out on the town she runs into Brave's newest writer, the enticingly gorgeous Lucien Alexander.  After a steamy conversation over cocktails and the events that ensue, Angel discovers that she has bitten off a little more than she can chew.<br /><br />Erika, the rambunctious one of the bunch, enacts the no-holds-barred approach when it comes to achieving stardom.  She is backed by an even vicious mother, who is living her failed dreams of becoming a star through her daughter.  Erika is carrying around a little secret that could not only destroy her career but the show as well.<br /><br />Faith, who should have the word naive stamped across her forehead, is just happy to be amongst the working class.  She welcomes the change in her life while hiding from a shady past and an even more sinister lover.  When she meets Brave's creator, the breathtakingly handsome and married Randall Hunter, the mutual attraction is instant.  Faith may learn a lesson or two in life after being privy to the depths of his infidelity.<br /><br />The saga encased in the pages of DIVALICIOUS reads like a soap opera.  Once I was drawn into the storyline I could not put the book down.  It seemed as if I was watching it unfold on a television screen rather than just reading words in a book.  Darrious D. Hilmon is to be commended for his excellent writing skills.  I am looking forward to reading other titles by this very talented author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersPamela Bolden <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2004-10-09
The same old cycle, over and over again	The same old cycle, over and over again<br /><br />Two friends find themselves amidst situations that are not only bad for them, but are also endless cycles of self-deprivation.  Daryl-<br /><br />Lynn Davis, known as Darlin to her family and friends, is intelligent, street-savvy, and an entrepreneur.  She has her own business and knows how to handle herself in the myriad of situations that cross her path.  Nakaiya \\"Kai\\" Smith is a bit younger, yet with<br /><br />her own set of attributes that make her stand out in the crowd.<br /><br />Kai is from Indiana and accustomed to being surrounded by her loving family.  She's been sheltered much of her life, but after her aunt's death, she takes flight and heads to Chicago to study art.  Kai moves into Darlin's building and Darlin immediately takes her under her wings, schooling her on the ways of life in the big city.<br /><br />The two women start a friendship and pop into each other's lives occasionally, but during the other times, they are each dealing with<br /><br />their relationships with men.  Darlin is in love with her boyfriend of quite a few years and has invested her complete being into her<br /><br />relationship.  She's gone so far as to center her world around him and help him in all his endeavors because she sees the potential he has to do great things in his life.  When she's sure they're getting ready to commit to one another for life, he announces that he's<br /><br />involved with someone else and is no longer interested in the relationship with Darlin.  He then goes on to marry the other women.<br /><br />She completely shuts down, has a mental breakdown and through the help of a friend, finally brings herself out of the prison she's<br /><br />locked herself into.  And, just when things are looking better for her...the ex pops back into her life claiming his mistake and love<br /><br />for her, but get this:  he's not willing to leave his wife (nor the child on the way).  Surprisingly, Darlin falls for his claims of love and<br /><br />resorts to having any little piece of him she can have to keep him in her life.<br /><br />Kai on the other hand has other issues.  She has never been in a real relationship, so when she meets someone who catches her interest, she falls quickly, gives up the goods and puts up with things from the beginning that many naive women have fallen for.  However, when things get rocky, she immediately hops in bed with the next guy and once her conscience kicks in, she goes back to her boyfriend, positive that she can work things out.  This cycle continues over and over throughout the book and both women suffer not only heartache, but also the inability to break the cycle and move on...or do they?  Once you've grown accustomed to doing something the same way repetitively, can you indeed break the cycle?  Can you look in the mirror and really like who you see?<br /><br />I tried to understand these characters and their actions, but in all honestly, I was sickened and in total disbelief over their antics to<br /><br />keep their \\"men.\\"  The abundance of Kai's hopping from bed to bed (without even the hint of protection), to Darlin's motto of knowing it all, yet she seemed pretty inexperienced when all the cards were laid on the table.  I had no connection whatsoever with these characters.  Perhaps if more time had been spent toward developing them a bit more, as well as beefing up the dialogue (which seemed repetitive from man to man),  I possibly could've enjoyed the book a bit more.  There were also a few grammatical errors throughout the book.<br /><br />In spite of my disappointment, I could appreciate the theme of friends sticking beside each other through the rough times.  Also, as the title implies, the grass really isn't always greener on the other side.  Instead, it all depends on where you're standing and what you're willing to do for your version of happiness.  In the case of our two main characters, they really needed to spend some time working on themselves and understanding their self-worth versus relying on a man to complete them or validate their existence.  Either that or get some fertilizer or something for their own grass.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Capturing Culture	How often have we sat at the feet of our elders and heard stories imparted to us regarding the days gone by?  Handed down through the generations, these tales were not only meant for entertainment purposes, they impart wisdom and provide a living lesson. In 400 YEARS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FOLKLORE, author Daryl Cumber Dance has created a compilation of folktales, folk music - including spirituals and freedom songs - as well as blues and ballads, folk arts and crafts, proverbs and many other pearls of wisdom that breed familiarity in the Black community.  The African slave trade tore our early ancestors from their native lands, stripping them of their individual identities and beliefs, yet our strong forefathers were able to maintain some of their culture and the stories that were once told to them.<br /><br />Ms. Dance does a wonderful job in capturing the vernacular used in some of the stories as well as providing some historical background to set a frame of reference for her readers.  Each story and every entry into this collection caught my attention.  I was compelled through the pages by my curiosity and to be reminded of days gone by.  Each was very well put together, yet I found my favorite folk tale to be \\"De Ways of De Wimmens\\" which is a humorous short tale revolving around Adam and Eve's first days together and the establishment of gender roles.  This story literally had me laughing out loud because even today, I can relate to the basic truth found in this tale.<br /><br />400 YEARS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FOLKLORE is not just a collection of folk tales.  Don't get me wrong, Ms. Dance does rightful justice in providing glimpses into our dynamic society.  She reaches back into the early days, guides us through the civil rights era by including powerful sermons by Reverend C.L. Franklin, Martin Luther King Jr., Jesse Jackson and many more.  She even addresses some of today's disconcerting issues, such as urban gentrification and gang violence.<br /><br />In summary, the selections included in this book run the gamut throughout the reaches of time. It provides glimpses into the strong traditions held by the Black community and imparts some wisdom as to how these traditions may have taken root.  In writing 400 YEARS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FOLKLORE, Ms. Dance stated, \\"My goal throughout my career and in this anthology has been to collect, transcribe, preserve and respect the integrity of the folk text.\\"  In my humble opinion, she did just that.  Ms. Dance should be lauded for her efforts.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers/>In summary, the selections included in this book run the gamut throughout the reaches of time.

When Love Calls	A HAPPY LIFE by Charlotte Harris portrays two strong-willed individuals, Justice Dillard and Tony Williams.  They meet under the most unusual circumstances; she is a parking enforcement officer and he is the recipient of overdue parking tickets.  Justice is a law school graduate and unlucky in love.  You may find yourself asking, as I did, \\"why is she writing parking tickets and putting boots on cars with a law degree?\\"  Tony has a prior occupation that he does not reveal and a former lover who makes it her business to reveal herself.<br /><br />At first glance, A HAPPY LIFE is a whimsical and typical romance tale of the cat and mouse chase, but as you read the pace of the story picks up and the drama and climax is tantamount to unbelievable.  The book takes you from the main characters initial meeting through their trials and those of their friends and co-workers.  The secondary characters, Justice's best friend, who happens to be a male, her co-workers and her parents to Tony's sister, his cousin and his mother, add an enormous amount of humor to the story.<br /><br />The dialogue among the characters is strong and realistic and the use of imagery is very good.  I could visualize the scenery and the characters emotions with ease.  Harris does a nice job of setting the stage for possible eternal love with obstacles along the way.  All in all, A HAPPY LIFE is a tantalizing romance.<br /><br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09

All Alone In Love	THE OTHER SIDE OF LOVE is a non-traditional May-December romance novel.  It is a tale of  two women who transcend racial boundaries but are not quite able to hurdle all of life's obstacles in order to be together.  Ella Whittington is a distinguished Caucasian woman who has had a successful career as a high school principal, and a loving family to boot.  She endures a personal drama that changes life as she knows it.  Ella becomes enthralled in a whirlwind romance with the school's music teacher, Angela Greene.  Many years her junior, Angela is a talented, beautiful Black woman who is granted the opportunity of a lifetime.  Will Ella's passion for Angie continue to burn although fate has seemingly intervened? The story is filled with sexual tension, curiosity and societal ills that culminate in a surprise ending that will leave you shaking your head.<br /><br />THE OTHER SIDE OF LOVE offers a valiant attempt at a good story line. The grammatical errors that prevail throughout this novel are a hindrance to the overall flow of the book.  The errors, such as proper punctuation and use of quotations, seem to be basic in nature and could have been easily corrected.  Also, the book is printed in a very large, cursive type font that is unusual.  With a very good editor and more in-depth character development, this novel could be competition for other popular contemporary fiction novels.  In its current state, this book lacks luster, which is sad, because the concept of this book is compelling.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-09
Bringing Wreck	When hip hop made its debut onto the urban scene in the 1970s, most saw it as a fad that would eventually fade into oblivion. Some thirty years later this culture, essentially born from urban decay, with its eclectic mix of rap music, poetry, dance, dress and attitude, has become universal.<br /><br />In her new book CHECK IT WHILE I WRECK IT, Gwendolyn Pough, assistant Professor of Women's Studies at the University of Minnesota, highlights some of the contributions of noted female rappers to hip hop and explores their impact on the evolution of the genre.<br /><br />Dr. Pough explains the phenomena of \\"bringing wreck\\" a catch phrase often used in hip hop circles, as a form of praise, to describe \\"skill and greatness.\\" The author uses this terminology to ascribe to the ways in which various female rappers; from the lyrically raunchy Foxy Brown and Lil Kim to the socially conscious Queen Latifah and Lauren Hill have brought \\"wreck\\" to the world of hip hop by causing \\"disruptions which somehow shifted the way black people were viewed in the society at large.\\" The author further expounds on the theory that the hip hop culture has the power to \\"affect change and bring wreck in a meaningful way\\" and exhorts female rappers to recognize the tremendous possibilities of hip hop and use it as a force for good.<br /><br />CHECK IT WHILE I WRECK IT is a thought-provoking, enlightening read which affords all readers a window into the world of an often misunderstood, yet extremely popular culture. At the core of this book is the author's call for female rappers to continue to \\"bring wreck\\" to the hip hop world, as they strive to carve their own niche in this essentially male dominated culture.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-10-07
Patience Is A Virtue	In UNACCUSTOMED TO WAITING, the sequel to Ladies In Waiting, Linda Hudson-Smith further develops the characters Christian readers have come to love.  Reverend Jessie Covington has recently been released from wrongful imprisonment and due to this he has seen first hand how families are affected by incarceration.  Through divine guidance he sees a need within his community that he wishes to fulfill, inspired by his wife and her undying support he begins a support group for men with incarcerated spouses and girlfriends.<br /><br />Hudson-Smith explores real and difficult issues facing families and communities today:  such as wayward children, absentee fathers, and the destruction that drugs cause, among other things.  Not only does she address these issues, she demonstrates through the fictional characters that when you believe in God and prayer, you can conquer all obstacles in your way.  The underlying message throughout the novel is to stay in prayer and stay with God.<br /><br />Christian fiction is a genre that I have not ventured into until reading, UNACCUSTOMED TO WAITING.  I half expected to read a Sunday sermon, as opposed to an interesting and nicely written novel.  I was quite wrong in my assumptions and enjoyed the literary offering of Linda Hudson-Smith.  I do, however, recommend reading Ladies In Waiting first; without doing so you may feel that you are missing pertinent information to the storyline.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-30
Ghetto Luv	Darius Santana, a.k.a. Rio has dreams of leaving the ghetto.  He has served time in prison and wants to walk the straight and narrow path, but he can't catch a break.  He receives a two-year degree while being a part-time hustler, believing that life has more to offer than the ghetto.  Because of his felony conviction, no one wants to hire him, so he reluctantly heeds the persuasive call of the streets.<br /><br />Trinity Baker has had a hard life since her mother died.  She is left to be the woman of the house, left to be caretaker and provider for her little brother Billy, and left to fulfill a role a daughter should never fill for her father.  She too has dreams of having more and looks to Rio to rescue her from her despair.<br /><br />Prince, the local drug lord, has his eye on Rio and wants to groom him to be his successor, but his oldest son Truck wants that position for himself and will stop at nothing to receive what he believes is rightfully his.  Shamel and Cutty are Rios right and left hand men, but one will prove to be his best ally and the other will be his weakest link.  Will Rio and Trinity make it out of the ghetto, or will they fall victim to the streets?<br /><br />STREET DREAMS is not for the faint of heart, it is a graphic and often gruesome depiction of the streets.  K'wan really takes his readers into the street life through his characters.  His novel is not predictable and you will not be able to foretell the ending.  It kept me interested from beginning to end.

It Takes a Nation	At one time or another, many have heard of the sentiment \\"we should have our own\\" from the Black community.  Well Aaron McGruder, creator of the highly acclaimed comic strip The Boondocks and Reginald Hudlin writer/director of the all too funny House Party, have teamed up to give readers their impression on what having our own would be like in the social satire BIRTH OF A NATION, illustrated by Kyle Baker.  The comic novel pokes fun at different areas of the Black community such as nationalism, materialism and the generational gap.<br /><br />The book opens with an illustration displaying the stark contrast between St Louis and East St. Louis.  As I viewed the illustrations, I did not find it hard to believe that the depiction was more of an accurate assessment rather than just the artist view.  As the fictional mayor Fred Fredricks of East St. Louis rounds up the citizens to vote, they are turned away because they are all listed as convicted felons - including the mayor.  This along with the persuasive tactics of the multi-billionaire, John Roberts, who has his own agenda, Fredricks decides to secede the Union.<br /><br />As the Republic of Blackland is formed, the citizens can not come to agreements on the flag, the national anthem, or whose face will appear on the paper money and coins.  The flag that is chosen to represent them is a picture of a White Jesus Christ on a red, black and green background.  The national anthem is sung to the melody of \\"Good Times,\\" and it is a toss up between rappers Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur for the face of the nickel.  To counteract their efforts to secede the Union, the president and his cabinet shut down the welfare office, the unemployment office and the post office, which means no unemployment checks, no welfare checks, and no social security checks.  Can you imagine the civil unrest?<br /><br />This social/political satire, although funny, made me think - how would the Black community handle \\"having our own,\\" and how would those efforts be thwarted by the powers that be.  I don't think it would be far-fetched from the ideas and antics presented here.  After reading BIRTH OF A NATION, it should make you go hmmmm.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersow would those efforts be thwarted by the powers that be.

Dying in the Dark	Private Investigator Tamara Hayle is back in DYING IN THE DARK, the 7th book in Valerie Wilson Wesley's mystery series.  With a back drop of Newark, New Jersey, we find our heroine contemplating life and her son's impending growing up and leaving the house.  Tamara's past has resurfaced and firmly placed itself in her life.  At first she's haunted at night by nightmares about her once best friend Celia Jones, who was murdered the previous year.  Later, things come full circle when Celia's son Cecil visits her office requesting her services.  Cecil is convinced that someone killed his mother and wants Tamara to take the case.  She reluctantly agrees, and sets on a course to get to the bottom of things, not expecting anything major to go wrong.<br /><br />Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, Cecil ends up dead also, someone breaks into Tamara's office and apartment, and she begins a wild chase to shed light on Celia's life in hopes of figuring out who killed her.  Through her investigation, she learns more of Celia's sordid past and finds that the list of possible suspects grows with each interview she has.  From the ex-husband, to the many men she was involved with, to her lesbian lover, it becomes quite clear that Celia has \\"friends\\" in high places, but could one of them be responsible for her death?<br /><br />Running parallel with the investigative work is her relationship and interaction with her son Jamal who is growing up and will soon be headed out on his own in life.  Once Cecil is killed, Tamara begins to think more about her son and his place in her life.  The love shown between the two, especially with Tamara knowing how to let go and letting her son be a young adult, gave the story more depth as we were able to see another side of Tamara's character.  When more tragic deaths occur, she's not sure if she'll be able to protect her son as she realizes the various paths available to him as a result of the issues he encounters in life.<br /><br />Valerie Wilson Wesley has presented the reader with not only an interesting mystery, but in DYING IN THE DARK we're also able to see the issues that our African-American communities must contend.  Some of these concerns include social class and status, racial injustices, crime, poverty and also the importance of family.  Through finding the culprit, readers also uncover some truths about life as we know it.<br /><br />Fans of the Tamara Hayle series will also be happy to read more about a heroine who is not only good at what she does, but tough and aggressive and at the same time, a single mom and handling her household.  While the book did move a bit slow for me at times and the mystery was easy to figure out, Tamara Hayle is an intriguing character.  Wesley did a wonderful job in the characterization and I closed the book with a feeling of saying goodbye to an old friend.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

History Comes Alive	Dr. May Edward Chinn, New York's first black female doctor, serves as the inspiration for Kuwana Haulsey's ANGEL OF HARLEM.  So often, persons of historical significance are narrowed down to brief biographical sketches, but HaulSey has truly brought the life of Dr. Chinn alive in this stirring novel.  Dr. Chinn's early childhood is explored, and her mother's lifelong commitment to her education is highlighted.  Her father's narrow views of what was considered proper for women, strict rules and emotional distance, also had a strong influence on his daughter's life.  In spite of her achievements, Dr. Chinn's life was far from easy.  She became pregnant by her high school sweetheart, who upon learning this, he promptly ended the relationship.  She was forced, by her parents, to give her child up for adoption.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that she never completed high school, she was accepted at Columbia University where she first wanted to study music.  Because of discrimination, she eventually changed her major and this led to her career as a physician.  Dr. Chinn fought discrimination on two levels, race and gender but was persistent enough to succeed in spite of these limitations.  In addition to her academic and professional accomplishments, her social life allowed her to cross paths with many notable Harlem Renaissance figures such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Fats Waller, and Madam C.J. Walker.  She also served as a pianist who accompanied Paul Robeson in many of his early performances.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful testament to the life of a truly amazing woman who was persistent enough to break down walls and bring down glass ceilings.  While there were moments when I felt the story stalled, overall the author did an excellent job.  She provided a thoroughly developed setting, and well developed characters.  With great sensitivity the author addressed through the characters such issues as the role of women in society, the color complex, discrimination, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, and poverty through the lenses of the 1920's Harlem era.  ANGEL OF HARLEM is not only an enjoyable read, but it is also a book that will encourage readers to embrace the past and make an extra effort to learn more about some of the trailblazers that have helped to make this country what it is today.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerslex, discrimination, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, and poverty through the lenses of the 1920's Harlem era.

Go for the Gold!	Whether life has handed you a bouquet of lilies or has thrown old boats at your face, we all have the power within us to be rich! \\"How?\\" you might ask. Well, it's not about what you have; it's all about who you know and what they have. In THE GOLD DIGGER'S GUIDE: How to Marry the Man and the Money, self-appointed counselor Ivana B. Rich, sets out to save the masses.  Kick that broke joke to the curb! It's time to set your sights a lot higher.  So ladies, grab a pen and a notepad because Ivana is here to show you how to get that Money Man and live the life you've always dreamed.<br /><br />Chock-full of valuable information, THE GOLD DIGGER'S GUIDE is a comical must-have for any woman aiming for the luxurious life.  First, Ivana breaks down the phrase \\"gold digger\\" and gives us a little history.  After properly educating us and encouraging us to not be afraid or embarrassed about having high standards, Ivana sets some guidelines.  The one I like the most is, \\"Always marry for love.\\" No matter how much money he has or how much you need, don't get married based solely on material things.  Okay, after the guidelines, Mrs. B. Rich gives us a little test to help determine what kind of diva we are, what kind of Money Man we need, where to find him, and how to act in our new life after the wedding.  Finally, she talks about vacation spots, throwing parties and socials, recipes to please your guests, where to shop, and legal matters (like prenuptial agreements).  The recurrent theme throughout the entire book is simply this: know your worth and don't be ashamed to expect and only settle for the best.<br /><br />When I first picked up THE GOLD DIGGER'S GUIDE my insides groaned.  \\"Oh no, not another get-the-man book.\\"  However, I am not ashamed to admit I was totally wrong about this book, and was pleasantly surprised at what I found inside the cover.  Although the title might sound shady, Ivana B. Rich has not written a text on how to scam, but instead on how to be graceful, poised, and prepared.  She educates women on how to act the part and, in essence, fake it until you make it.  She advises us to spend time doing things that matter, take care of our bodies, educate our minds, and not to try and trap a man.  Ivana's voice flows steadily and confidently throughout the book as she uses humorous stereotypes, case studies, stories, and real-life examples to illustrate her advice.  While I did enjoy THE GOLD DIGGER'S GUIDE, it has more info on how to live properly in the lap of luxury than how to get the man.  Most of the stories and advice are for after meeting and/or marrying the Money Man. However, the information presented here is still relevant and good to have as it lets readers know that it is okay to set high standards. You are worth it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />(...)epared.  She educates women on how to act the part and, in essence, fake it until you make it.

This Little Light of Mine	The light shines in this compilation of uplifting stories of the strength, power and resilience of African Americans.  From its opening story until the final chapter, the reader is standing in triumph of how wonderful we are as African Americans.  CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SOUL engages the readers with stories that inspire, empower and strengthen African-Americans.<br /><br />The stories are placed into categories that best suit the feelings that are trying to be invoked.  The chapters include:  From Strong Roots, Celebrating Family, Triumph and Resilience, Accepting Me Loving You, Praise, Worship and Prayer, Lessons Learned and Making A Difference.  There are stories written by unknown authors and authors such as Maya Angelou, Leslie Banks, Tracy Price-Thompson, Dr. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.  All the stories were wonderfully written and felt so timely in that they convey feelings of strength that one would garner from stories that relish in our beauty and strength as African Americans.  Although I enjoyed all the stories presented, there were a few that really embraced me with their warmth they include:  Fried Chicken and Collard Greens, More Alike Than Different, Cold Hands, Warm Heart, A Magical Moment With Ali and Life After Death.<br /><br />CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN SOUL builds upon the foundation of strong, resilient and purposeful people.  It illustrates that our strong groundwork has helped to make us the people that we are today.  Through slavery, discrimination, poverty and statistics that have killed many of our dreams, we still persevere and this book reinforces the realness of the culture.  Readers will be proud of this collection and no matter what race, everyone will gain a little light of understanding from a group of strong people whose souls have been enriched from the past, present and future.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-26
Love finds its way home	In HOMELESS LOVE, Nina Moore is a successful businesswoman with many things accentuating her wealth, but she is living a lonely existence.  Franklin is a saxophone player who yearns for a clear conscious and for Nina to see him as a man instead of a homeless person using her business doorway as his home.<br /><br />Nina meets Franklin unconventionally; she finds him in a drunken stupor in front of her business.  Yet, one night Franklin is able to save Nina from a very vulnerable situation and what started out as a strained affiliation slowly turns into a romantic attraction.  Although Franklin has nothing but himself and sexy saxophone tunes to offer Nina, they find they give each other much more than they realize.<br /><br />C. F. Hawthorne has crafted an unusual romance story making it believable by tackling such a disconcerting concept in a realistic fashion.  Besides the love story in this novel, the author also examines the issues of family dynamics, alcoholism and self-esteem.  I personally found the family dynamics very intriguing because of the secrets and lies fostered by Nina's family.  However, I wish she had developed the family issues and characters more in depth which would have created a stronger and more powerful story.  One other fault I found with the novel was the author seemed to rush the ending and create more questions than answers.  Readers will find HOMELESS LOVE a wonderfully unique story that extols the warm sentiment that love knows no boundaries.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-26

This is Tupac...\\"  Not only did she win the bet, she embarked on a very unusual pen pal relationship with the notorious Tupac Shakur.

What goes around...	PAYBACK'S A BITCH introduces readers to a fictional group of female vigilantes known as the 'woman hood', who reciprocate wrongs done to the community by the corrupt men of their society.  This story illustrates the dark world of drugs, sex and violence.<br /><br />Initially, readers meet the male street hustlers Cream, Drench and War, homeboys who have been friends since they hustled together in school.  War enlists Cream to help him hustle a known drug dealer as payback for hurting one of his family members.  What starts out as a simple hustle with money and few drugs stolen, turns into homicides.  We also find that one friend will betray the others.  With the appearance of the 'woman hood', the readers will find  they will protect one of the friends while causing a payback of one of the others.<br /><br />This urban novel was a quick and satisfying read.  The author grabs the reader's attention from the initial page.  Although there was violence, sex and drugs; this novel holds onto a message of hope, trust, empowerment and a positive message for men.  My only real issue with the novel is we do not find out about the 'woman hood' until almost the end of the novel.  This was probably done purposely in order to pull readers into the story and have their appetites aroused for the next installment.  One thing for sure is that Marcus Spears has shown that PAYBACK'S A BITCH. This was a good first effort by the author, and I look forward to what the 'woman hood' will be doing next.<br /><br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-26
A Tragic Legacy	In her third novel, DON'T WANT NO SUGAR, author J. D. Mason continues to mesmerize readers with her knack for storytelling. The novel begins in the 1930s with the death of Eula May Adams.  Eula May suffers from being obsessively in love with a married man, Bobby Lee.  She lives to love him and neglects everything and everybody else, including their love child, Roberta.  It is that obsession which eventually leads to the deaths of both Bobby and Eula May and leaves Roberta to move in with the local midwife, Miss Martha Armstrong.<br /><br />As Roberta matures, her resemblance to her mother is uncanny.  In addition to her looks, she also inherits her mother's obsessive personality.  She begins to yearn for Charles Brooks and stops at nothing to have him.  Eventually Charles succumbs to her advances and when Roberta winds up pregnant, he does the right thing and marries her.<br /><br />Roberta seemingly has everything she ever wanted, except the love of her husband.  Charles is unhappy with his situation.  Although he loves his children, he cannot stand the sight of his wife.  He faces a real dilemma when he meets and falls in love with Sara Tate.  Sara is everything he ever wanted in a woman and wife.<br /><br />Charles attempts to lead a double life having family lives with both Roberta and Sara.  However, when the two women find out about his deception, he learns that there is nothing worse than the wrath of a woman scorned.  The drama that ensues has a tragic and lasting effect, which continues to plague generations to come.  The story ends by introducing John King, the protagonist of One Day I Saw a Black King, and the grandson of Charles Brooks.<br /><br />Although DON'T WANT NO SUGAR is the prequel to Mason's sophomore novel, One Day I Saw a Black King, it is not necessary to read the latter, for this novel stands alone.  However, fans of Mason's previous novel will delight in seeing the ancestors of John King and this novel gives insight into how the indiscretions of his forefathers affect his actions in life.  I especially enjoyed the cast of eclectic characters and the way the novel flowed--slowly and smoothly.  Reading DON'T WANT NO SUGAR has definitely solidified J. D.

Man of my heart, I love you so	When you walk by a street musician, do you drop a dollar in the case if their notes send electricity through your veins? Do you ever wonder what the musician's story is - why they are playing on the corner rather than in a posh nightclub?  MORE THAN YOU KNOW by Rosalyn Story delves into the life of a street saxophonist, L.J. Tillman, and clarifies how he arrived at that station in his life.<br /><br />L.J. came from Kansas City to The Big Apple one night after he revealed a devastating secret to his wife, Olivia, and was then involved in a car accident. L.J. hopped a train and arrived in New York City to find himself living on the streets and playing for spare change. Back in Kansas City, the police ruled L.J. dead, despite the fact that a body never turned up. Olivia still holds on to hope, regardless of what the officials say, but after a year passes and L.J. doesn't show up, she starts to feel like it is time to let go and move on.<br /><br />MORE THAN YOU KNOW is a slow and deliberate melody - a ballad. While the plot thickens, so do the characterizations.  Story's ensemble of secondary characters and her admirable emphasis on her protagonist's character pull this tale together nicely. There were times while reading this book that I wanted to step into the story myself to hear the music, let the characters in on secrets, and just hang out. These characters became so likable and so dear to my heart that I didn't want to turn that last page.

Can you hear me now?	Sitting in a caf&eacute; in the city of his birth, George is remembering the days before his family moved to the United States. He is just a bit depressed because none of his friends from school seem to remember him. When he speaks, they walk on by. In the caf&eacute;, a very pretty young woman named Clara approaches him. He is shocked to find that she is a prostitute and even more disturbed to find that he remembers her. That's when she explains to him that they are both dead and they cannot cross the meadow until they take care of unsolved problems they left in their lifetimes. She needs to know why she is dead at such a young age. George, on the other hand, has been bothered most of his life by a recurring nightmare where he sees a dead girl buried under the bathtub of his old house. Together the two set out to solve the mystery.<br /><br />CROSSING THE MEADOW could be a depressing novel of death and despair; instead, Kfir Luzzatto has made it a testimony of hope and a promise of better things to come. There is something oddly peaceful about dead people who can see the living, stand next to them and even get them to do certain things. The living, for the most part, are unaware of the proximity of the dead. The exceptions are small children who have not lost their ability to see and believe in another world and of course, animals.

Real Issues	HEAVY ON MY MIND is the real deal.  After reading Jeff Haskins collection of poetry, I was taken aback by the realism.  His poetry does not come from a place of fantasy, but from the heart of a real Black man.  He puts real issues into poetic verse.<br /><br />His collection is divided into five sections titled \\"Sex, Love, and Intimacy\\", \\"Spirituality and Religiosity\\", \\"The Many Pieces of the Family Unit\\", \\"Politically Speaking\\" and \\"Heavy on My Mind\\".  At the start of each of these sections, Haskins gives the reader his thoughts on the subject matter and the subsequent poems follow that theme.  I found this to be rather unique.  It provided me with the opportunity to feel the extra emotion behind the poetry.<br /><br />This collection is appropriately titled HEAVY ON MY MIND.  It explores real issues that have been on the conscience of the population at one time or another.  His words properly convey the emotions, which I identified with and have experienced within my own life.  This is a well written collection of poetry.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-17

She subtly shows thought provoking examples<br /><br />of the role, or lack there of, their parents play in their postures. I<br /><br />enjoyed the emotional pull as readers were allowed to watch them choose<br /><br />when they reached that fork in the road of life.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-17
RAW Rating: 4	STRAIGHT TO THE HEART is the story of Monique Oliver's gradual<br /><br />metamorphosis. Just months away from her fortieth birthday she is given<br /><br />a pink slip by her employer of fifteen years, and about the same time<br /><br />her boyfriend ends their relationship. Monique could not have imagined<br /><br />she would be single, jobless and without prospects for either loss, at<br /><br />this stage of her life.<br /><br />After too many dismal relationships, she has  sworn off men until she<br /><br />recaptures her emotional balance. But behind each dark cloud is a silver<br /><br />lining, and for Monique it is an offer to run a bed and breakfast in her<br /><br />mother's hometown, Washington, N.C. She uses this opportunity to help her<br /><br />uncle and his ailing wife and to get away from the issues confronting her<br /><br />in Atlanta. When she arrives in Washington she feels like a man-magnet,<br /><br />every one is flirting with her no matter their ages. But Monique is not interested, she is determined to stick to her resolution, that is until<br /><br />she sees contractor Russell MacDonald. But, there is a hitch, Russell is<br /><br />not the flirting kind and certainly not with Monique, he thinks she<br /><br />already gets too much attention. Monique wants to change his mind, but<br /><br />she must first change her ways.<br /><br />Bettye Griffin has written a lightly comical story with the warmth and<br /><br />sincerity of a small town. The secondary characters add just the right<br /><br />filler for the story and they compliment the lives of the hero and the<br /><br />heroine. The pull of STRAIGHT TO THE HEART beckons readers in a way I<br /><br />have come to expect from this author.

My Life	\\"Take a look in my life and see what I see.\\"  These words sung by Mary J. Blige come to mind after reading CAMILLE'S DILEMMA by DC Johnson.  Told through the lost soul of Louise, a deceased slave, Camille's story unfolds.  Her story is disturbing, emotional and comical at times.  At a young age, Camille's older sister is abducted, and as her mother grieves her missing child, Camille feels that her mother will not continue to love her, in her sister's absence.  This tragic event sends Camille into the safety and solace of her closet, where she has previously found respite from the sexual abuse from her mother's male friend.  As Camille grows into womanhood, she comes out of the closet when she comes to terms with her sexuality.<br /><br />DC Johnson weaved an interesting and emotional read.  There were instances in the novel were I was shocked and disturbed at what was taking place, and other times I laughed out loud.  I really enjoyed the novel, although it could have been better if Ms. Johnson expanded the character of Louise more to give her purpose.  There was a bit of background information given, but her connection and purpose, in relation to Camille was not clear.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-17
Who killed Aveda Douglass?	Aveda Douglass is wealthy, educated and addicted to gambling. She owes casinos millions of dollars but she has too much pride to ask her billionaire father to bail her out. Finally, she borrows the money from shady characters who stipulate that the penalty for not repaying them is death. Another of her gambling debts, from a game called \\"17\\" that she plays with her best friend Bebe, is that she have sexual relations with four different men before the year is out. She has six months to find these men and failure means she dies on New Year's Day. Unable to comply, she lies to Bebe about the number of men.<br /><br />As she finds men, has relations with them and attempts to leave them, she invokes a great deal of animosity among the men and more than one has sworn to see her dead. Aveda is also on a mission to find a husband in order to please her mother Claudette, who wants to host a large, impressive wedding. This sparks her deep involvement with the men she chooses.<br /><br />Claudette, unaware of her daughter's behavior, has enticed Aveda's former boyfriend, Frank, into proposing to her by promising him millions and a job as head coach of her husband's basketball team, the Atlanta Freedom Riders. He, too, has reason to be angry with Aveda when he finds out about her alliances with these other men, especially when one of them turns out to be his cousin.<br /><br />Aveda is also engaged in a blackmail scheme against one of her lovers, and she is spying on another to help her father realize his political ambitions. In short, Aveda Douglass is a bad girl and half the world wants to see her dead.<br /><br />ONE LUCKY WOMAN is a very interesting and captivating novel about the wealthy black folks of Atlanta, Georgia. Brantley keeps us guessing what Aveda will do next, who she will offend and who wants to kill her. We will have to wait for the next in the series to find out who did kill her. If I had one problem with the novel, it would be that some of the information provided did not move the novel forward even though it was very interesting historical and political information that helped educate. A bit less background information would have made the novel move faster.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersation provided did not move the novel forward even though it was very interesting historical and political information that helped educate.

Different but equal	WHITE GIRL: A Story of School Desegregation is a stirring and poignant<br /><br />account of the upheaval surrounding court-ordered busing in the early<br /><br />1970s. Like many students at the vanguard of this inevitable movement<br /><br />to achieve school integration, sixth-grader Clara Silverstein faced<br /><br />humiliation on a daily basis. She was spit on, tripped, and shoved by<br /><br />her new schoolmates. This was a typical reaction to the majority of<br /><br />the Black (the term of that era), children who were subject to this<br /><br />law. But this fast-paced memoir inverts our understanding of<br /><br />desegregation. Clara was white, one of the few white students in her<br /><br />entire school. This is her story, a vivid description of a<br /><br />controversial social experiment and an intimate chronicle of a young<br /><br />girl's turbulent journey through adolescence.<br /><br />Clara lived in Chicago and was very familiar with racial mixing. But<br /><br />when the family relocated to Richmond, Virginia, after the death of<br /><br />her father, her racial education escalated. She wonders how she<br /><br />lived through several agitated situations: her first crush on a Black<br /><br /> classmate, naively wearing a jacket with a Confederate flag sewn on<br /><br />to class, and surviving alone, when the other white classmates switched<br /><br />to private schools.<br /><br />Clara remained in the public schools and contends that if she learned<br /><br />nothing else, she did come to understand the scourge of racism. Her<br /><br />story is one that is usually lost in the historical accounts of busing,<br /><br />and this fact motivated her to share her experience. Her story is woven<br /><br />with in-depth historical details and several personal photographs. Some<br /><br />thirty years later there are those who question the use of the school<br /><br />system to create social change. This is a different view of this<br /><br />racially motivated issue.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers/>	2004-09-17

Despite their odd meeting they clear up all misconceptions that have kept them separated for years and rekindle the fire between them.<br /><br />Alfred Knight, in Celeste Bradley's Wedding Knight, has lived his entire life trying to avoid scandal. Little does he know he will marry directly into it when he chooses his bride to be.  She is nothing she appears to be, but everything he needs.<br /><br />Julia Hamilton, a recent widow, is now engaged to be married in three days, but a secret love has returned and intends to seduce her and make her his wife.  Leslie LaFoy's The Proposition keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering who will Julia choose.<br /><br />Not one for romance, I found myself enjoying the four tales of love, lust and deceit.

And the answer is...	Casey falls asleep while waiting for her boyfriend, John Paul, so they can celebrate an anniversary of togetherness when suddenly she is awakened. Someone is in the room with her. It is not John Paul as she had hoped, but Mali, John Paul's former girlfriend. Mali has just returned to the United States from a trip abroad and has nowhere to stay. Mali pleads with Casey to let her stay with her until she can resolve her homeless situation. Of course Casey's first thought is \\"no way\\" but she is also astute enough to know that if she doesn't agree to help her, Mali will simply go to John Paul and beg to stay in his apartment. Casey feels insecure because John Paul has cheated on her with Mali in the past. He claims it was only once but Casey doesn't want to put that temptation before either of them again.<br /><br />This book is sad and funny at the same time as Casey attempts to find out who she really is, what she will tolerate and whether or not John Paul truly loves her and is the man for her. In her search, we meet her friends. These young people occasionally switch partners, disapprove of each other's mates, throw wild parties, all in the name of searching for their future.<br /><br />It is a clever, well written novel that is entertaining and a pleasure to read. While the subject is serious, there are some scenes that will have you laughing out loud. It is a very realistic look into the lives of twenty-something people.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-17
More than the physical	BLACKFUNK III, the final reflection of Michael Pressley's Blackfunk<br /><br />trilogy, is done with much drama, but also with an affirmation of<br /><br />the endurance of the human spirit. The title boasts of the<br /><br />unprecedented escapades surrounding a very physically violent, yet<br /><br />consensual, sexually motivated phenomena. This story  captures<br /><br />the strength of a man caught between a life altering situation and<br /><br />two strong willed women.<br /><br />Attorney Rashaun Jones is on trial for the murder of his fianc&eacute;e's<br /><br />former boyfriend. Rashaun acted in self-defense, but the District<br /><br />Attorney's office is seeking a murder conviction. Rashaun is<br /><br />apprehensive, and with good reason. District Attorney Kim Rivers<br /><br />falls under the vestige of a woman scorned. She is Rahasun's<br /><br />ex-fianc&eacute;e, and two years ago he ended their engagement after<br /><br />viewing a video of her bringing 'blackfunk' to life.<br /><br />But a closer look reveals that more than revenge, Kim wants Rashaun<br /><br />back, and she will stop at nothing, not even blackmail, to get him.<br /><br />She discounts all the positives in her life: a possible appointment<br /><br />to circuit court judge and a proposal of marriage, to realize her<br /><br />obsession with him. Playing her trump card, she offers him a way out,<br /><br />which will guarantee his freedom if he agrees to her terms, but he<br /><br />stands to lose everything else. Amid a bitter lover, a murder trial<br /><br />and new temptations, Rashaun is determined to hold fast to his<br /><br />commitment to his fianc&eacute; Andria. Andria is equally determined that<br /><br />they will have their future together. To Kim's dismay, the wedding<br /><br />plans are ongoing, even though Andria and Rashaun do not plan to<br /><br />exchange vows until he is completely exonerated. Becoming battle<br /><br />weary, Rashaun is starting to take a hard look at Kim's proposal.<br /><br />Pressley has again written with a no-frills simplicity about the<br /><br />entanglements that cripple real men. Readers are made painfully aware<br /><br />of the fallout from a misguided fantasy. The author has created an<br /><br />excellent model of a strong male character and he introduces a<br /><br />plethora of secondary characters who add much drama. Reaching beyond<br /><br />all the treacherous obstacles, BLACKFUNK III climaxes Rashaun's<br /><br />journey and discovers the depth of a man who is comfortable in his<br /><br />manhood. Readers who enjoyed the preceding books will eagerly<br /><br />embrace this final performance.

Just passing through	Colin Channer's latest release, PASSING THROUGH, is not your typical novel.  Instead, it is a culmination of characters and their lineage, represented in short stories that almost take on the characteristics of journal entries. Letters from one of the major characters to the government of the island where the stories take place are also included in the book. These letters are key informational components; if I would have skipped these letters, much of the background and connecting information would have been lost to me.<br /><br />PASSING THROUGH possesses an underlying theme of heritage and also of people who come into one's life for a brief or fleeting moment, yet leave their essence behind, be it in a positive way, or in a way that scars a person for life. Channer connects everyone he introduces in the book in one way or another, whether it's by blood, love, or just passing through, as the title suggests.<br /><br />Before PASSING THROUGH, I had not read any of Channer's works, although I have heard many a reader rave about the soul that his characters embody. These claims have been substantiated and corroborated as I passed through this fabulous book.  Channer's writing is powerful, as he enlists metaphors, lyricism, and fluidity to make this reading experience a moving and intense one.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-11
When Life Gives You Lemons	Nestled in the hills of Western Virginia, Lemon City is a small black-built, black-owned, black-inhabited town that its founders established during the end of the Civil War.  There are rules in Lemon City; rules that all townsfolk must abide and live by.  The rules range from \\"Never Marry An Outsider. If You Do The Bollweevil Will Bite You Back\\" to \\"Cheating Makes You Lower Than a Dog Scratching Up A Worm In The Dirt.\\"  The citizens of this town take the rules very seriously; they have been a beacon along their path to economic and social freedom within the city limits.  But not all of the town's inhabitants are able to accept the rules without question. And, thus, the saga begins.<br /><br />Faye Dunlap and her siblings were raised by her grandparents, two of the most upstanding Lemon City citizens belonging to one of its founding families. Though Faye's bloodlines were impressive within the city limits, she was also engrained with a case of wanderlust, as she constantly wondered what the world outside of Lemon City had to offer her.  Faye attended college in another part of the state, working toward both her beautician's license and a ticket to anywhere but Lemon City.  She had big dreams of creating her own hair care products and couldn't imagine that fitting into life in Lemon City. So, she did the unspeakable and married an outsider as a way out of her hometown and into the fast-paced land of opportunity - New York City.  Plans aren't always foolproof, however, and Faye learned this lesson firsthand upon presenting her family with her new husband.<br /><br />Elaine Meryl Brown kept me in stitches while I read this fabulous tale about roots, family, and dreams.  Brown's writing flows so well that you barely notice it's there; you're too enraptured by the colorful characters and plot.  Serious at times, but for the most part light and humorous, LEMON CITY is a story that perfectly describes how to make lemonade out of the lemons life sends our way.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers/>Reviewed by CandaceK <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2004-09-11

However, Clyde Brooks calls his girls wives, and you'll never hear him calling himself a pimp. The six women prominently featured in Mary Monroe's latest novel, RED LIGHT WIVES, all fall into Clyde's profession in one way or another, be it lineage, circumstance, chance, or loyalty.<br /><br />Ester has known Clyde for much of her life. When she was a baby, Clyde found her lying in a dumpster, left for dead. Over a decade later Ester and Clyde reunite and she becomes his first wife.

Feeling the need to keep up with the Joneses, Rockelle enlists her body as her moneymaker and soon finds herself married to the moll.<br /><br />Mary Monroe staggeringly brought the four previously mentioned women, two others, and their manager, Clyde, to a luminous life. Monroe did not glamorize the profession, nor did she bash it.  Rather, she made certain that she illustrated the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a working girl.

Plus-sized Phenomena	There's a Baltimore Club song called \\"Watch Out For the Big Girl\\" that came to mind when I first glanced at the title of this book. I remember being in a dance club and loving when this song came on, as it encouraged women of all shapes and sizes to get out on the dance floor and show their stuff. L. Edwards brings to mind this same feeling in WATCH OUT FOR THE BIG GIRLS.<br /><br />In this compilation of short stories, poems, and musings, L. Edwards drives home the point that big girls have feelings, desires, and emotions, just as much as their lithe counterparts.  Edwards conveys the message throughout this little gem that full-figured women should be respected, cherished, and seen as beautiful in their own rights.<br /><br />Some of the standout entries include the linked poetic lists \\"Weight Discrimination\\" and \\"Weight Appreciation.\\" In the former the author lists the derogatory names plus-sized women endure and in the latter counters these with appreciative and much less stinging adjectives. Also included is a short story told in multiple parts, entitled \\"B&B\\", which I assumed to mean \\"Big and Beautiful.\\" The story related the experience of a full-figured woman and her dating adventures.<br /><br />L. Edwards puts it down for the big girls in a way that is not generalizing or stereotypical. Instead, the author's pieces project respect, appreciation, and courage for all of the sassy, sexy sisters known as Big Girls. I did, ironically, think the book was too skimpy and thin, and that it could have used more meat.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-11

Young Love	Dana Davidson visits the very real yet sensitive issue of teen relationships in JASON & KYRA.  The story introduces us to Jason and Kyra, two teenagers that seemingly have nothing in common.  Jason is a star basketball player, handsome, popular and smart.  Kyra, on the other hand is a free spirit, unafraid to express her individuality.  In high school however, being an individual can sometimes make you an outsider.  Kyra is extremely smart, driven, and has clear goals for her future; yet she is shunned by the popular kids.

Despite the fact that the book is over 300 pages, it is well-paced and interesting.  My only complaints about the book was that at times the dialogue seemed more like adults talking than teens and certain aspects of the plot seemed unrealistic given the age of the characters.  In spite of this, I am sure young readers will quickly find themselves engrossed in this story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
A day in the life...	How far have we really come in regards to the race issue?  No matter what strides we make, are there still lines of racial inequality?  Will we ever break the stereotypical mindsets that follow us like a bad odor?  These are some of the issues that Racey Thomas, a young, upwardly mobile, African-American woman is facing.  As she attempts to make a place for herself in corporate America, we get a peek into Racey's life as she deals with her co-workers and their pre-conceived notions regarding Blacks.  Some situations Racey found herself in were defending her education (she graduated with honors); having to explain why there is a need for Black History Month (at the same time running down a list of African-Americans who have made their mark on the world with their inventions); and being the only person of color in a upper-level meeting, where racial jokes are the norm.<br /><br />THE DIARY OF A NIGGER, NEGRO, COLORED, BLACK, AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN is an excerpt from the book of life of any person, male or female, of the African-American persuasion.  I must admit the title of this book caught my eye, promoting a desire within me to read about and become inspired by the injustices we face and one woman's attempts to change society's impression of our race.  As I read each page, the inspiration never came.  While I recognize and relate to every injustice Racey faced, this book did not stir me or move me to do more to erase, or at the very least, to blur the lines of racial inequality as I hoped it would.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Your inner voice...	I'm sure we've all experienced it...that little voice that speaks to us in certain situations, leading us or instructing us.  It's commonly referred to as our conscience, but is it really our being speaking to us, or that Higher Power who ultimately directs our steps?  How often do we listen to that voice?  How often do we wish we had followed that tug at our soul?<br /><br />Sasha Billingsley has yet to learn to \\"be still and know.\\"  She believes in the Spirit, but is not a religious person.  There are many instances where the Spirit gently coerces Sasha, but she often chooses to ignore it, which results in some drastic changes in her life.  When Sasha meets Langston Germaine, a devout Christian, the two are immediately attracted to each other, but Sasha's lack of faith is a major cause of concern for Langston.  Will Langston be able to convince Sasha to open her heart and her mind to the One who can save her?<br /><br />THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SASHA RENEE was a good debut novel.  The message behind the story was clear, but at times the plot and character development was not as strong as it could have been.  But, at the end of the story, Lewis drops a twist in that will leave the reader slack-jawed and wondering why they didn't see it coming.  I'm sure that with each of the next three \\"gospels\\", Lewis will get better at her craft, and I look forward to seeing what she comes up with next.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
A little crazy...	Claudia Barrett, a young, up and coming professional, has been engaged to Jackson Baxter for five years.  Although she claims she loves him and does want to marry him, she has been hesitant about setting the date.  After five years, Jackson finally gets fed up and calls off the engagement, much to Claudia's dismay.<br /><br />Cody, a young man who works in the same office building as Claudia, has been attracted to her since he first laid eyes on her.  When he hears that Claudia is no longer engaged, he makes known his interest in her.  Claudia is a little leery of going out with him at first, but eventually decides to take him up on his offer.  All seems well until Cody's past comes back to haunt him.<br /><br />GOING BUCK WILD...a racy title for a not so racy book.  I'm not sure what happened between the conception and final copy of this book, but the title is very misleading.  There is one part of the story where Claudia steps out of her comfort zone and becomes a little more daring, but nothing to the extent that the title and synopsis lead us to believe.  All in all, this was a good read, with enough twists and turn to keep the readers attention.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Healing for the Soul	Muchie comes from a family of healers.  Her grandmother is known throughout Wayne County, Mississippi, as a midwife who has never lost a baby.  Her father is a healer in his own right, having used his gift to cure both man and animal of their physical ailments.  Muchie sees this healing gift as both a blessing and a curse.  She is awed by her grandmother's gift and her use of various herbs, which are grown right on their own land.  She sees the positive impact that her father and grandmother have on the lives of those around her and the sacrifices they make to provide their services free of charge.  When Muchie's grandmother tells her that she also has the family gift, she is frightened.  In addition, she is reminded of the inconvenience of having to travel long distances any time of the day and night, often at a moments notice to make use of the gift to help others in the community.  In spite of this, she embraces the training her grandmother offers and continues her family legacy.  After a chain of events, Muchie denounces her gift and gives up healing altogether.  As the rest of the story unfolds, she continues to struggle with the blessing and curse of her healing hands.  In addition to the story of healing, THE LAYING ON OF HANDS is a love story.  Muchie falls in love with a man her family does not approve of, and upon graduation from high school, she must choose whether to respect her family's wishes or pursue her one true love.<br /><br />THE LAYING ON OF HANDS begins when Muchie is a young child and carries on throughout most of her adult life.  As the story unfolded I found myself drifting back to another time and place in history.  I felt, through the characters, how social issues such as racism and the color complex influenced every day life.  More importantly, the author explored true love; familial love, parental love, and the love that is shared between a husband and wife.  The writing was soothing, yet engaging.  The characters were crisp, yet multifaceted and inherently human.  The plot was satisfying in spite of the fact that the ending was a bit rushed.  The result was a story that immediately takes hold and doesn't release you until the last page is read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerstifaceted and inherently human.

Looking deep within...	AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN is the story of three people whose lives become entwined with the help of God, and a few meddlesome, but caring souls.<br /><br />Mary is a vibrant young woman who, to the dismay of her friends and family, has been stuck in a rut of misery and despair since the death of her grandmother years before.  When her friends tire of Mary's ever present \\"woe is me\\" attitude, they take it upon themselves to make over Mary in hopes that it will not only change her life, but also garner her the attentions of a man...any man.<br /><br />Puddin is a housewife with nothing but time on her hands.  When her husband begins to act a little strange, Puddin decides to give him a dose of his own medicine.  When the chicken hits the grease, what ensues is a hilarious account of a woman scorned.<br /><br />Moor is a lonely young man from South Africa.  He desires a wife, but takes no steps toward finding one.  When a couple of old cronies see through Moor's adamant stance on waiting for God to send him the woman of his dreams, they make it their mission to find Moor a wife, come hell or high water.<br /><br />Sing with me now...AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN...  This was an absolutely wonderful novel!  Sharon Ewell Foster did an amazing job of drawing me deep into this story with multi-dimensional characters and a well-developed plot, which was oftentimes humorous, but with a profound underlying message.  I especially like the fact that while this is a Christian fiction novel, the author was able to convey the message of faith, trust and love without being overly \\"preachy.\\"  This was my first novel by Foster, but it will definitely not be my last.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Catfish Q?	Using the title of CATFISH QUESADILLAS, author Brian Egeston introduces readers to a novel centering around customer service and the pitfalls that can face our society as foreigners enter the scene with the foresight of offering the same supplies and services, but with an extra bonus -- a smile and a desire to please the customer and at a cheaper price.  CATFISH QUESADILLAS  is about three small businesses which are all competing for a grant to be given to the one with the best customer service and day-to-day operations.<br /><br />As one can imagine, with a million-dollar grant at stake, out comes plans of destruction, battles to be the best, and outright unbelievable actions that at times threaten the community as a whole.  Entertaining and humorous, CATFISH QUESADILLAS brings to light the need for improvements within some of our businesses and offers suggestions on how to ensure their success.<br /><br />While this story could've actually been told in a self-help format, I love that Egeston made it fiction to allow the reader to get caught up in the story.  Egeston's  one-of-a-kind humor is ever present in this book, but more importantly, the message shines through like car beams on a dark highway.  It is after reading it that one will fully understand that if major changes aren't made within the managerial ranks of some businesses, they simply will not succeed; especially small black businesses.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Africa's literary influence	From the ancient tradition of griots to the prize winning authors of the twenty-first century, Yeni D. Ogunyemi traces the influence of the African spirit of story-telling to the many corners of the world where Africa's descendents have found themselves either as a result of slavery centuries ago or of present migration.  LITERATURES OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA is a literary journey that reaches all seven continents.  Ogunyemi sets out to prove that African descendents have had an incredible influence on world literature and that the voice of Africa can be heard on every continent in this world.<br /><br />In LITERATURES OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA, Ogunyemi dedicates a chapter to each prominent place where Black authors have flourished.  He first takes a look at the European continent focusing on such countries as Spain, Britain, and France it is here that novel takes a look at Black authors who help to shape European culture and ideology. The reader is then taken to the West Indies, Latin America, Australia, Asia and North America.  Each chapter details how the location, values and traditions of each country has helped to evolve the literature of the varied people of African decent, and in turn how these descendants have shaped the cultures and philosophies of their adopted homelands.<br /><br />LITERATURES OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA is an interesting journey across time, languages, and cultures. Ogunyemi introduces many Black authors from throughout the world.  He makes it clear that Africa has had an influence on the world for centuries.  It is through the now far away daughters and sons that the spirits of the African griots continue to live.  The book is however, often bogged down by rhetoric which causes it to be a slow and difficult read at times.  Yet, I was appreciative of the author's ambitious research.  I was also thankful to read of the many Black authors who contribute to the literary landscape of this world.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Not used to depending on anyone for anything, Adam doesn't take too kindly to Lilly, or anyone for that matter, helping him with the daily aspects of life that a sighted person performs, and often takes for granted.

What's done in the dark...	When I first glanced at the title, I said to myself here we go again.  After reading this novel, the terms down low and double life, have a whole new meaning.<br /><br />DOWN LOW, DOUBLE LIFE is centered around the lives of now married college sweethearts Jamie and Mia Kennedy and their slew of friends that bring to the fold their own set of problems.  When Mia finds her niche as a magazine editor, she finds that because of the demands of her success, she begins to spend less time with Jamie.  Although Mia has been there for Jamie through thick and thin, he has a hard time adjusting to this change and begins having thoughts of cheating on his wife.  Jamie decides to confide in his best-friend Michael, who has been divorced for two-years but still confesses to love his ex-wife.  Michael tells Jamie that being unfaithful to his wife is not a wise decision.<br /><br />Darrin Lowery Smith, writing under the penname D. L. Smith, has written a poignant novel filled with drama, drama and more drama.  Although the storyline flowed well from one chapter to the next, the novel contained an abundance of typos and grammatical errors.  I was relieved when the author candidly explained that he couldn't afford to pay an editor.  All in all, DOWN LOW, DOUBLE LIFE was an enjoyable read.  This was my first novel by the very talented D.

Mr. Fraser's primary goal is to establish a \\"New Underground Railroad\\" of sorts, which basically would not only work for the  success of an individual, but also for the Black population.<br /><br />This book is a compilation of facts, personal stories and tips on improving life for all of us. A sense of community and caring is something that is missing in the world today, and the author hopes to make us more aware of that fact. While I found SUCCESS RUNS IN OUR RACE to be a very informative book,it is not a novel, it is more in the vein of a textbook.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

When she meets big time director Jackson Larimore at a conference, she gives him a copy of her script.  After reading the script, Jackson is so impressed that he immediately starts the production process, believing that it will be the next big blockbuster.<br /><br />Simi is unable to believe that all of her years of struggling are soon to be over, but what is also shocking is the intensity of the attraction between her & Jackson.  After only days of knowing each other, the couple believes they have finally found their soul mate.  Declaring their love for each other, Simi & Jackson engage in a beautiful love affair.  Will their relationship stand the test of time, or will the evil lurking about be too much for the couple to endure?<br /><br />IF LOVING YOU IS WRONG was an average read.  There was plenty of love, passion, and even a little bit of mystery and intrigue, but unfortunately it was not enough to hold my attention.  I wish the author would have played up the mystery and intrigue portion of the storyline more than she did.  It would have definitely made for a more enjoyable read.  Normally I am a fan of Bussey's, but this particular novel left something to be desired.

Raven, who has an agenda of her own that doesn't include Derek or falling in love with him again, will make Derek realize that things aren't always as they seem.<br /><br />CODE NAME: DIVA was an action-packed, funny, light-hearted read with an unlikely heroine.

Complex Look at Manhood	SATAN'S ANVIL is a unique collection of short stories that are entertaining, thought provoking, and chock full of social commentary.  While I enjoyed some stories more than others, each explored the lives and inner-workings of starkly different men and covered a myriad of experiences.<br /><br />Notable stories include the title story, which covered the lives of former band mates that are now approaching their twilight years.  A series of events force them to reminisce about their respective pasts, which turn out to be full of lies, deceit and betrayal.  What they eventually uncover is that their lives have overlapped in more ways than they would prefer or even imagine.  The resulting emotions lead to a dramatic and explosive ending.  In Slick's Lick we are presented with a former Black Panther who became a part of the organization for all the wrong reasons.  After leaving the Panthers he decides to attend college so that he can ultimately develop and execute his own brand of nation building.  Years later he is forced to ask himself if his current life is a reflection of the lofty goals he had in the past.  Finally in two connected stories, Willie's Dice and Falling Off the Wing, we follow Willie Cooper as he develops and executes what he considers a no lose scheme for some fast money.  But is money all that matters in life?<br /><br />This is an eclectic mix of stories that provide fresh new perspectives on what it is to be an African-American man.  I thoroughly enjoyed how the author set up scenarios that forced the characters into deep soul searching and self-reflection.  My only fault with the collection is that some of the stories left me hanging.  I would love to see some of them, particularly Willie Cooper's story further developed into full-length novels.  Obi's writing style is more cerebral than many of his contemporary counterparts and his work is a pleasant deviation from the norm.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersewers <br /> <br />	2004-09-07
A twenty-first century perspective on The Souls of Black Fol	William Edward Burghardt Du Bois is perhaps one of the most influential African-Americans in history. Before there was a Martin Luther King, Jr. or Malcolm X, Du Bois was a voice and conscience of a people. An intellectual, scholar and activist, Du Bois' fight for equality spanned from the era of Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Movement. His philosophy and insight into the plight of African-Americans still reigns true and valuable today. In SAVING THE RACE: CONVERSATIONS ON DU BOIS FROM A COLLECTIVE MEMOIR OF SOULS author Rebecca Carroll gathers eighteen well-known and influential African-Americans such as: Julian Bond, A'Leila Bundles, Lalita Tademy, Toure, and Jewell Jackson McCabe to discuss their perspective on Du Bois and his most famous and studied work The Souls of Black Folk.<br /><br />In candid essays, each of the eighteen people, whose accomplishments range from writer to politicians, discuss their thoughts on Du Bois's work, ideology and accomplishments. They revisit issues raised in The Souls of Black Folk such as race, classism, injustices and hope. Each person reveals how the concerns raised by Du Bois nearly a century ago are still relevant today to African-Americans as a community and within their own personal lives. Rebecca Carroll also peppers the book with her personal struggles of coming to terms with being Black in America, for she was a bi-racial child raised by a White family in rural New Hampshire. At times isolated and unsure of her identity, Du Bois was one of Carroll's  first and most influential personal testament to the trials and tribulations of African-Americans.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the testimony by the many well known African-Americans. Looking at The Souls of Black Folks from a modern perspective was refreshing and inspiring. The essays were revealing and thought provoking. Although the old adage \\"The more things change the more they stay the same,\\" reigns true in many instances, the accomplishments, hope, dignity and pride that African-Americans have managed to hang on to  in the face of enormous obstacles is nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

She suffers through countless chemotherapy and radiation treatments, pain and loss, but yet she persevered.<br /><br />CANCER! THE DAY TIME STOOD STILL: AN AMERICAN WITH AFRICAN DESCENT BROWN EYES VIEW is an amazing story of a brave woman who wanted to share her story with the world, so she could help others. While the book is very informative and inspirational, the writing often ventures in too many different directions and offers too much detail. I felt that the author could have given general overviews in some situations and would have still gotten her point across. I applaud Ms. Greene for her courage to share her story with others and I pray that she continues to stay in good health.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Learning about One Man's Dream	Walter Dean Myers has created a good introduction to the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his book I'VE SEEN THE PROMISED LAND.  Through the story, children are presented with his basic biographical information beginning with his birth in 1929 and ending with his assassination in 1968.  In addition, children are briefly introduced to the Civil Rights Movement, Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Myers also shares some of the highlights of Dr. King's work in the movement and some of the personal sacrifices he made to do the work.<br /><br />Overall, this book serves as a pleasant introduction to the life of Dr. King.  The illustrations were enjoyable and really enhance the story.  My biggest criticism is that it seems to define the Civil Rights Movement as a whole and Dr. King's life as synonymous.  While Dr. King did have a major impact on the Civil Rights Movement, it was much bigger than King alone and included countless other heroes and sheroes throughout the nation.  This book is by no means comprehensive, but as an introduction the author doesn't do a bad job presenting the information in a way that very young (his target audience) children will be able to grasp.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07

Dancing to a different beat	DANCER'S PARADISE:  An Erotic Journey a novel by Debrena Allen as told by Terry B. was a very interesting book.  Readers are given a glimpse into the lives of dancer's Debrena Allen and Lorrie Cunningham and photographer Choice Fowler.  They each are faced with various issues while coming to terms with their sexuality.<br /><br />Debrena and Lorrie have known each other since meeting at a dance audition when Debrena was ten years old.  Years later they are now dancers with the Dominique St. Claire Dance Studio in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  After ending a relationship with her live-in female partner, and as a means of her inability to accept her gay lifestyle, Debrena starts dating Choice.  Although, Debrena and Choice have a normal man-woman relationship, she knows in her heart that she is truly in love with Lorrie.<br /><br />Debrena Allen is derived from over one hundred interviews with women who acknowledge themselves as being bisexual or gay.  I admire the Debrena Allen's of this world for sharing their stories of coming to terms with their sexuality and I commend Terry B. for recognizing them as the author.  This was a truly amazing novel and the storyline flowed from one chapter to the next without missing a beat.  I am anxiously awaiting Choice Fowler's story At Midnight the follow-up to DANCER'S PARADISE:  An Erotic Journey.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pamela Bolden<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07

Will their road to happiness be all hearts, flowers and perfection as Faythe has wished for so long?<br /><br />Told in first person, FROM FAYTHE TO EVER-INCREASING FAITH was a good debut novel.

Motherhood	Charisse A. Carney-Nunes has written a beautiful book of poems that celebrates motherhood from the African-American woman's perspective. Inspired by the author's very own trials and tribulations as a mother, SONGS OF A SISTERMOM: MOTHERHOOD POEMS is presented in four sections. The first section, Prelude to the Dance, expresses the love that a man and woman experience from courtship to marriage. The beautifully written \\"Eternal Love Song\\" and \\"A Mother's Love Letter\\" are the highlights of the section. Hymns of Preparation, the second section, is an ode to the blessing of being with child. \\"The Child You'll Be\\", a mother speaking lovingly to her unborn child, and \\"Don't Question a Blessing\\", are heartfelt and endearing. Section three, From B Flat to F Sharp, are poems discussing the joys and challenges of raising an African-American child. I was especially touched by \\"Nappy\\" a mother relating to her daughter regarding the pain and beauty of having nappy hair. The poem \\"Leroy's Song\\" is a lyrical plea to mothers to stand by and stand up for their sons. The Ninth Symphony, the fourth and final section, culminates the wisdom of life's lessons. Pieces entitled \\"Asante\\" and \\"Motherhood Movement\\" revealed the hope that all mothers have for their children and the world in which they must raise them in.<br /><br />SONGS OF A SISTERMOM: MOTHERHOOD POEMS is a celebration of motherhood from the perspective of an African-American woman, one that is rarely displayed in prose. The poems were well written and presented; they ranged from joyful to heartbreaking but at all times remained hopeful. Many of the pieces were so lyrically written that I heard them as lullabies being whispered into a child's ear. Charisse A. Carney-Nunes has presented the experience of motherhood in all its glory with wonderful results.<br /><br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Temptation...	What do you get when you have a lonely, neglected wife and a young, virile man?  A recipe for disaster, or a hot and steamy affair that leads to promises of forever?  Do  you give in to the temptation or do you stand firm on your marriage vows, and do whatever you can to regain the attention of your husband?<br /><br />This is the dilemma Portia Warfield, a thirty-eight year old teacher, is facing.  Never in her many years of teaching has thoughts of getting involved with any of her students crossed her mind.  That is until Jonny Quest walks into her life.  From the first day Jonny walks into her class, she is very attracted to him, and vice versa, but Portia refuses to compromise her job.  Years later, she runs into Jonny again, and although the stigma of teacher/student relationships is no longer there, the attraction is.  Portia fights the attraction as long as possible, but when her workaholic husband begins to be out of town more than he is at home, the loneliness is more than she can bear.  After a while, things start to get a little sticky in Portia and Jonny's secret rendezvous, so she decides to pull back.  But is it too late?  Has she bitten off more than she can chew?<br /><br />THE CRADLEROBBERS: CLASS ACT was an average read.  The premise of the story was good, with twists and turns that are the makings of a good novel.  I would have like to see the story go into a little more detail, though.  There were also several grammatical errors that detracted from the story a bit.  I do feel that with a little more work, T. C. Matthews has the potential to be a great writer, and I look forward to her future works.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Southern Blues	MISSISSIPPI BLUES is a story about avoidance.  Beverly Lamark has run away from her issues with her siblings in Mississippi by cutting off communication with them, her marital problems by drowning them in alcohol, and her true dreams as a writer by masking her identity and writing novels that will make her a lot of money but never make her happy.  On what seems like a typical day she gets a call from one of her sisters telling her that she and her siblings must make a decision about some land their father left them upon his death several years ago.  Suddenly Beverly is forced to travel home to Mississippi, a trip she has long been avoiding.  As she and her children take the road trip together, Beverly realizes how little her children know about her family and her hometown and pledges to share more about her past.  The last time she was home she didn't leave on the best of terms and is dreading the confrontation that is sure to come.  Later, a tragic event that forces Beverly to stop running.  She realizes that she and her siblings have to deal with their issues and she must face the fact that her marriage has been unhappy for a long time.<br /><br />Cassandra Darden Bell has penned a novel that truly captures the essence of family drama.  The story takes place over the course of a relatively short period of time, yet the plot was satisfying and the characters were well developed.  The fact that so many of the issues between the characters were due to misconceptions, miscommunication and the masking of hurt feelings gave the plot a sense of realism that made the story an unforgettable one.  There is no drama like family drama, but the love between siblings is a force to be reckoned with.  The ultimate lesson in this book is that in spite of it all, families stick together.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07

Murder in Historical New Orleans	It's the summer of 1833 and the muddy, cobbledstone streets of New Orleans reek with the stench of death. The city is under siege by an invisible killer that is claiming hundreds of lives. Knowing no difference between class or color, yellow fever is striking at will. From the lavish mansions of the wealthy landowners to the battered slave quarters, no one is safe. Nothing seems to be able to keep the illness at bay, not the skills of the conventional doctors or the mysterious healing powers of the voodoos. Citizens fortunate enough to get away to the country flee in droves. The ones left behind avoid the streets and open markets as much as possible, leaving New Orleans a virtual ghost town by night fall.<br /><br />The city's hospital is filled beyond capacity with the wailing, suffering victims of the fever. For Benjamin January this is one of the rare occasions where he can use his skills in medicine. Educated in the finest medical schools in France, January is an accomplished, experienced surgeon. However, in 1833 New Orleans no Black man can practice medicine, even if they are free. Therefore, January is subjected to being nothing more than an assistant to less competent white doctors. Yet, as a trained physician he can not ignore the suffering of others. So by night, enduring meager wages and indignities, he assists the suffering victims as best as he can, sometimes secretly correcting the wrongs his less skilled white counterparts bestow upon them.<br /><br />By day January earns his living as a music teacher, one of the few dignified jobs available to a free man of color. He teaches the children from wealthy white families as well as a few from the free black families how to read music and play piano. It is during one of these lessons that January is approached by a runaway slave to relay a message to the servant of one of his pupils. Having been a slave himself, January understands the desire to hear and see loved ones who have been sold away, so he takes the risk to pass on the message. Little does he know that this one act of kindness will have deadly consequences.<br /><br />Intrigued and angered by the events that transpires, January decides to investigate. What he uncovers is a string of mysterious disappearances masked by the yellow fever epidemic. Understanding that it is not safe or accessible for a Black man to question what goes on behind certain closed doors, January approaches everything and everyone with extreme caution. He knows that he must rely upon his wit and a few trustworthy friends to get to the truth. As he digs deeper into the mystery, risking life and limb, he uncovers a den of lies, deceptions and a sadistic, murderous secret that will shock and anger even the most hardened New Orleans citizen.<br /><br />In FEVER SEASON, Barbara Hambly has captured the essence of old New Orleans.<br /><br />Hambly brings to life the complex mixture of cultures and people that helped form New Orleans into such a legendary city. Never relinquishing to mere stereotypes, Benjamin January is a character who understands his environment and those who inhabit it. Hambly allows him to remain dignified and intelligent in a world that often did not appreciate such attributes in a Black man. January was first introduced in A Free Man of Color, and although FEVER SEASON continues with his experiences in New Orleans,  it truly is a stand alone novel. So for anyone who wants an intelligent mystery where the characters are believable and the plot is thrilling, pull up a bowl of gumbo and take a stroll down the French Quarter in FEVER SEASON.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

When the perfect opportunity arrives to restore the diamond to its rightful owner, Kemba jumps at the chance.  When a tragic turn of events take place during the heist, Kemba seeks help, and it comes in the form of the handsome, and single, Pastor Eric Avery.<br /><br />At first, Eric is not quite sure that he believes Kemba's story, but as time progresses, his feelings change.  He also finds himself undeniably attracted to her and wants nothing more than to develop a relationship with Kemba.  Due to the fact that Eric is a minister, Kemba is a little hesitant about forming a relationship with him.  Will Eric be able to convince Kemba that her fears are unfounded, or will she step out on faith and embrace the love of a good man that God saw fit to bless her with?<br /><br />Full of mystery, murder, intrigue, suspense, and of course romance, TREASURES OF THE HEART was a truly wonderful read.  Jacquelin Thomas never fails to deliver!  Her stories are beautifully written, complete with characters who quickly become favorites of her loyal fan base.  Although this was Thomas' last romance novel, I will still be a loyal follower of her as she forays deeper into the genre of Christian fiction novels.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Love and faith conquers all	People struggle everyday to stay in good health, because without your health everything else in life seems to take a backseat. Therefore, we battle to lose weight, we try to stop smoking, we try to stop drinking, and we strive to eat better and exercise more. To lose your health is not only devastating to mind, body, and soul it affects how you interact with the world and the people you love. Most people want to be able to live long, vibrant lives so that they can enjoy their children, grandchildren, and all the good things that life has to offer. No one wants to become a burden to others. What happens to those unfortunate enough to be given devastating diagnoses? How does one cope with the realization that every breath taken could very well be the last? How does one pull himself together to rely upon faith and love to pull him through?<br /><br />In TO HELL AND BACK THREE TIMES: THE CANCER EXPERIENCE, author Tony Williams not only had to confront the issues raised above, but he had to do so at a tender age. The last thing a child ever considers is dying, especially of such a devastating disease as cancer. However, Tony Williams and his family were unexpectedly faced with the concept of death when he was grimly diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin's Lymphoma at the tender age of fifteen. Growing up with a single mother on welfare who worked two jobs and had to care for three children, Tony was carved out as normal of a childhood as possible. His mother could not give her children much in the way of material things but she did give them a foundation of unconditional love and faith. It was  this love and faith that Tony relied upon to combat cancer. The extraordinary part of Tony's story is that he was not only stricken with cancer once, but three times and lived to tell about it.<br /><br />TO HELL AND BACK THREE TIMES: THE CANCER EXPERIENCE tells of a young man's unwavering hope and will to live. Never questioning God or his faith, Tony's positive attitude is nothing short of amazing. In this short memoir he offers hope and comfort to others with cancer. He gives information on places to contact for treatment and support. He also includes an extensive glossary on the terminology that one should become familiar with when facing cancer. Uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time, this memoir is one that will last with the reader long after the last page. I only wish that the author would have produced a memoir that wasn't as clinical as this one was; one that didn't seem so much like an extensive pamphlet from the oncologist. Nearly a third of the book is dedicated to a glossary. However, I believe that anyone who comes across this story will nevertheless be encouraged.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

For the love of money.	Taking his cue from the harsh realities of the streets, author Mark Anthony has brought to life an incredible work of fiction that brings to the forefront the horrors of fast living and ill begotten money. In 1991 when the drug epidemic was at an all time high, many Americans, from all walks of life, found themselves in some way touched by the ever reaching evils that accompanied the use and selling of illicit drugs. However, no one seemed to be as hard hit by the trafficking, distribution and use of drugs, and the violence it spewed, than the youth of America's inner cities. Hordes of young men and women were ruined and corrupted by the fleeting power and money that drugs brought to the streets. The Fourth Crew of Queens, New York was such a group. Young, talented and intelligent, they were a group of African-American men who were seduced then betrayed by the false promises of street-life.<br /><br />The Fourth Crew started out as a group of neighborhood friends whose bond was as strong as that of blood brothers. By no means innocent, they were however, just a group of friends who enjoyed life and were there for one another when the ills of Queens would rear its ugly head. Things changed for these young men in the summer of 1991. Fed up with being second class to the guys on the streets with money and girls, the Fourth Crew decided to become drug kingpins. Once and for all they were determined to get the things they wanted in life: money, street-credibility and women. In order to achieve such ambitious goals, the once seemingly harmless members of the Fourth Crew would have to transform themselves into hardened criminals. Soon the tight-knit group would find themselves torn apart by murder, prison and betrayal.<br /><br />Told through the eyes of young Mark Holsey, the Fourth Crew member with a heart of gold, PAPER CHASERS is a page-turner that captivates from the first page. Mark Anthony takes you on a journey that is exciting and heartbreaking. Although street-life has been a popular theme in contemporary fiction, Mark Anthony's novel stands out from the rest. PAPER CHASERS is action-packed, sleek and intelligent. The novel delivers a true message about the ills of life on the streets, without being preachy or judgmental. The characters were non-stereotypical and believable.  I found myself riveted and saddened by what eventually became of some of the characters.

Chicago's forgotten moneymakers.	When discussing the history of Chicago, several things instantly come to mind.  First, there's the incredible legacy of Chicago's overzealous, long-winded, power-struggling politicians from which the nickname \\"Windy City\\" derived.  There's the glorious history of Chicago's world-renowned sport teams, and infamous gangsters and law enforcement, leaving the names of such notables as Al Capone and Elliot Ness forever associated with the city. Yet, the history of Chicago seems incomplete. A city with one of the largest African-American populations in the United States, there seems to be little to no history detailing the legacy of this group. Nathan Thompson has heeded the call and has written a detailed account of how Chicago's historical South-Side was developed and run by African-Americans, due in part to the policy kings and local number racketeers.<br /><br />Thompson's extensive research brings to life how the game of policy, similar to the modern day lottery, was developed by African-Americans in the South and brought to Chicago during the great southern migration. Within a short time African-Americans from all walks of life were playing the numbers. Monies generated by the gambling catapulted key policy backers into some of the first African-American tycoons of the city. In turn, many of these policy kings reinvested in their communities creating economic independence and institutions still instrumental in Chicago's African-American community today. Yet, all was not rosy and peaceful, for large sums of illegally begotten money in the hands of the African-American policy kings did not go unnoticed by crooked politicians, policemen and notorious gangsters.<br /><br />Nathan Thompson should be congratulated on his comprehensive research on the development and destruction of the policy game. Thompson has helped fill a gap in Chicago's history, for the African-American can no longer be conveniently left out when discussing the development of the city. The book is also a remarkable testament to the inventive, entrepreneurial spirit of the African-American, at a time when all other doors to economic prosperity were closed. Without Thompson's research, who would have known that the county's Lottery system was invented and perfected by an African-American.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Back into Bondage.	Benjamin January has solved his share of mysteries. It has always been difficult for him to turn away anyone in need.  As a Black man in 1830s New Orleans January understands all too well the concept of injustice. However, the man who has recently come to him for help is the last person in the entire world he wants to help. The man who needs January's assistance this time is none other than his heartless former owner, Simon Fourchet.  Although it has been decades since he was in bondage, January can neither forget nor forgive the man who used, abused and treated him and his family like animals. Fourchet is growing older and even more bitter. The last thing he wants to do is ask for help from his former property. Yet, January is the only person he can trust to go undercover and find the culprit who is hell bent on destroying him.<br /><br />Reluctant to help Fourchet, January must reconsider for the sake of all those still in bondage on Fourchet's plantation. Fourchet and others believe that the arson, sabotage and murders are being done by the hands of a slave. January knows that if he doesn't help find the killer every slave will suffer. And plantation justice is the most brutal of all. In order to save innocents, January will have to leave his comfortable life and return to the slave quarters on the plantation Mon Triumphe, and discover the deadly secrets that reside there as well as in the \\"Big House\\".<br /><br />SOLD DOWN THE RIVER by Barbara Hambly is another superb outing for the heroic Benjamin January. Hambly brings to life the sights, smells, and indignities of the Louisiana plantations. She paints a glorious picture of a cast of characters who all have secrets and hidden agendas. Hambly does not write her characters in just black and white. All of the characters are three dimensional. Although the issue of slavery is still a sore spot for this country, Hambly tackles it with intelligence, reality and sensitivity.

The business of incorporating...	Anyone trying to incorporate their business knows it's a tedious process with lots of research necessary.  INCORPORATE NOW! has taken everything one needs to know and rolled it into one book detailing how to go about things with examples to help in the process.  Author Daniel Sitarz includes brief summaries of the various types of corporations, legal forms, checklists, and other tools to quickly assess what's involved with incorporation.<br /><br />A plus to the book is that in addition to all of the above items, it includes a CD-ROM of the actual forms that you can print off or fill in on the screen.  Additionally, the author has included information for incorporating in the continental United States with fees associated with each state, mailing addresses, and a wealth of information specific to that state.<br /><br />While I did find this book informational and a great tool, I've already done a lot of research on the various types of incorporations so I had some understanding of the terms.  Someone brand new to the language of incorporation would probably need something a bit more detailed that goes more in depth and offers pros and cons to each option.  That person could then fully utilize this wonderful resource for the small business entrepreneur.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Unafraid to Fight	Alexis DeVeaux presents a comprehensive account of self-described feminist, lesbian, and poet warrior, Audre Lorde.  The author pulls together a myriad of published documents, unpublished journal entries by Audre Lorde herself, and a host of interviews with personal friends and family members to create a well documented look at the poet's life.  The book is divided into two major sections called \\"lives.\\"  The first life begins prior to Audre's birth, and highlights some aspects of her parent's early life, their eventual marriage and move from the Caribbean to the United States.  This family background helps readers understand Audre's nearly lifelong quest to come to terms with her relationship with her often emotionally detached parents.  This portion of the book also details information about Audre's childhood, educational background, and young adult life.  We learn about Audre's marriage to a white, gay, man and their eventual divorce and follow her process of \\"coming out\\" regarding her own lesbianism.  Her long-term relationship with a white woman, Frances Clayton, and the challenges associated with raising a bi-racial son and daughter in a lesbian household during an era of rampant, overt racism and sexism was also discussed.  DeVeaux also takes time to highlight some of Audre Lorde's flaws, thus providing a somewhat more balanced view of the author.  Her professional career as a poet develops slowly, and the evolution of her writing career parallels the evolution of her political views and personal growth.<br /><br />The second section of the book, \\"The Second Life,\\" continues to explore her career development, chronicles her battles with cancer in more detail, and ends with her death. Audre Lorde supported freedom and equality for all, regardless of race, gender, class, or sexual orientation.  However, because of her strong views and personal lifestyle, she often found herself on the fringes.  Many white feminists were uncomfortable with her views on race, while those involved in the black power movement tended to be uncomfortable with her feminist ideology and her lesbianism.  Yet she used her own struggles, particularly her battle with cancer, as a means to educate, motivate, and inspire.<br /><br />I enjoyed WARRIOR POET and was impressed by Alexis DeVeaux's attention to detail and the time she spent helping readers understand the social and political climate of the times.  There were times when I felt she went a little too far \\"setting the stage\\" and wanted to read more about Audre and less about other poets, or politics.  Audre seemed to use her identity to take on very public battles for women's rights, gay rights, and so forth.  But I found myself wanting to know more about how her children handled their mother's public persona.  I also wondered how her very conservative, Catholic mother and her other siblings responded to Audre's lifestyle, and this issue was surprisingly never addressed.  In spite of its sometimes academic feel, this is a must read for anyone that wants to learn more about an important literary figure.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswhile those involved in the black power movement tended to be uncomfortable with her feminist ideology and her lesbianism.

Family History	How well do you know your family's history?  Are there any rare genetic disorders that seem to plague family members, no matter the generation?  Whether your answer is yes or no, I invite you to take a glimpse into the lives of Creola Pittman Colon and her family, a family haunted by the mysterious deaths of almost every male in their family.<br /><br />For decades, the Pittman's believed their family was under a curse that would claim the lives of nearly every one of their baby boys.  No matter what they did, using old home remedies passed down from generation to generation, or seeking the pitiful excuse for medical care that was available to poor Black families in the mid-1900's, the babies still died.  Their deaths were not quick and merciful, instead they were almost always long, drawn out, and painful.<br /><br />Tired of attending funerals and not knowing what was claiming the lives of her brothers, nephews, and two of her sons, Creola takes it upon herself to find out all she can about the \\"cuhs\\" that her family can't seem to shake.  She's met with roadblock after roadblock, not only from doctors who couldn't explain the mystery, but also from family members who believed it best to not try to unearth any secrets that could shed light on the situation.  Will this family ever discover what has claimed the lives of their children, or are they doomed to a life of utter despair and hopelessness?<br /><br />BORN WITH A BROKEN HEART was a very detailed account of the lives of Creola Colon and her family, and the tragedy that has afflicted them for many years.  It was heartbreaking to read about the suffering and eventual painful deaths of the babies.  While I did enjoy this book, it was often repetitive, and could have been written in fewer pages than it's 591 without detracting from the story at all.  I do however, commend the author for sharing her family's tragedies with the world, and endeavoring to find out all she can about the disorder, so that the necessary precautions can be taken in order to spare the lives of future members of her family.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersssary precautions can be taken in order to spare the lives of future members of her family. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Renee Williams <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br />	2004-09-07

As the blooming relationship between Vincent and Camille develops, a tragic incident from their past is about to unfold.

Recording History Through Pictures	W. E. B. DuBois says in the opening page, A SMALL NATION OF PEOPLE<br /><br />is \\"an honest, straightforward exhibit of a small nation of people,<br /><br />picturing their life and development without apology or gloss, and<br /><br />above all made by themselves...\\"  This book displays<br /><br />portraits of African-Americans in a way that shows the progress made<br /><br />in the 20th century, and they dispel the negative connotations we've<br /><br />grown accustomed to seeing in the media, in the newspapers and even<br /><br />in the history books of today.<br /><br />Once part of the Paris Exhibition, these pictures speak volumes<br /><br />individually and collectively and show a special type of pride, a<br /><br />certain strength that isn't displayed in commercial venues such as<br /><br />movies.  It was wonderful seeing all types of buildings, landscapes<br /><br />ranging from Georgia to Washington D.C. and also seeing businessmen,<br /><br />such as Warren C. Coleman, the owner of the only Negro-owned cotton<br /><br />mill in the United States at the time the picture was taken.<br /><br />With essays by David Levering Lewis & Deborah Willis, centered<br /><br />around the beautiful portraits of a culture, A SMALL NATION OF<br /><br />PEOPLE, is a must-have for every African-American or those interested<br /><br />in the diversity of our race.  From the hairstyles, to the clothing,<br /><br />to the actual hue of the skin, this book talks to you and shares the<br /><br />pride of a people determined to make it despite having recently come<br /><br />out of slavery.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Interactive Inspiration	Our book?  When I first read the title to this book, I immediately wondered what the author had in mind when he developed the title.  After reading the introduction, it was clear that Abe Thompson created a book that would motivate me to reflect on my own life and the choices I make.  He candidly shares some of his experiences and uses them as a backdrop to discuss larger issues.  His discussion on success and failure was particularly poignant.  He shares that one of his lifelong dreams was to own a radio station in a major market such as New York.  When the opportunity to own a station in Kalamazoo, Michigan came up he initially considered it failure, but then seized the opportunity as a way to expand his already successful professional accomplishments.  He then raises the question if you don't end up exactly where you plan in life how do you handle it?  Do you pass it up and keep looking for something bigger, sulk and moan and consider it a loss, or do you seize the opportunity and make it work to your advantage?  I can't answer these questions for you, but with Thompson's guidance and introspection you can answer them for yourself.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS, YOUR JOURNAL, OUR BOOK is a unique offering that is a deeply personal read.  Abe Thompson offers his views on a variety of topics ranging from parenting, friendliness, and the power of a positive attitude. What makes this book unique is the format, which is highly interactive.  Thompson begins by stating that the book is intended to be written in, and the discussion questions followed by the blank lined pages at the end of each chapter are a testament to that fact.  By reading the author's inspirational words, taking some time to reflect on the passages, and then answering the discussion questions, readers are sure to find a deeper insight, just as I did.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Singing the Blues	ESCAPING THE DELTA: ROBERT JOHNSON AND THE INVENTION OF THE BLUES by Elijah Wald is perhaps the most comprehensive biography celebrating the life and times of the famed Blues legend. Unlike many biographers, Elijah Wald doesn't just spew out a mundane chronological biography of Johnson. Instead, Wald weaves an entertaining and heartfelt look at the history of a truly unique African-American art form and Johnson's place within it. Separating fact from fiction, Wald educates and dazzles the reader regarding the man whom legend says sold his soul to the devil at a crossroad for fame, the ability to play a mean guitar, and to sing the Blues like no other.<br /><br />From the beginning Wald recreates the musical landscape which Johnson embraced and perfected. The author introduces the reader to the art form that is itself the Blues. Wald tackles the truth of the Blues origins and the romantic misconception of the early Blues musicians as poor backwards wailers who sang songs of the downtrodden, and of the tragic existence that many Blacks lived at the turn of the century. Wald makes it clear that the Blues was primarily regarded as  popular Black music and its most successful crooners were professional musicians who drove nice cars, wore fine clothes, and were every bit as popular with their audience as today's pop stars are with theirs.<br /><br />Robert Johnson makes a great figure to study because he is the only Blues artist whose recordings were pre-World War and survive to this day. Robert Johnson serves as the only bridge between modern listeners and how Blues was originally sung and expressed in the Delta. Robert Johnson is also unique in the sense that his entire repertoire of recordings still exist. Every song set to vinyl by Johnson can still be purchased today. Johnson also brings sensationalism and romanticism to the history of Blues. Legends abound about the man who is said to have been a womanizer, devil worshiper and who died a horribly tragic, and untimely death leave behind a glimpse into a time and a genre that continues to shape music, musicians, and listeners to this day.<br /><br />Elijah Wald does a wonderful job of bringing to life for the reader the dirt roads and cotton fields of the South and the culture from which Robert Johnson was sprung. The recounting of the \\"good ol' days\\" of the Blues from those who sang and plucked it from their guitars was a joy to read. The respect that Elijah Wald gave to his subject was truly that from a person who is a fan of music and appreciates the historical significance of Robert Johnson and the invention of the Blues. Even if you have never heard a Blues song before, or  not a fan of the genre, ESCAPING THE DELTA: ROBERT JOHNSON AND THE INVENTION OF THE BLUES is an absorbing read into an African-American art form and the musicians who played it from the heart.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Voodoo on trial	It's the summer of 1834 and New Orleaneans are basking in the festivities of the season. All seems well for Benjamin January this summer. He has steady employment as a musician and as a music teacher for some of the city's wealthiest residents. Although racially oppressed January has begun to resettle into the traditions and culture of New Orleans since returning from France.<br /><br />Yet things do not remain calm for January for long this steamy summer. Olympe, January's rebellious sister, is arrested for the murder of a prominent citizen. Not only is Olympe's life in jeopardy because in 1834 there is absolutely no justice for a Black woman in a court of law, but Olympe is also a known voodoo practitioner. Association with voodoo automatically makes her guilty in the eyes of New Orleans' residents, especially to the all white jury of men who will be presiding over her trial.<br /><br />Confident of his sister's innocence and fearful for her life, January sets out to expose the truth. As he delves deeper into the mystery, his own life becomes endangered. He becomes the target of a voodoo curse. Armed with wit, along with the help of a few friends and the famed voodoo queen Madame Marie Laveau, January sets out to save his sister and catch a killer.<br /><br />GRAVEYARD DUST has all the chills and thrills of Barbara Hambly's first two novels involving Benjamin January. Hambly tackles the controversial topic of voodoo in New Orleans with intelligence. She leaves behind all the stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the religion. Once again, Hambly has crafted another stand-alone mystery for the Benjamin January series. Her descriptions of New Orleans, its people and places will leave you breathless, and the night scenes in graveyards and at voodoo rituals will cause you to look over your shoulder as you stroll along with January.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Murder, deception, and betrayal	Though I'm an avid reader, it isn't often that I will pick up the same book more than once.  I convince myself that it's pointless to do so since I already know what's going to happen.  In spite of this, PRETENSES kept calling me to take a second look and I was just as excited reading it the second time as I was the first time almost two years ago -- before it was even published.  There is no doubt in my mind that Keith Lee Johnson's writing will capture even the pickiest reader as he takes one on a literary joy-ride with FBI Special Agent Phoenix Perry and her nemesis Coco Nimbura, a ruthless assassin who gives \\"pleasure in death\\" a new meaning when taking out her targets.<br /><br />When a black Supreme Court nominee and her husband are killed in their homes, the President of the United States personally assigns Phoenix to the high-profile case as a way of retaliating against the killer.  All the while, Coco is one step ahead of the FBI and killing without abandon.  Once she finds out that Phoenix is a worthy adversary, she touches as closely as possible to Phoenix's life.  Coco is convinced that Phoenix is the one person who can grant her her final wish before she goes out of the business.  As the case and the killings continue, Phoenix finds out that Coco is more like her than she cares to admit.<br /><br />PRETENSES is a novel that demands to be on the big screen.  Keith Lee Johnson has worked his magic in this wonderfully written suspense thriller.  PRETENSES is packed with multi-layered and suspenseful plots that will have readers thirsty for more. The title states it all, as raw truths are revealed through murder, deception, and betrayal.  This is a must read that I'd recommend (and read over) time and time again.<br /><br />Date Reviewed: June 28, 2004<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A Healthier Look At Weight Loss	You can't turn on the television without seeing a commercial for one. You can't read a magazine without coming across an ad for one. Everyone knows at least one person who has tried several in a lifetime. You may be that very person. What is the secret word? The word is...Diet! Americans, specifically women, are obsessed with winning the battle of the bulge. Women are bombarded by societal images that tell us if we don't fit into a perfect size six (or less), we are not beautiful, smart, desirable, successful or lovable. We, therefore, spend billions a year on diet aides, foods, supplements, exercise equipment and gym memberships. Yet, we are more overweight than ever before. The average American woman wears a size sixteen. Why do we continue to fail in the pursuit of weight lost? Dr. Deidre Little, a certified clinical nutritionist, attempts to answer that question in FIT FOR ETERNITY: BALANCED LIVING THROUGH BETTER NUTRITION AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH.<br /><br />According to Dr. Little, before we can properly nourish the body we must first nourish the soul. Many people are overweight and suffer from eating disorders because of a lack of emotional and spiritual balance. Weight loss should be the result, not the goal of a well-balanced life, states Dr. Little. She shows by her own life's examples, and those of several patients, how you can leave the diet madness behind, and maintain a healthier lifestyle by embracing God and self first. FIT FOR ETERNITY: BALANCED LIVING THROUGH BETTER NUTRITION AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH goes beyond the mundane nutritional guide, by providing motivational scripture and prayer throughout. At the closing of each chapter, you are provided a \\"Fit Tip\\", a tip to help motivate and put you on the path to spiritual and physical renewal.<br /><br />I was pleased at how much information was packed into 160 pages. Dr. Little included everything from proper exercise goals to safe and effective meal planning. I found a little of myself in every client discussed, I therefore, became encouraged by their success. FIT FOR ETERNITY: BALANCED LIVING THROUGH BETTER NUTRITION AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH  is a must have for any woman fed up with the diet craze, but still on that road to proper weight loss.

A diet for us...	As women, a lot of us are always worried about our weight and losing a pound or two here and there.  In a lot of cases, we try fad diets, pills, and even go to our doctors for advice and counseling on how to lose weight.  However, THE BLACK DIET DOCTOR'S SOLUTION FOR BLACK WOMEN informs us that not every physician is capable of truly treating black women when it comes to weight loss.  They give an example of weight being like hair and that though we're all born with a certain type, that type is what determines which beauty salon we go into.  It makes perfect sense right?<br /><br />Well, actually it does and authors Robert S. Beale, Jr and Lisa M. Beale do an exemplary job of breaking down the causes of obesity in black women and what can be done to avoid it, fix it, and get back on the track of living healthy lives.  Through their program of \\"eating to lose\\" and then \\"eating to maintain\\" they have created various programs based upon your current weight to help you lose weight. They also teach how to set milestones, incorporate your lifestyle in the program, and add recipes and exercises to assist with the weight loss.<br /><br />The style of writing was my favorite part of the book. I didn't spend major time in dietary mumbo-jumbo trying to figure out what X or Y meant.  Everything was written in a manner in which I could easily relate and understand and make it one that I would recommend to others.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to taking the next step -- actually following one of the programs for myself to truly test out their theory.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Another memorable character!	Earl Sewell has a knack for creating memorable characters and scenes in his novels that stay with the reader long after they've read the last page.  In Taken for Granted (TFG) he gave us his most memorable character, Rubylee, and also the infamous ski jet sex scene.  Well, fans of Sewell have no reason to fret.  He's created yet another character whom readers will love to hate, while introducing even more original love scenes that are sure to heat up things.  I know I'll never look at a dental chair the same again.  Throw all that around a storyline celebrating and challenging the sanctity of marriage, and you're left with another wonderful read that not only entertains, but educates.<br /><br />THROUGH THICK AND THIN, the sequel to TFG, brings back Richard and Nina; happily married and getting through the issues of their past.  They're living a lovey-dovey day-to-day adventure:  great sex, communication, and appreciation for one another.  Richard has become quite successful and with the help of Nina has started his own dental clinic and spa.  With the intention of incorporating a special theme in which patients would love to visit the dentist, they embark on a partnership, both in business and in marriage that shows the beauty of true love.<br /><br />Of course, when things seem to be perfect, there has to be something or someone thrown into the mix to snap things back into perspective.  That's where Dr. Charlene Hayward steps into the scene.  Beautiful, smart, and as vindictive as they come, Charlene is all about Charlene and doing whatever she has to do to get what she wants, personally and professionally.  After her involvement with a wealthy politician goes askew, she almost destroys her status as a dentist and isn't sure where to turn to find a job.  A bell goes off and she decides to go to Richard for a job; remembering her past involvement with him', she's sure she can finagle her way into a partnership and possibly his bed.  Can Richard's marriage and business stand up to the emergence of Charlene or will she end up on top as she usually does?<br /><br />THROUGH THICK AND THIN was an exciting, fast-paced read, which I read in one sitting.  While the relationship with Nina and Richard was sickeningly sweet at times, I loved that Sewell balanced the book out with Charlene.  She is one bad woman...a character that readers will definitely add to the list of those they love to hate.

The Team	Athletes and sexual violence are dominating the headlines, and now it's being presented to us in the storyline of author Dawson Perkins' debut release, THE TEAM.  In spite of the fact that it's all over the media and it does indeed happen, too much attention seems to be focused on the glamour of it, the lifestyle of the rapist and not enough attention is directed to the victim.  How does she feel?  How will she get through it?  Can she put it behind her and continue life?  Is there indeed justice?  These are some of the questions that Perkins digs a little deeper to bring up in THE TEAM.<br /><br />Gwen Fagen appears to have it all together.  She's a career-driven professional at the top of her game working as an accountant in a firm in Atlanta.  She's good at her job and those around her help celebrate her success and accomplishments as she moves up the corporate ladder.  On the flip side, her personal life is non-existent and she's content with not being involved with anyone on that level.  She has the perfect facade and with the exception of her friend Payton, who doles out pychologist-driven feedback and dialogue in their weekly conversations, no one knows about her past or how she was raped in college by a basketball superstar.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Gwen, the facade starts to crack when Xavier Dean joins her firm and is assigned to work with her on a case.  She is immediately thrown back into her past, as Xavier is the best friend of the guy who raped her and part of \\"The Team,\\" the name given to the group of basketball stars who dominated the courts and her college campus.  The biggest problem that she finds with Xavier is that everyone likes him, he is actually a \\"good guy\\" in spite of what she wants to believe.  Yet, her distrust of men and the memories of her rape do their best to pull her away from him, despite the attraction.  Eventually, things take a turn and she allows him into her life, but still refuses to share with him the full details of her past and who she is and how she knew him.

Only As Beautiful As Our Thoughts	Praises to Denise Crittendon for GIRL IN THE MIRROR! With only 72 pages, this little book packs a wealth of information for girls of any race. It is hard enough just being a teenager, growing up in these chaotic times when it seems the cards are stacked against them. GIRL IN THE MIRROR knocks down this wall, and gives teenage girls a fighting chance against the worst enemy imaginable, themselves.<br /><br />Chapter One, \\"You Thought Yourself Into It-You Can Think Yourself Out Of It,\\" teaches how the mind is a powerful tool, and our thoughts whether positive or negative, create our own reality. This is a recurring theme throughout the book, offering activities in creative visualization, self love, affirmations, and the power of forgiveness. Crittendon teaches the importance of keeping a personal relationship with God as well, but does it in a way that is neither preachy nor judgmental. She encourages teenagers to speak with God in a manner comfortable to them, whether singing, rapping, whispering or just being quiet; because He is always listening. It is important to realize also, when problems arise and life seems crazy God is still there, He is just trying to get your attention. Problems are merely opportunities to do something different.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a personal quote from a popular actor, sports figure or musician to which any teenager can relate. Additionally, at the end of each chapter several exercises are listed to further implement the lessons of self awareness. In fact, my own daughters, ages 15 and 11, have read this book and truly enjoyed it. It was not too complicated, the lessons were simple and straightforward, and the exercises really made them look inside themselves and think.<br /><br />I believe having a strong self love and self awareness can provide a weapon against the pitfalls plaguing so many teenage girls today, such as drugs, promiscuity, and pregnancy. All of our girls are precious diamonds who just need a little help to shine, and GIRL IN THE MIRROR is just what the doctor ordered.le help to shine, and GIRL IN THE MIRROR is just what the doctor ordered. <br /> <br />	2004-09-07
Love is where the heart is	Poetry is perhaps one of the most difficult literary art forms to master because the poet must convey a multitude of ideals and emotions in a succinct format. Poetry evokes all the human emotions from humor to heartache. In THE LOOKING HEART: A COLLECTION OF POETRY AND EXPRESSIONS FROM THE HEART, author Marc Lacy focuses on love specifically. He tackles all that love entails: the good, the bad, and the ugly. He discusses love in all its forms, from that of a child to a mother, to that of one lover to the other. Lacy impressively expresses his homage to love in nearly every poetic format by using traditional prose, free verse and odes to display his thoughts.<br /><br />Standout chapters in this book of verse are those entitled \\"Odes From The Heart\\" and \\"Love And Feelings As Seen By The Heart\\". The odes pay homage to various famous and infamous individuals from history who inpired and awed us. I was particularly impressed by the odes to Zora N. Hurston, Princess Diana and Tupac. The chapter \\"Love And Feelings As Seen By The Heart\\" is an eclectic collection that expresses from different viewpoints how love brings both pain and happiness to one's life.<br /><br />THE LOOKING HEART: A COLLECTION OF POETRY AND EXPRESSIONS FROM THE HEART was an interesting although somewhat daunting read with more than one hundred poems to experience. As with any collection, there are hits and misses within this volume. Some of the chapters could have been scaled down and others seemed awkwardly out of place like the chapter dedicated to the weather. Perhaps with a bit more editing and more discerning selections of poems this could have been a great book of prose instead of just a good one.  (3.5 Rating)<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

Out of The Ashes	It has been said each of us has a twin soul somewhere on this earth. In  MIRRORED LIVES, Jan and Lib are such twin souls. These two women are from very different backgrounds, but fate will have its hand in bringing them together through the manipulation and deceit of one man. Jan and Lib form a friendship like no other; and through this bond are able to put their parallel lives into writing, serving as empowerment for other women with similar circumstances.<br /><br />Lib, a black southern rural girl, searches for love and security, but believes she is nothing more than mediocre. She falls hard for the young and charismatic Sidney. The two marry soon after college graduation, but it becomes evident the honeymoon was short-lived. It will take many years of infidelity, abuse and neglect from Sidney before Lib finds the courage to leave her \\"secure\\" marriage.<br /><br />Jan, a white northern farm girl, grows up seeking adventure and risk, much like her spirited young days; but to her dismay she soon realizes her life has become predictable and unfulfilling. She leaves her 24 year marriage to find peace of mind, but instead finds Sidney, a smooth brother indeed. Has Jan finally found her soulmate? After a short time being married to Sidney, Jan also finds out that everything that glitters is not gold.<br /><br />Jan and Lib form an unusual alliance with one another, more out of necessity and survival than anything else. I was intrigued by the women's relationship, void of the usual drama associated with ex's. The poem entitled \\"After A While\\" deeply touched me and should be required reading for all of our daughters.  The transition between each story flows quite well, making it a smooth read; yet the numerous quotes in the beginning of each chapter should be limited to only one or two. Also, I wanted to read more of Lib's point of view, she seemed like a woman with so much more to say than what was presented.<br /><br />MIRRORED LIVES is more than a testament to the strength and courage of these two, it is also a source of encouragement for all women to hold on, have faith, believe in yourself, and know that true love is found within.to the strength and courage of these two, it is also a source of encouragement for all women to hold on, have faith, believe in yourself, and know that true love is found within. <br /> <br />	2004-09-07
Cutthroat...	Despite the overwhelming odds he faced growing up on the streets of New York, Gregory McGregor went on to become college graduate, and to secure an internship with a highly prestigious firm as an investment banker.  Little does he know, he was only hired to fill a \\"color quotient.\\"  Even though he works hard to prove himself, he is still not respected as he should be.  When he is promoted to manager, his situation gets worse instead of better.  Will Gregory discover the secrets of the company, and if so, will he take steps to correct them, no matter what the cost?<br /><br />When I read the synopsis of AGAINST A BRICK WALL, I expected high drama from the very first page to the last.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Instead, it was a long, rambling story of one man's attempt to make his mark in corporate America, and the injustices he faced.  The action doesn't happen until the very end of the book, which left me very unfulfilled.  It did not end as I hoped it would.  I do, however, feel that with a little less attention to scene detail, and more attention focused on developing a gripping plot, Garrett has the ability to become a good mystery writer.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07

When people start to die, and his family is threatened, Blades' suspicions are not unfounded.When an important politician is killed, the victims' family looks to Blades for help. He is then thrown back into the dangerous world he thought that he'd left behind.<br /><br />LOVE AND DEATH IN BROOKLYN by Glenville Lovell is a heart stopping action thriller that kept me guessing. With the themes of friendship, lust and the need for revenge, this is an exhilarating novel. I love fast paced crime novels with a hero for who I can root and Blades Overstreet, who serves up a hefty dose of drama and sex appeal is quickly becoming my favorite mystery man. For excitement and adventure with a sexy backdrop, I recommend that you invest in a copy of this book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
It's all about trust...	Can't get enough Soul Food?  Does the long hiatus between seasons leave you frustrated and fiending for more?  Well fiend no more!  You can now get your Soul Food \\"fix\\" from SOUL FOOD: FOR BETTER, FOR WORSE, the very first novel adapted from the hit television series.<br /><br />Desiring to prove to his wife, her family, and himself that he is more than an ex-con, Lem secretly starts taking a class to learn how to start his own business.  When an opportunity to illegally obtain the cash he needs presents itself, will Lem stand firm in his resolve to remain crime free?  Or will the temptation be too strong to resist?<br /><br />Bird, Lem's wife, doesn't know what to think of Lem's weekly disappearing acts.

I found myself totally enraptured with the storyline and the depth of the emotions so vividly portrayed.

In The Fast Lane	Eric Jerome Dickey continues to write about real, emotional characters. The main character who goes by the name Driver, is a chauffer to the rich and famous, and he can only dream of living the life of those who pass through the doors of his Lincoln Town Car. Since he can never live their lives, he settles for living vicariously through them. As much as he sometimes resents his job, there is one advantage; he is often privy to secrets that could cause scandels if they are made known. Driver is a proud man with a past, a past that makes him respect the secrecy his clients need and makes him walk the straight and narrow. His life has taken on a comfortable existence until his deranged ex-mistress and former partner in crime, calls in some markers.<br /><br />Recently out of prison, pretty women and fast cars are the vehicles that Driver uses to get by, but he is not satisfied with just getting by. He has always wanted to live comfortably, but, being an ex-con and making money honestly don't always go hand in hand. When his back is against the wall, financially and emotionally, he turns back to his old ways, and must come face to face with the consequences of his actions. Along the way Driver becomes involved with some loveable but crooked characters.<br /><br />DRIVE ME CRAZY is a novel that left my head spinning and my heart pounding. Murder, drama, intrigue, and a dash of romance are ingredients that make this story top notch. Eric Jerome Dickey has written ten novels and with each one his writing gets stronger. DRIVE ME CRAZY is a great marriage of street life and the best things that life can offer. The characters are gritty, conniving, and even though some of them are living the high life they are empty people. Reading this story was a joy and I can't wait for Mr. Dickey's next release.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Melodic Whispers...	In reading poetry, one must sometimes read poems out loud to get the full affect of them.  However sometimes they are so powerful that the words resonate off the pages.  MUTED WHISPERS is a bit of both.  ZaKiYa quietly whispers words that later have an affect on the reader once they are fully observed, while in other poems, it's almost as if she's screaming and shouting her love, joy, disconcertment or anger.<br /><br />ZaKiYa has separated this book into seven sections: truth, tranquility, erotic, fear, love, freestyle, and spirit.  Through each section she has shown her innermost feelings, both the negative and the positive and encourages the reader to free themselves.  While I enjoyed almost all the poems in this collection, I really found great comfort in the tranquility section.  I really loved how the author shows both her strengths and weaknesses throughout each poem and I look forward to the day I can actually hear her live and in person in a spoken word forum.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Platinum Records	Some people want money, some want power, all Mimi wants to do is sing. Singing is her passion and she has always wanted to be a star. When she gets the opportunity to audition for Lamont Jackson, the CEO of Triple Large Entertainment, she prays that all of her dreams will come true. She signs with Lamont as the label's premiere female singer and she can barely contain her excitement. Unfortunately all that glitters is not gold, and Mimi finds that accomplishing her goals is hard work.<br /><br />With new clothes,\\"a phat apartment,\\" and a happening social life, Mimi is well on the road to stardom. Triple Large, a hip hop label is a cross between P Diddy's Bad Boy Entertainment and Damon Dash's Rockafella Records. Triple Large is about image, so when they decide to promote a singer everything must be perfect. The look, the act, and the visibility. At first Mimi is enchanted and excited with her new found fame and lifestyle, but when she realizes that the music industry can sometimes be a backstabbing and tumultuous business she questions whether the hard times are worth the pain.<br /><br />BLING, by Erica Kennedy, is a wonderful debut novel. It gives readers an inside track into the music industry and what it takes to be a star. Entertainers often make everything look easy and Mimi's character was a great example of someone who realized that to get what you want you have to earn it. There was never a dull moment in this story, and at times I found myself laughing hysterically or crying with concern. Ms. Kennedy is a talented author who writes strong, distinct and memorable characters. I highly recommend this book to others, and would one day like to see it as a movie.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
The seedy world of politics	The world of politics can be glamorous, sexy, seedy and in the novel TANTRUM, dangerous. \\"The Councilman\\" is a young, vibrant, motivated and intelligent Philadelphia politician. Many of the politician's constituents seem to believe that he is a Godsend. He seems to be just what the voters of Philadelphia needs. He is shaking up the political structure and giving his fellow elected officials a dose of reality. Many believe that the young political leader has what it takes to move up the ladder in Philly and beyond. So if \\"The Councilman\\" is the greatest thing since sliced bread, why is he the target of an assassin's bullet? Is it a disgruntled citizen out for the politician, a jealous member of the city's political structure, a mob hit or something much more sinister from the councilman's past? What deadly secrets does he hold? Philadelphia soon learns that all that glitters isn't gold, and just as quickly as someone rises to grace they can easily fall from it.<br /><br />TANTRUM by Charles D. Ellison, is a roller-coaster ride of a novel. The pace is fast and the action is vivid. The hosts of characters that Ellison presents in the novel are intriguing. Ellison creates many narratives that all come together in the novel's climax. This political thriller is for anyone who wants a jolt with their reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by L.

All About The Moon...	In our lives we come through many crossroards that determine who we become in the future.  Maurice Dupree is returning from college and has also received a scholarship for law school--a wonderful opportunity which he could only dream about.  Unfortunately, he has a few things holding him back and/or determining his thoughts on how she should proceed with his life.  There is his girlfriend Omenita who is tired of the small town they grew up in and tired of waiting on him to marry her and take her away from her oppressive life.  She basically tells him that the time is up for school and he needs to be a husband to her and get a job and take her away from her misery.  On the other side of the spectrum is his loving mother who is proud that her son is the first in their family to attend college and has a chance to make a career as a lawyer.  Yet, she doesn't afford him the space to make his own decision regarding the things in his life.  There is a definite problem when neither likes the other and Maurice must again make a choice between two things very dear to him.<br /><br />The interactions between mother and son and potential wife and son were engaging and interesting. Additionally, Maurice's father and grandfather both offer him pearls of wisdom regarding life, becoming a man, love and marriage.  They are the strength of the book, what gave it its allure.  The reader is also given a peek inside the lives of the family in which Maurice's mom provides housekeeping service.  It is through the daughter of the family, Danielle, that Maurice is afforded the strength to make a necessary decision as the story unfolds.<br /><br />With strong character development and characters that you'll either love or hate, I thought this was going to be one of those \\"can't put down\\" books, but instead, I found myself getting tired just from reading the dialogue.  I'm one that admittantly hates repetition, but it seems the characters continually repeated everything.  I'm sure it was intentional to make a point, but this took away something from the book as it made it predictable and a bit tedious to keep reading the same thing over and over again. What really made this book memorable for me was the love the grandfather had for his deceased wife.  It was a perfect example of what love and marriage should be able.<br /><br />This is my first Ernest Hill book and while I do plan to eventually read the other(s), I'm not sure that this was a good introduction for me.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Living Isn't Easy	PROBLEMS IN LIVING tells the story of Lana and Eve, two sisters who have struggled throughout their lives to remove the shackles of their past.  The story is a family drama with a hefty sprinkling of relationship issues all of which stem from a past that is shrouded in secrecy and half truths.  Lana has always played the role of protector and problem solver in the family.  She is married but finds it difficult to let go of her control issues and trust that her husband will truly be their for her. Her brother Curtis is the black sheep of the family; he has had long standing addiction issues and as a result he is rather irresponsible. He is married and regularly abuses his wife in front of their small children.  Eve is the fragile one in the family; she is often crippled by anxiety, depression, and other bizarre behavior.  Lana's father is perfect in her eyes, yet her relationship with her mother is strained at best.  Her mother's strange attitudes about women and life in general have left all three children scarred emotionally.  In spite of all the family issues and the fact that the parents are divorced, the entire family gathers each week for a family dinner which often results in major drama.  When the book opens, Eve is pregnant and anxious to learn the sex of her baby.  Her pregnancy seems to initiate a chain of events that shakes Lana and the entire family to the very core.  Lana discovers that nothing is as she thought it was and the very people she thought she was holding together had been protecting her as well.<br /><br />The premise of the book was excellent, my only complaint was that there were periods where the story dragged and then the ending was rushed.  The character development was good for the most part, but I would have liked to have learned a little more about Eve's inner thoughts.  The diverse group of characters and the various subplots added additional depth to the story line.  Overall, PROBLEMS IN LIVING is an enjoyable read that has high drama without being over the top.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersgh drama without being over the top. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers <br /> <br />	2004-09-07

He and his partner/best friend Vernon Brown have been promoted twice in as many years.

F.B.I agent Cheryl Chase is deep undercover impersonating the girlfriend of a drug lord with ties to several police departments. Chase is in fear of her life and she needs Joe, the only person she trusts, to help her get out alive. Joe knows that to get her out means going undercover himself. The case is an extremely dangerous one and a mere slip will certainly cost Joe and Chase their lives. If he takes the assignment he will have to infiltrate a ring of dirty cops with a psychopathic ring leader. Will Joe put his life and family at risk to save Agent Chase? If the assigment is taken will Joe be cunning enough to outwit a psychotic criminal and get Agent Chase and himself out alive?<br /><br />BLACK RAIN by Vincent R. Alexandria is a thriller that doesn't fail to deliver the thrills. Joe Johnson is a great character in the tradition of police dramas. BLACK RAIN also has one of the most sadistic villains ever, one that readers will love to hate. I enjoyed the quick pace and non-stop action that peppered the novel.

Celebrating heritage	BEAUTY, HER BASKET is a beautifully drawn story of a young girl's visit with her grandmother and the story of her African heritage and how to weave a sea grass basket.  Using acrylics for the full-color art, Cozbi A. Cobrera has done an exceptional job of bring this book to life.<br /><br />In the story, a young girl (never named) shares the landscape and beauty of the stories shared with her grandmother and cousin Victor.  The plot centers around basketry and its African origins as well as other skills such as fishing and rice farming which slaves brought to America from Africa.<br /><br />Though I loved the lessons taught in the story and how it teaches children to appreciate their ancestry and the beauty around them, I simply didn't \\"get\\" the title  of the book, even after reading it three times.  Because of this, I couldn't totally enjoy it and spent a lot of time trying to figure out if Beauty, Her Basket was the name of the basket since the others mentioned in the book were also called the same thing.  Perhaps, it's in a native patios/dialect that I just didn't understand?  I'm not sure, but I think children will have a problem understanding the correlation between the title, basket, and the story, but in spite of that, will be delighted with the art work.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

From Friends to Lovers	What better person to fall in love with than your best friend?  Someone who has been with you through the ups and downs of life, someone who knows you better than you know yourself.  Someone who loves and shares unconditionally, puts up with your flaws, celebrates your good points, and even goes so far as to have your back even when they may not agree with your choices.  Do best friends make the best lovers, partners, or spouses, or is this a line you're better off not crossing?  Denene Millner and Nick Chiles are back this summer with their latest novel, A LOVE STORY, which details the lives of best friends Aaron and Nina, who after more than two decades have decided to cross the line, surpassing the \\"just friends\\" boundary.<br /><br />Aaron is a struggling photographer/bartender who was raised to be the perfect gentleman.  Nina has a good job, is outspoken, beautiful and knows what she wants out of life, and isn't afraid to go after it.  Forming an unbreakable bond during childhood, their friendship was one similar to the scenes that unfolded in the popular movie Love and Basketball.  A LOVE STORY travels through their childhood, on to the present time, and then back through various points in their lives.  As different as night and day, yet held together by an unmistakable bond, you can't help but to want to see them together as a couple.<br /><br />Using their trademark \\"he say/she say\\" style, Denene Millner & Nick Chiles have written A LOVE STORY from alternating male and female points of view, allowing the reader a glimpse into the actual thoughts and emotions of both protagonists.  In addition to this, they've added a myriad of flashbacks helping us get to know both Aaron and Nina individually, then as friends, and finally, as a couple.<br /><br />While the flashbacks do a commendable job of giving us the history of the characters, they just weren't appealing to me.  Instead, it was a bit distracting.  I found myself rushing through a scene to get back to the present time in hopes of finding out what would happen.  I really wanted to know if what we've grown to believe over the years would work for the characters:  that falling in love and being in a relationship are better when you're friends first.<br /><br />Perhaps the book would've been more enjoyable had the story been told in chronological order, but I'm afraid had it been done that way, it really would've seemed like a replica of the aforementioned movie.  In spite of this, I did love the dialogue, the humor, the friendship between the characters, and also the twists that jumped up unexpectedly throughout the book.  I mostly enjoyed seeing both sides of the story and knowing how each character felt about various issues.  Millner and Chiles did an admirable job of peeking under the surface of love and relationships; especially as it pertains to those who are friends first.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Consequences and repercussions...	Sex.  Lies.  Drama.  Sound like the makings of a Jerry Springer show?  Not this time.  Instead, it's the basis for Darren Coleman's latest release, BEFORE I LET GO.<br /><br />Cory Dandridge is an up and coming young professional with an MBA, but when it comes to the lessons of love, he is decidedly lacking.  When his girlfriend dumps him, he embarks on a roller coaster ride of love interests that even the sanest of persons would avoid like the bubonic plague.<br /><br />Nathan McCall, or Nate as he is better known, is the ultimate playboy.  His mission in life is to bed as many women as possible.  It won't be long before Nate comes to the realization that he has played his games one too many times.<br /><br />Brendan Shue is supposedly the levelheaded, nice one of the group, but his doggish tendencies surface when he finds himself juggling three women at the same time.  It's not a pretty scene either, when Brendan's schemes come to a head with each of the women.<br /><br />If you're a fan of hardcore sex and high drama, then you are sure to enjoy BEFORE I LET GO.  There were times when the author managed to keep my eyes glued to the pages, wondering how certain situations would be resolved.  But, the more I read, because of the exhausting and excessive amounts of drama, I was just ready for the book to end.

It has been years since readers were left wondering what happened with Regina and Parker,  but SAY YES is definitely worth the wait.  This was a dynamic novel that eloquently depicts the three most important factors in any relationship - faith, love and trust.

Love that Transcends Time and Space	FLESH AND THE DEVIL is a love story, yet so much more.  Kola Boof takes readers on a journey that begins with the creation of the world and continues thousands of years ultimately bringing us to the present.  As the author takes readers on this journey, she presents a special love, a \\"Black Love,\\" that transcends generations.  Through this exploration of love, the author demonstrates that love knows no boundaries, and that even in death, true love never dies.  Through the course of the story, the author explores many other social issues including the treatment of women and the psychological impact of slavery, the color complex, and motherhood.<br /><br />The lyrical prose and thoughtful dialogue really bring the story to life and give it an almost folktale feel.  Her captivating words drew me into the story and truly transported me to different times and places.  The characters were alive and vibrant; I felt what they were feeling, gleaned many important messages, and learned quite a bit from their experiences.  In this story, archetypes are given a spirit, or rather a soul, and truly come to life.  For example, in some literature, a character who is a slave is presented as a flat uni-dimensional character.  In FLESH AND THE DEVIL the author moves beyond the archetypal slave, slave trader, or modern African-American character and provides depth, and substance through her multi-faceted characters.<br /><br />The only part of the story that I disliked were the moments where the author opted to preach her message versus letting the characters demonstrate it through their stories.  The moments when the characters would lapse into monologues about various issues took away from the story primarily because it came across as preachy and was unnecessary because the author did an excellent job relaying those messages through the characters and plot.  FLESH AND THE DEVIL is a unique book that takes you off the beaten path of today's literary offerings, it will make you think and more importantly, touch the deepest recesses of your heart.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthink and more importantly, touch the deepest recesses of your heart. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay  <br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Life in the hood	For whatever reason Maceo Redfield has never felt comfortable with his life, and as a result he has always lived his life on the run. Sometimes running from individuals, however most times running from his own personal demons. Oakland, California is his birthplace and his heart will always be there, but when things become too complicated, his way out is to do what most cowards do, he runs.<br /><br />Oakland is but a memory until his childhood friend, basketball superstar Cornelius \\"Cotton\\" Knox is accused of murder. Maceo feels the pull of loyalty drawing him back to the place he thought he'd left behind. When Maceo disappeared two years ago, for those who loved him, he left behind a world of hurt and disappointment. He seizes the opportunity to save Cotton, as it is also a way to redeem himself.<br /><br />Seedy hotels, shady characters, and prostitutes are familiar things that Maceo encounters, but it is a path he must retrace to find the answers to all of his questions. But there is something positive in all of his efforts, he meets a  mysterious and intriguing woman who ignites feelings in him that he thought were long dead, and he must not let this interfere with his quest.<br /><br />THE LAST KING is an urban drama that takes readers into the dark side of Oakland, yet Ms. Tramble does not lose them in the darkness. She places much emphasis on the fact that your environment is only one factor when determining where your life will take you. And she shows that with supreme dedication, strong friendships can weather any storm. The writing is strong, visual and real and at times  I felt the pain and confusion of the characters. This story touched me and I highly recommend it to others.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07
Legacy	Ashley has a very important school assignment.  She has to write a report about an organization that does good things in the community and her mother suggests she write about her sorority, Delta Sigma Theta.  After researching the sorority, Ashley is amazed by all of the public service programs the organization is involved in.  She proudly shares all that she has learned about the history of the Delta's and their involvement in the community.  Later she learns that her teacher is also a Delta.  She decides that when she gets older and attends college she will also become a member of this notable sisterhood.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful tool that parents can use to introduce their children to Delta Sigma Theta.  At times I felt that there was too much emphasis on the history of the organization in the context of the story, however, members of the sorority will probably enjoy this feature of the book.  While this book may not be considered a \\"must have\\" for every child's library, it is well-suited for the niche of Delta Sigma Theta members that happen to be mothers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-09-07

How Do I Love Thee Let Me Count The Ways	STREET DIVA, a collection of 125 poems, is all about love and its diverse forms.  Ms. Character writes about the all encompassing spiritual love of God, the abiding support from the love of family and the embracing romantic love of a mate.  She writes with such eloquence about the love of God that the collection borders on inspirational.  Often while reading her work I thought about how God has blessed me with his love, along with the love of family and friends, and I realized, with great reverence, what it meant to be divinely favored.<br /><br />Ms. Character's poem Peace expresses the point in ones life when they find peace with their existence and how liberating it feels.  The poem titled Love touches on what a loving relationship feels like and the things one does while in love.  These two poems moved me because I have found peace with myself, and it does feel wonderful to be in love.<br /><br />The title STREET DIVA may be a little misleading. If you are looking for gritty street tales you will not find them here.  However, if your desire is a celebration of love and how it wraps itself around you and makes you whole, I recommend you acquire a copy of STREET DIVA.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-08-17
Daddy's Girl	SHIFTING THROUGH NEUTRAL is a coming of age novel about a young girl's passage into womanhood.  Growing up in a dysfunctional family, little Rae Dodson attempts to keep the peace between her severely depressed mother and dangerously hypertensive father, while trying to find her way.  As life often is, Rae's journey is a bittersweet one.<br /><br />SHIFTING THROUGH NEUTRAL is a very realistic depiction of families that have fallen apart, yet remain together.  The complex interpersonal relationships between family members are explored, such as the father-daughter and husband-wife dynamic.  The language used to portray the story adds to its realism.  I liked the backdrop of cars and driving with sections of the book corresponding with Rae's life titled Idling, and Accelerating, which was fitting since the story is set in Detroit, the Motor City.<br /><br />This melancholy story is long and drawn out at times and loses it's momentum at parts.  The novel did not grab my full attention all the way through.  It is a good quality story, yet a slow paced read.  I enjoyed reading the story about this fictional Detroit family.  If you want to be taken back in time, at a leisurely pace to a time forgotten, you will enjoy SHIFTING THROUGH NEUTRAL.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewers	2004-08-16

They come to him because he has the ability to investigate freely in areas where the police are enemy number one.<br /><br />Easy Rawlins is determined to find the true killer, because he understands, all too well, how the Police Department will disregard the life of a Black woman.  Since Easy is in the business of doing favors, he calls on the homicidal Mouse and the intelligent, but cowardly Jackson Blue to help in the investigation.  With these two colorful characters, Easy finds himself in uncomfortable situations, but they come through for him every time.<br /><br />I was so engrossed in the story it was over before I knew it.  It captured my attention from beginning to end.  I was excited at the climax of the novel and felt a rush of adrenaline when Easy believes he has solved the crime.

Teaching about environment	The GIGGLE WIND, written by Carol Andrews, is an entertaining as well as educational story all parents should definitely share with their children.  It covers the importance of the environment and what we can do to protect it in our day-to-day actions.<br /><br />Elizabeth lives near the beach and finds herself out in her Sunday clothes exploring the area around her house when she falls and dirties her clothes.  She adjusts her hair and then wonders why she didn't bruise herself when she fell.  It is then that she hears a soft giggle in the wind and is immediately drawn to the sound.  She's unable to find the source of the giggling, so she heads home to get cleaned up before her mother can see her.<br /><br />After being duly reprimanded by her mother, Elizabeth tells her family of the sounds she heard and her mother immediately recalls the story of The Giggle Wind.  After dinner, they head back out to the beach in hopes of hearing the sound again.  It is then that Elizabeth's mother shares the story with her, telling her about lichens and their environmental benefit to the world.  She also shares the importance of not polluting or destroying the area.  In the midst of her story, the mother lichen is listening closely and when Elizabeth's mother finishes her story, she shares the beautiful sound of the giggle wind with her and Elizabeth.<br /><br />This story was absolutely delightful!  Not only is it educational, but it was heartwarming to see Elizabeth's mother share such an important part of how to be responsible.  Coupled with the beautiful artwork of Steven M. Cozart, this is a book that I look forward to recommending to other parents.  The illustrations are done in a sepia type tone that is remarkable.  Though not as vivid as color would make it, the technique used by the author is breathtaking from the distinctive features of the characters, to their surroundings.  It truly brought this story to life.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZReviewersThe RAWSISTAZReviewers <br />  <br />	2004-08-14

Newsome has written an interesting book in the Christian genre that surpasses many of its kind in that it spares us the long sermons, the finger pointing and preaching.

We meet and actually get to know Trey, Vince, and their girl Erika as they make sense of their lives and find the true answer to the balance of life.<br /><br />Trey is a successful attorney who handles high profile divorce cases; he is also egotistical, arrogant, intelligent and sexy as all get out.  Six years ago he was in love with the beautiful Layla, but when she revealed a shocking secret, Trey changes completely.  The man he was no longer exists, and we ride the roller coaster with him and his sexual exploits that are too hot to mention in this review.  However, when his life spirals out of control and he loses all that is important to him, he must find the true Trey within by learning to balance all aspects of his life.<br /><br />Vince is a true renaissance man; he is a motivational speaker, author and artist.  He is successful on all levels of his life, except relationships, but he is in search of the perfect mate.  The reader follows his search only to realize his ideal mate isn't going to be perfect.  Vince must learn to look beyond the obvious and find real love because surprisingly, she is closer than he thinks and more familiar than he realizes.<br /><br />Erika has found success in the medical field.  She loves her boys, Trey and Vince and they love her as only true friends can.  Not only is her professional life on track, she has found the ideal man, the most romantic, caring and unselfish man she has ever met, but he does have a flaw and it lies in the bedroom.  Trying to make sense of the sexual problem, Erika turns to an old flame to feel womanly.  In the end, she must choose what is most important and apply the concept of balancing the principles of personal, professional and self.<br /><br />These three friends share so much of their lives with one another.

It is going to take a lot of soul searching to mend the tattered hearts of these three friends.  They can mend if all three apply the principles of balancing one's self, personal and professional life.<br /><br />Mr. Luckett keeps the readers guessing throughout the novel as secrets are revealed.  Some portions of the novel will have you laughing out loud and other portions will have you shaking your head in disbelief.  There are several steamy and freaky love scenes that seem almost unbelievable, however, the sex is tempered with great character development.  Honestly, I hated for the novel to end because I felt like I knew the characters intimately, almost too intimately.  HOW YA LIVIN' is well written and expounds a wonderful message in the end.

Incarcerated	In MEMOIR: DELAWARE COUNTY PRISON, author Reginald Hall painstakingly chronicles his sojourn as a prison inmate.  Using a very clear, simple and precise writing style, Hall essentially unveils a story filled with all the nuances, innuendoes and uncertainties of prison life.  More importantly, MEMOIR: DELAWARE COUNTY PRISON gives insight into the indignities suffered by an eighteen year old, who also happens to be gay, in an environment where machismo is the dominant culture.<br /><br />Hall's unobtrusive writing style adds an edge to the story, but this is blurred by his introduction of characters that are often superficial or one dimensional.  The story never quite reaches its true potential and often the reader is left with the sense that there are exciting and at times dangerous possibilities lurking beneath the author's straightforward prose, which are never fully realized.<br /><br />MEMOIR: DELAWARE COUNTY PRISON is a valiant first effort for noted gay rights advocate Reginald Hall.  He manages to capture the readers attention with the possibilities the title seems to offer, and it does have its bright moments.  The story, however, would benefit from more attention to detail especially in the area of character development.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26

After witnessing the fear from this mere child, Samuel decides the only thing left to do is leave. He departs for a trip around the world, leaving his bride still a virgin.<br /><br />THE WEDDING NIGHT is set in 1820 in London, England, some four years since Cassandra last saw her husband.

She knows Samuel provided for her generously during the last four years while he lived a very colorful life moving from one city to another.  She still harbors deep resentments about her wedding night and the humiliation she faced.  Her only thought is to gain her freedom and maintain an air of respectability, but she must first have permission from Samuel for a separation.  He, on the other hand, has other intentions and a separation was not a part of it. His original plan was to wait until she grew up before consummating the marriage and then take his rightful place in society.  After a chance meeting between them in the theatre, a separation is out of the question.  In fact, he comes up with a scheme to appear agreeable to her proposal while at the same time deviously plotting to seduce her.<br /><br />As Samuel puts his plan in motion, he discovers that much has gone astray in his absence.  Someone has been stealing from him, there are those that have designs on his wife, and the family that he felt deserted him has been meddling in his affairs.  To complicate things further, Samuel finds himself completely entranced with Cassandra and very protective of her.  Will Cassandra gain her independence?  Has Samuel bitten off more than he can chew?<br /><br />In her fifth book of the Rosebuds series, Barbara Dawson Smith has written an action-packed historical romantic tale that continues the story of the three matchmaking grandmothers.

If these walls could talk	Have you ever wondered what would resonate if the hearts of men<br /><br />emitted strong musings without a buffer? With POETRY FROM THE<br /><br />BOTTOM OF MY HEART, Vincent Alexandria has done just that. This is<br /><br />a poetic compilation of soul stirring, provocative emotions from<br /><br />a man with a chivalrous heart and the courage to share it.<br /><br />The poems and prose run the gamut of heartfelt emotions and also<br /><br />express the stinging aftermath of misguided affection. His writing<br /><br />touches on the richness of having the freedom to say what you feel<br /><br />in your heart, opposed to merely expressing words from the mind. He<br /><br />eloquently shares his perception of the women who compliment life.<br /><br />He ends the book with short stories that culminate the good and the<br /><br />bad of emotional entanglement when expressing the many moods of the<br /><br />heart.<br /><br />Mr. Alexandria's writing feels like the soft stroke of a man with<br /><br />a slow hand, and the sensual photographs add an eveloping aura to<br /><br />the book. I urge you to pick up a copy and lose yourself to his<br /><br />sensitive touch.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
Living in silence	There are certain words society considers taboo, 'impotence'<br /><br />is one of them. It is still one of the most misunderstood health<br /><br />conditions, partly because it carries a stigma, in the minds of<br /><br />many that suggests failure. Ms. Marie puts emphasis on the<br /><br />metamorphosis that can occur, due to stress, when a husband cannot<br /><br />consummate the physical aspect of marriage. And after reading<br /><br />IMPOTENCE: THE DARK SIDE, some questions about this condition will<br /><br />be answered.<br /><br />Ms. Marie uses this book to tell her story and share the emotional<br /><br />turmoil couples experience when a man denies that his impotence is<br /><br />real. As a result of her emotional roller coaster ride, her life took<br /><br />a destructive path. She was consumed by 'the dark side': depression,<br /><br />memory shut down, alcoholism and suicide attempts. After the emotional<br /><br />dust settled, she started a crusade to educate those who have lost<br /><br />themselves and feel trapped in a hopeless situation.<br /><br />Using excerpts from medical journals along with personal interviews<br /><br />she hopes to give credibility to why individuals react so negatively<br /><br />to impotence. Statistically the numbers that equate to impotence are<br /><br />overwhelming, it affects an estimated 30 million men. But what is<br /><br />more astounding is the number of men who choose to placate this<br /><br />situation and fail to seek help.<br /><br />IMPOTENCE: THE DARK SIDE, is divided into sections which describe the<br /><br />condition of impotence and impotence denial, common signs of<br /><br />physical and emotional abuse, and gives resources where readers can<br /><br />obtain help for themselves. With this information Ms. Marie hopes to<br /><br />remove the associated stigma and increase the awareness of readers.<br /><br />This is a bold step for a writer entering the literary arena.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
A depressing life	As a child Alicia Maldonado moves from her native Cuba to Haiti and must learn a new language and a new culture. Alicia's brother Mario fits right in but Alicia has to work at it. Richard, the boy next door who is near her age, helps her with the transition. Richard's family is of the elite mulattos of the island and they aren't exactly happy about his association with the white Cuban girl, but neither is Alicia's mother thrilled to have her daughter associating so closely with a mulatto. In spite of their families' reservations, they grow up, marry and have two children. It should have been 'happily ever after' but since life seldom is, a number of unsettling situations occur and Alicia wonders what she has done to be the target of so many tragedies. Because she is unable to withstand the many blows that life delivers, she frequently goes into deep depressions. One of her moods leads her to life changing decisions that affect everyone around her.<br /><br />ALICIA MALDONADO: A MOTHER LOST is an interesting novel that gives a vivid picture of life among the elite and the middle class of Haiti. It also plunges us to the depths of despair and poverty with Alicia as she moves through her star crossed life. While it is well written, it lacks a certain tension and suspense that would keep the pages turning.<br /><br /> Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br /> of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
A Perfect World...	In a perfect world, Perry Richards would not be running around in a<br /><br />circle, trying to bring stability to his life. In a perfect world he,<br /><br />would be secure in the love of his family instead of wondering where<br /><br />they were. But this is not a perfect world.<br /><br />Perry and Felicia Richards are the beautiful black couple on the<br /><br />wedding cake, living the American dream. Perry is slated to assume<br /><br />directorship of a public interest law firm. Felicia is a dynamic<br /><br />therapist and quite proficient in her field. What should have been a<br /><br />dream weekend of rest and relaxation at their cottage getaway turns<br /><br />into a nightmare. Felicia does not meet Perry, and then she's gone.<br /><br />Perry returns home looking for answers, only to find a letter and<br /><br />videotape from his wife asking him to trust her. When Perry returns<br /><br />to his office he finds more chaos; evidence of embezzlement and<br /><br />double dealing. His commitment is divided, he has to find his wife<br /><br />and he needs to establish security with his job.<br /><br />Felicia, his greatest concern, seems to have disappeared into a<br /><br />vacuum and he is left with empty leads and too many unanswered<br /><br />questions. Why is his wife testing the trust in their marriage? Why<br /><br />is someone trying to kill him? Is her disappearance foul play, revenge<br /><br />by a vengeful client or maybe an affair? The drama surrounding his job<br /><br />and Felicia's disappearance somehow seems to connect and Perry is more<br /><br />confused than ever. Sabotaging Perry's search, causing his emotions to<br /><br />spiral in the wrong direction, is his overzealous colleague, a<br /><br />seductive lawyer, who is determinately seeking his affections. Will she<br /><br />get them?<br /><br />A PERFECT WORLD is a fast paced tale of murder and intrigue surrounded<br /><br />by the perils of racial and social politics. But the core of this<br /><br />story is a family's secrets. McNealy displays a command of the language<br /><br />and writes with an extensive vocabulary.

Living a dream	In THE BIG HORSE, Joe McGinniss tells the story of one horse trainer's desire and longing to have a horse that will bring fame as well as riches to his stable.  This book may surprise McGinniss' readers, as this one does not have the spicy twist and turns we are accustomed to in his former books.  Instead, McGinnis tells a truly unique and inspiring story about P.G. Johnson and a horse named Volponi.  In his sixty years as a trainer, P.G. Johnson has never had a big horse.  He has bred and trained some of the best, but none of them could compare to thoroughbreds like Funny Cide, Secretariat or Seabiscuit who all won races that brought in purses that totaled in the millions.  He is an authority on training horses and well respected in the industry.  As Joe McGinniss follows him from racetracks at Saratoga, to Belmont to the Aqueduct, we learn about the industry in all its glory and get a peek at the seamy underbelly of the profession.  P.G. gives a blow-by-blow account of what it's like to be a horse trainer and have all your heartaches, desires and dreams tied to that one horse that can hopefully bring it all home.  Volponi may be P.G.'s final chance at the big horse.<br /><br />This was a well-written and very interesting read.  McGinniss did not disappoint readers with his storytelling abilities.  I was catapulted into the horse racing industry in its current state, which is a sport on the decline. I was also allowed glimpses into the past when horse racing was the sport of the season and spectators came in droves to the tune of tens of thousands.  The journey included walks with trainers, jockeys and owners to get a complete taste of what this sport is about.  For those that love the sport of horse racing, this book is a must have.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
A kiss to die for	&quot;Dark-Hunters are immortal protectors who save human beings from the vampires who prey on them.&quot; -Sherrilyn Kenyon<br /><br /> In KISS OF THE NIGHT, the fifth of the Dark-Hunter books, readers are introduced to Cassandra Peters and Wulf Tryggvasen. Cassandra is a descendant of mythical Greek bloodlines that has their roots in the city of Atlantis from hundreds of years ago. Cassandra carries the future of her race if she can make it past her 27th birthday. There is another race, the evil Daimons who would like to see Cassandra dead. Daimons are vampires that have been banished to the darkness by a curse that Cassandra's death would reverse. However, her death would also mean the end of the world. Wulf is a Dark-Hunter. He is an immortal Viking warrior that has hunted and killed the likes of Cassandra's race and Daimons for many years. A chance meeting in a club of questionable reputation puts all three adversaries together at once. What emerges after the melee is a love story that starts out as a kiss and a dream, but transcends all evil and unites Wulf and Cassandra together in a fight for their lives.<br /><br /> KISS OF THE NIGHT is an action-packed thriller that incorporates some steamy sex, a little tinkering from the gods, a dash of mystery and a hefty dose of evil vampires with powers that are out of this world. Sherrilyn Kenyon has put together enough drama to make you want to hold onto the seat of your pants for this rather bumpy and thrilling ride. As with all of the Dark-Hunter books, this one is a stand-alone and I was able to pick up on the action and keep up. Although the story surrounding the hero and heroine was a little unbelievable at times, it was the depth and stories of the supporting characters that held my interest and kept me in this one. A fascinating read.<br /><br /> Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br /> of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
Let the truth be told	Have you ever pondered the \\"real\\" reason behind the Civil War? Have you ever questioned the history books or the reported truths about slavery?  Did you ever wonder how slavery survived so long in the history of the United States?  Well, in SLAVERY AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, Stanley K. Lott completes a detailed study of the Constitution and the archives of The Congressional Globe and uncovers some facts that may astound and surprise some about this hotly debated topic:  Is the Federal Government responsible for allowing the existence of slavery in the United States?  He, in fact, states and provides supported documentation that the Federal Government protected, sanctioned, supported and sustained American slavery.  He also shows that the Civil War, hailed by some historians as a fight to free slaves, was actually fought over taxes.  Or to be more specific, the South's desire not to pay federal taxes on property to the Union.  His desire is that once people realize that the U.S. Government protected slavery and slave trade, Blacks and Southern Whites can get beyond the anger and guilt, respectively.<br /><br />Mr. Lott provides a good bit of ammunition to support that the Federal Government bears the burden of the results of slavery and slave trade in America.  He offers up all of his research and encourages others to do some research of their own.  I felt this book was interesting and provided some insight to things that the history books did not cover.  I thought it was a little too heavy on the documentation side for such a relatively small book and could've benefited from additional editing.  Aside from that, this little book packs a lot of information and lays the foundation for more serious study of Uncle Sam's involvement in slave trade.  Mr. Lott should be applauded for his efforts to educate.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
For The Love Of Money	MOTHER ETERNAL ANN EVERLASTING'S DEAD is a light hearted parody of a centuries-old institution; the African-American Church. It proves to be a satiric yet uncannily believable portrayal of the various faces of church folks and their oft times melodramatic way of life. Overflowing with bizarre and often scathing humor Pat G'Orge-Walker does a tremendous job in poking fun at the greed, hypocrisy and pretentiousness that goes on in the name of religion.<br /><br /> This incredibly humorous story takes on a life of its own when megalomaniacal Mother Eternal Ann, the congregations chief benefactor, drops dead slumped over the church's cash register, apparently from a heart attack. The rumor mill immediately starts churning and soon word gets out that she had actually died of an overindulgence of York Peppermint Patties, which coincidentally were linked to the demise of her two husbands.<br /><br /> When it becomes known that Mother Eternal Ann's last wishes was for her friend Sister Betty to distribute million dollar checks to three &quot;mega-pastors&quot; at a conference in Baltimore, the resident pastor, Reverend Knott Enuff Money is chagrined. He forms his own Baltimore bound crew, all the time scheming to abscond with the checks. The boisterous hilarity reaches fever pitch, with the farcical antics of the entourage, led by Sister Betty, with Reverend Knott Enuff Money and his scheming cortege in tow.<br /><br /> MOTHER ETERNAL ANN EVERLASTIN'S DEAD has a depth that transcends simple satire. The characters are well developed, though outrageous, which lends to the deeply entertaining quality of the book. Pat G'Orge-Walker's apparent ability to keep readers captivated with the ludicrous antics of her characters makes for a<br /><br /> rip-roaringly comical read. She has scored a definite coup with this one.<br /><br /> Reviewed by Autumn<br /><br /> of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
A journey through poetry	OH WHAT A JOURNEY is a collection of approximately 15 poems that catalog Jonquille's views on relationships and life. Opening with a poetic dedication to God, she sets the tone for some of her softer and more endearing testimonials, while other pieces reveal the harsher realities of her existence. These poems cover many facets of her life, moving from the reason for her moniker to describing her interactions with various loved ones. She even devotes a poem to hairstyles.<br /><br /> Jonquille's journey will touch a part of those women who have traveled the same path. She captures well the loneliness felt due to the absence of her father in \\"Daddy Where are You?\\" She focuses in on the feelings of lust in \\"Plastered\\" and \\"Bedazzled.\\" In \\"Bloody Bay,\\" which actually seems like a short story, she tells about the hopelessness and frustrations one may feel when trapped in a one-sided relationship filled with mistrust. In my favorite of the collection, \\"Imagine,\\" she pulled me into her wonderings about what it could be like if you were secure in the love of your mate.

Are all men alike?	Innocent and overly protected by her father who is a minister, Gloria has the misfortune of running into Earl when she is 22 years old. Her father does not approve of him and neither does her mother, yet she manages to sneak around and see him on the sly. Before she even knows what happened, she is pregnant. Of course Earl is not interested in doing the right thing as witnessed by other baby mommas.<br /><br />Having no other choice, Gloria raises Horatio, whom she named after her father, on her own with some outrageous interference from Earl. Two step-dads later, Horatio is a man in his own right. Unfortunately, even though he knows what it means to not have a father, he becomes something of an image of his mostly absent biological dad.<br /><br />While Horatio's exploits were intensely interesting, occasionally I felt that surely no man would really behave that way. Then I reminded myself that I was seeing it from a woman's perspective and so I bowed to author, d. E. Rogers's version of what really happened. It was a very interesting book and I read it quickly. The characters, for the most part, rang true and the plot literally forced you to keep reading to find out how it would end. When it did end, I wasn't quite sure what happened and had to read the ending twice. It was a good book that everybody would enjoy, but young black men should especially pick it up.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-26
Living with betrayal	Betrayal is a cruel thing to live with.  When a child feels a parent has betrayed him, his actions can be cold and calculating in an attempt to lash out against the pain.  In SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE ON TOP, Darious Jones feels betrayed by his mother, Jada Jones.  He has a long list of wrongs against her and chief among them is the fact that she withheld the identity of his biological father for twenty years.  Using her guilt about her participation in the outcome of his life, Darious persuades Jada to loan him a million dollars to start his own company.  But little does she know, he plans to massage that guilt until she has repaid her debt to him fully.  Believing that his mother is a treacherous woman, Darious translates that into all women being the same and as a result, he has no compassion for the women he meets.  He feels that the words love and sex should not be uttered in the same sentence.  Women are there to make \\"Slugger\\" happy.  With a voracious sexual appetite, he cannot be faithful to one woman nor is he trying to be.<br /><br />Jada and her husband, Wellington, have led a very colorful life to say the least and there are those who would love to hear all the delicious details.

Darious wants his company, Somebody Gotta Be On Top, to walk away with a contract for the manuscript. This will be the chance of a lifetime for him. In his vie to be the one on the top, he must first get past Ciara Monroe, keep all his other playmates in check and hide his less than savory dealings from Ashlee, the one woman he thinks he loves above all else.  With his attention diverted in several different directions and women, he becomes vulnerable to a takeover scheme from the one he least suspects.  As he plots his way to the top, who will be on his list of casualties? Or will he be a casualty himself?<br /><br />This fourth book of the series is an action-packed page-turner in which Mary B.

Silent Terror	A BLACK BUTTERFLY is an account of the author's endurance through harrowing episodes of physical, sexual and emotional abuse.  Although it unfolds into a story of misery, suffering and betrayal of trust, it is also one of hope, as the author has used the writing of her story as a means to reach out and help other victims.  She has also created The Children's Foundation, an organization also designed to help other victims of abuse.<br /><br />Using very graphic descriptions of her experiences, Lea Marie gives the reader insight into the stark terror experienced by abuse victims, and relates the deep feelings of disappointment and betrayal she felt, especially when terrorized by an older brother whom she initially idolized. This story will leave the reader shocked but filled with admiration for the writer's ability to move forward after the abuses she suffered.<br /><br />Lea Marie's story is not a pleasant one but is one that needs to be told.<br /><br />Given the subject matter, A BLACK BUTTERFLY probably would have been a more absorbing read, with better attention to character development and plot direction.

She shared shoes and clothing with an elder sister, and at lunch recess at school, she and her siblings would go into the woods to find berries and anything edible to quiet their hunger pangs.<br /><br />As she briefly touches on the lives of her parents, her sisters, brothers and her children, there seem to be so many hidden stories that could have been expanded into novels all by themselves.

Can this family survive?	David, the former football star that was injured in a game, is on drugs. He feels he can no longer shine in his father's eyes and he buries his sorrow with a crack pipe.  His younger brother Jonathan, the perfect one, has a secret that will make him a lot less perfect if his father ever discovers it. Rachel is searching for love in all the wrong places and is determined, regardless of the roadblocks, to get that love. Loretta, the properly submissive wife, is watching her family slowly fall apart. Simon is far too busy being the perfect minister of Zion Hill Church to realize that his family is disintegrating and that it just might have something to do with him. Instead he castigates his children for embarrassing him, sometimes not even speaking to them for months on end. Finally a family crisis brings it all to a head. Will the family survive? Or will they all go their separate ways, mired in hate, distrust and anger? Can anything bring them together again?<br /><br />ReShonda Tate Billingsley has written a riveting novel that explores the dark underside of the \\"perfect\\" family. There is drama, suspense and humor as the Jacksons play out their angst behind closed doors. The characters are developed so well it is almost as if you knew these people personally. It is easy to slip into their lives, their points of view, their fears, happiness and pain. It is well written and hard to put down until that final page.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-25
Does the church support peace?	Andreas Thomas takes on world wide Christianity in his attempt to understand the church, what it stands for and what it stands against. He takes issue with the church, or rather those representatives of the church who feel they are so enlightened that any difference of opinion with widely held beliefs constitutes a loss of sheep from its flock.<br /><br />He discusses the rightness or wrongness of Clinton's decision to intervene in Kosovo. After all, Clinton professes to be a Christian, yet can reign down terror on innocents. Was there another way to bring about a government change without bombing helpless civilians? And why was the church silent on the collateral damage that was caused by the bombing? In addition, he discusses the problems of sex, marriage and birth control in what he calls The Holy Terror of Ethics. Does the church have to frighten people about sex in order to make a point?<br /><br />It was an interesting book and raises several questions about modern day Christianity that are certainly worth consideration. I do feel that something was lost in the translation from Greek to English that left the book just a bit hard to read because the language was somewhat stiff and formal.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-25
Hip Hop vs. Old School?	It is probably obvious to any thinking Black American that the movement toward an equitable society is lacking in leadership today. The old school civil rights leaders are not connecting with the Hip Hop generation and the Hip Hop generation does not relate to where the civil rights leaders from the sixties and seventies are coming from. Yvonne Bynoe explores the reasons for this disconnect in the Black community. Her book, STAND AND DELIVER, is rich with the history of the civil rights era and also delves deeply into the psyche of the Hip Hop generation. She is equitable in placing responsibility for shortcomings from both generations where they belong and gives credit where it should be given. Bynoe thoughtfully explores the history and the reasoning behind each generation and gives reasonable explanations about why people do the things they do.<br /><br />What makes her book an outstanding read is that she doesn't just ask the questions; she also provides reasonable solutions and outlines exactly how activism can once more be a part of the Black community. She gives concrete suggestions for the questions the Hip Hop generation must ask, such as how do we make America an equitable society. She even gives information on how to disagree without destroying a movement. In addition, she reminds those from other generations that they must come to the Hip Hop generation as equals, not with a snobbish attitude that suggests that they know without a shadow of a doubt, how to solve the problem of inequality in America. Bynoe also reminds us that in the new century, we can no longer exclude people from the movement because of race, class, or economic condition but we must find a common ground to insure that all Americans have an equal chance to be the best that they can. I frequently found myself nodding in agreement as I read her words. She is a voice to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-25
Too Much Like Right	K.D. Greene has again written poetry that expresses some joys and<br /> sorrows of a working class generation. The poetry highlights the<br /> day-to-day mechanics needed to survive, and emphasizes that often<br /> surviving demands more than simply living. Her poetry is about the<br /> frustrations of getting up each day, punching that 'clock', be it<br /> mental or mechanical. She loves to take the nuances of life and<br /> sprinkle them across the pages.<br /><br /> One title caught my eyes as it embodies the essence of TOO MUCH<br /> LIKE RIGHT 2. It's titled &quot;Sometimes&quot; and I'll share just one<br /> realistic verse:<br /><br /> 'Sometimes you have to do what you need to do<br /> In order to take good care of you<br /> Even if you need to call in sick<br /> and you are physically well'<br /><br /> I will describe this as a book of simple, candid, real truisms of life.<br /><br /> Reviewed by aNN<br /> of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-25
More than just a building	In IDA B., Karen E. Quinones Miller takes us on an incredible journey in the life of the residents of the Ida B. Barrett Wells Tower in Harlem. That?s right, Ida B. is a building, but not just any building.  The Ida B. is a twenty-year-old, low-income apartment building inhabited by many colorful and eclectic individuals from all walks of life.  The Ida B. is the center of their life, the place they call home.  Many people have lived and died there, having known no other residence than the Ida B.  The residents all know one another, look out for one another, and keep each other?s secrets...well sort of.  Nothing happens in this building without everybody finding out about it.<br /><br />Brenda Carver, an aspiring author, has issues with men and relationships in general.  Having made many wrong choices concerning men, she is raising four kids from different fathers and she?s only in her mid-twenties.  Because of her race, many in the building do not like Brenda?s best friend, Rosa Riviera, who is an aspiring actress.  That Latin temper works everybody?s nerves.  Sharif, best friend of both Brenda and Rosa, is an out of the closet homosexual living as a self-appointed community activist.  Everybody runs to Sharif for help when in trouble.<br /><br />Through these three main characters we meet many of the other vibrant residents of Ida B., for instance, Mrs. Harris, an 80-something grandmother posing as the local fence; Aunt Pat, the drunk who is a regular visitor that nobody messes with; and Vincent, the local go-to man with a history of handling his business.  When a brutal murder is committed against one of their children, they pull together to do a little investigating, complete with some serious finger pointing and gossiping.  When the killer is finally revealed, some move to execute their own brand of street justice to make it right.  Just when it looks like everything is about to return to normal, all the residents receive a notice that they?ve been dreading for some time.<br /><br />Ms. Miller has crafted yet another realistic, poignant, and gut-wrenching tale about the trueness of life on the streets of Harlem.  She continues her honest, no holds barred style of presentation, where she shares all the ups and downs of life in what some would say is the lower echelon of society; where unemployment is high, hustling is a way of life, and government assistance is a reality. I felt that I was a part of the Ida B. community for the two days I spent with this book.  Each character has his or her own story weaved into the fabric of the book, even if I didn?t care for him or her.  I was entranced from the beginning until the end.

The Hamptons...	Newly divorced Joelle Sinclair is ready to start a new life, in a new city, with a new outlook on life. She moves from New York City to a beachfront home in the Hamptons and quickly finds a position as a manager of an art gallery. When attorney Jabari Mitchell walks into Joelle's life, warning flares light up the sky: he's too handsome, too rich, too kind, too passionate, too good to be true. Though leery of men, she pushes her misgivings about Jabari aside.<br />From the first moment Jabari saw Joelle, he knew she'd suit his purposes. He approaches her, but because of an unfaithful husband, she finds it difficult to trust. He is a man on a mission and refuses to give up. He wines and dines her, working his way through her defensive shields, eventually showing his true colors.<br />I felt more time should have been spent developing the suspense angle of the novel. Ms. Grosvenor could have given us clues, outside of the heroine's gut feelings, that something might be amiss. The main plot and Joelle's character were well developed, but the subplot and Jabari's character development were rushed. I found myself saying, \\"That Jabari's too good to be true. What's he up to?\\" Overall, THE HAMPTONS was an enjoyable read. Though the pace was slow, Ms. Grosvenor kept my attention.<br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-13
Making choices...	From the time she was old enough to understand, Candace Turner was taught by her mother to never date a man who was not extremely wealthy; one who could not provide the finer material things of life. When Jeff White, a UPS driver, expresses an interest in her, Candace immediately snubs him because of his job and her screwed up standards, although she is attracted to him.<br />Jeff, who is only working for UPS to put himself through medical school, has been attracted to Candace since the first time he saw her. After months of building up his courage, he finally decides to ask Candace out, only to be shot down like a rabid dog. Amazingly enough, after that humiliating episode, he continues to pursue her in hopes that she will change her mind. It's only after several more rejections and the knowledge that she has another man more suited to her standards that Jeff decides to move on with his life. Will Candace come to her senses before it's too late, or because of her standards, will she subject herself to a life that is emotionally unsatisfying?<br />LADIES CHOICE was a very disappointing read for me. The characters were shallow and there was no real plot development. There were many times I wanted to jump through the pages and slap some sense into the characters. I found myself anxious to finish this novel in hopes that it got better, but sadly it didn't.<br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-10

Their hands have toiled in ways that we will never know. Their arms have offered comfort through some of life's most challenging times. Their eyes have shed tears of sadness, while their hearts have leapt for joy at the achievements of their people.  These are the ones that have stories to tell that are typically not passed down in the history books.  These valedictorians of the school of hard knocks are our Black grandmothers.<br />The pages in this book pass on infinite pearls of wisdom, causing the reader to give pause and reflect on each letter.  In one letter, a grandmother writes, &quot;It is not enough to be good; we must be good for something.&quot;  Another writes, &quot;When you serve others first, you serve yourself best.&quot;  This book offers profound wisdom that does its very best to capture the epitome of the human spirit.  One particular letter that touched me stated to always remember that you are &quot;still a student, still learning every day to be human...to have a live a life full of grace and mercy.&quot;<br />Mr. Kimbro should be commended for his efforts and shown sincere appreciation for setting about the task of collecting the wisdom of our elders, our grandmothers.

Davvy, a recent transplant to Washington, DC becomes a student of the life and times of high society there.<br />Davvy takes up residence in the boarding house of Margaret Rhodes and there he makes the acquaintance of many interesting people, including Caroline Rhodes.

Unbeknownst to Davvy, Caroline is interested in him, however he does not consider her as a love interest because she is many years his junior.  Through the letters, the story is revealed.  Much to his surprise, Davvy develops feelings for Caroline.  At this time of realization Davvy must discover whether it is too late for or will Davvy and Caroline be able to overcome their difference and succumb to the possibility that love holds for them?<br />This novel is unique in its portrayal of boy meets girl.  It provides an interesting glimpse into the 1920's.  The book speaks to inter-race and societal issues.  It captured my attention through its use of vivid details and genuineness, yet it was not a major page-turner that compelled me to want to read on. I think it is a decent read that offered a refreshing twist on the unfolding of a relationship.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03
Informative	In SURVIVING FINANCIAL DISASTERS, Tiffany R. Love seems to cover all of the major areas of financial upheaval that may wreak havoc on one's life.  From bankruptcy to foreclosure to auto repossessions to evictions, this book is complete, clear and informative.<br />Ms. Love delves into many topics, the most complete area is the bankruptcy section.  Speaking from her personal experiences, Ms. Love provides us with the 411 regarding the most common types of bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy. . .we've all heard about it but what is it really and how does one learn about the process?  This book does a wonderful job of explaining the two types of bankruptcy - Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 and the differences between the two.  Also, it explores such interesting topics as whether you can declare bankruptcy and keep your property.<br />Foreclosures are another financial disaster that is highlighted in the book.  Ms. Love urges her readers to avoid rushing into a definitive decision that may cause an avalanche of other financial grief to rain down on them.  Stressing that setting objectives is paramount and planning does not require cash, Ms. Love clearly sheds light on an otherwise dark situation.<br />For anyone who has fallen down on their luck and is seeking some common sense and guidance, then you may want to consider SURVIVING FINANCIAL DISASTERS for your financial repertoire.  Some sections of the book such as bankruptcy, foreclosures and auto repossessions are fairly extensive.  Whereas some areas of the book, such as eviction is well-presented but not as broadly covered.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03

In PRACTICAL VIRTUES: EVERYDAY VALUES &amp;<br />DEVOTIONS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES, the authors/pastors give guidelines<br />for living virtuously that are wonderfully illustrated with examples from<br />African-American literature.<br />Courage, diligence, faith, forbearance, forgiveness, honesty, love, loyalty,<br />prudence, responsibility, service, and trustworthiness are the qualities<br />presented. The book is divided into sections which are titled by their<br />respective virtues.  Each section includes a number of literary examples which<br />is followed by exercises for discussions or journaling on the story.  The<br />authors suggest reading the book as a family devotional and spending a week on<br />each section.  The content of this book is meaty enough to warrant more time<br />reading and reflecting on the principles that are presented.<br />I was particularly moved by a number of the slave narratives which are<br />included in various sections of the book.  The strength of our ancestors is so<br />indicative of virtuous living that reading their words, for me, at times was<br />overwhelming. In the Courage section, Ellen and William Craft's story of their<br />escape from slavery is told and it is nothing short of phenomenal.  The Crafts<br />sought freedom by Ellen dressing up as a man and William serving as her<br />servant as they made there way out of the South on a train.  The authors could<br />have stopped there with their discussion on courage, but they went on to share<br />so much more.<br />PRACTICAL VIRTUES is an inspiring collection of all that is notable and<br />convicting in African American literature.  Families who make the commitment<br />to read it together will undoubtedly grow stronger and closer as a result.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of the RAWSISAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03

Overall I enjoyed the novel, but I had difficulties with one of the major subplots.  India's \\"virginity\\" plays a major role in the novel yet it is blatantly clear by the end first chapter that she is not a virgin.

Unearthing the Roots	Throughout history, society has defined exactly what it means to be a \\"man.&quot;  From birth, men and women together learn that men are providers, protectors, emotionally detached, and physically stronger.  In an effort to reinforce such beliefs, society created gaps between men and women in almost all arenas of life: the workforce, personal hobbies, appearance, and relationship roles.  Due to the creation and nurturing of such roles, it has become difficult for men to love and to express any kind of emotion (except anger)...it has also become difficult for women to understand men and how to love them.<br />In her novel THE WILL TO CHANGE: MEN, MASCULINITY, AND LOVE, feminist scholar bell hooks sets upon the task of unearthing the roots of masculine thinking.  She sheds light on patriarchy, on masculine emotion, and how together they affect men from infancy to manhood. She includes quotes from journalists, psychologists, and other feminine theorists to support and clarify her opinions. THE WILL TO CHANGE is an informative, thought-provoking work that strikes at the very soul of our society. Reading like a college psychology text, it can be a little dry in spots, however, hooks shows readers how deeply misguided she believes our society to be and how difficult it is to change the very basis of our foundation.  Author bell hooks is a passionate, highly educated woman, and while most of what she writes is disturbing and often difficult for me to swallow, I appreciate her contribution to the education of our society.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03

Showing the trials and tribulations of pledging and adding unexpected twist that may compromise the future of Beta at Carver and the acceptance of Eva's pledge class into the Beta organization, BE MY SORORITY SISTER will have the reader wondering what's next.<br />Although I am not a member of a Greek organization, I feel that Ms. Williams-Wheeler wonderfully captures campus life and the situations a young lady may face while pledging, including what may be perceived as hazing.  Additionally, I think this book would be a wonderful book club selection because not only would it lend itself to an interesting discussion, Ms. Williams-Wheeler has conveniently included a discussion guide at the end of the book to encourage a group discussion.  I will look forward to reading future works by this prolific writer.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03
Written in the Stars	Some say one's destiny is written in the stars; however, others believe one's personality is determined by how the planets were aligned at their birth.  Most people know their astrological sign, and while most don't govern their lives by the hogwash spewed out by local tabloids, there is a shimmer of truth in each observation.  It is that shimmer that draws us to read more and wonder, \\"Is that really me?\\" And it is that shimmer authors Rob Marriott and Sonya Magett expound on in their joint work, ASTROLOGY UNCUT.<br />Unlike most books on astrology, ASTROLOGY UNCUT appeals to the present generation, to modern minds. Without coming off as the be-all/end-all, this book offers science-based knowledge for \\"the edification of attention-deficient mauf*^#s like yourselves\\" (Astrology Uncut, ix).  Flowing with hip-hop terminology, this special sun sign book is a clear guide towards deepening an understanding of true astrology. Defining customary sign-specific qualities (like whether a sign falls under water, air, fire, or earth) and adding plenty of \\"bonus\\" qualities (like gangstability, booty quotient, and shiest quotient), ASTROLOGY UNCUT cascades valuable information in understanding people and a plethora of fun facts onto its readers.<br />When I first picked up this book, I immediately turned to my sign, Gemini.  After a quick glance, I realized I had no clue what some of the descriptions meant and flipped back to the beginning to gain a proper foundation. This book is hilariously written, making bold, daring observations.  I thoroughly enjoyed ASTROLOGY UNCUT even though the authors repeatedly express that the information presented should be taken with a grain of salt. On a more serious note, I found my knowledge of society and people's behaviors enhanced. My only complaint with the work is the amount of foul language. If you can overcome that obstacle then you're in for an enjoyable and highly educational ride!<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswers	2004-07-03
The Good Life?	GOTHAM DIARIES is a candid look into the cutthroat world of New York City's harsh haute monde penned by two insiders: Tonya Lewis Lee is Spike Lee's wife and Crystal McCrary Anthony was the wife of former NBA star Greg Anthony. From old money matrons to newly rich rap stars, the characters abound in this brazen book.<br />First up in this colorful cast is Manny, a country mouse turned city mouse who built a highly successful career as a real estate broker for the most elite of clients. However, Manny has two very expensive habits in his boy toy and his dream to be inside the Big Apple's upper crust social circle.<br />Tandy is a socialite like no other. She's always been one of the most involved philanthropists in the city, but when her husband dies and leaves her with more debts than money, Tandy sees her social life flash before her eyes. Not to be outdone, she devises a scheme to get her back on her social butterfly course.<br />Lauren Thomas married an older man who happens to be a billionaire. Lauren, an aspiring filmmaker, is turned off by the media attention and social pressure that comes along with being a powerfully rich man's wife. She learns, though, that all that glitters isn't gold, and that the one person she can trust is herself.<br />GOTHAM DIARIES is as enthralling, fast, and captivating as the city in which it is set. Lee and Anthony write flawlessly together; a match made in literary heaven. I was enraptured by the lives of these people and by the setting of the city that never sleeps. Unable to put this book down for long, I feverishly devoured its contents.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03
Unique book of poetry...	M-A-C-N-O-L-I-A  is the story of MacNolia Cox, the first African-American to compete in a national spelling competition.  Due to the racial injustice of her time, the judges used a word not on the official list and as a result she lost the competition.  Although M-A-C-N-O-L-I-A is a collection of poetry, it is difficult to categorize it strictly as such because it is so much more.  This poetic presentation is a history lesson, a documentary, a love story and a tragedy, all in one.<br />M-A-C-N-O-L-I-A is a very uniquely written book of poetry.  It is the first story that I have read in the form of poetry and A. Van Jordan has captured her compelling story with great lyricism.  Words alone can not describe the reading experience.  This story and the poet's words moved me in unspeakable ways.<br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03
A Historical Timepiece	SISTERS IN THE STRUGGLE chronicles the contributions of African American women at the height of the social reform movement in the twentieth century.  It provided a different perspective than what is customarily shed on this era.<br />The book depicts the selflessness of some important historical figures such as well-known Rosa Parks whose stubborn refusal to give up her bus seat sparked an inferno in the Civil Rights Movement.  Mary MacLeod Bethune's achievement of founding Bethune-Cookman College in 1904 to offer higher education opportunities to African American women is chronicled.  The life and times of Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who struggled to tear down the racial dividers at the University of Georgia and won the right to enroll in 1961, as well as many other historical accounts.<br />This book was a book club selection.  Due to the text-book like offerings, we choose a subsection of the book on which to focus.  All in all, the book contributed to a lively discussion as to how women of today are still `in the struggle.'  Although dry at times, the book does provide an insightful peek into our history.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-07-03
Eve Ever After	For as long as she could remember, Evelyn had been in love with one man, her best friend DJ.  Even though they both dated other people, her heart always longed to be with him and have him commit to her.  Following the advice of a mutual friend, Eve sets out to get her man by whatever means necessary.  Her means turns out to be the tricky tool of jealousy.  In an attempt to make DJ jealous enough to leave his current girlfriend and commit to her, Eve jumpstarts a relationship with Travis, an intelligent, attractive Caucasian man. Due to the untimely death of her younger brother Chicago by a white woman, Evelyn's actions rouse a massive whirlwind that soon blows through her world threatening to destroy everything she ever loved.  Eve initially chooses her suitor to shake up DJ, but the ramifications it has on her family turn out to be even worse.  As things continue to spin out of control, Eve is faced with choices she never imagined would come from such a seemingly simple, problem-free ploy to win a man's heart.  On the verge of breaking down under the weighty rocks of consequence, Eve realizes some things about herself, follows her heart, and makes decisions that shock everyone in her circle.<br />FOR CHICAGO by Karen Lee is full of jaw-dropping drama, heart-wrenching realizations, and witty comedy. An entertaining page-turner, I love the drama captured within this book and was often shocked by what I read next. The characters, with all their virtues and imperfections, soundly interact with a solid plot to weave an enjoyable tale of love and deception.  Lee incorporates many social issues in her novel, the most obvious two being coping with death and dealing with cultural relations.  The Tallants' loss is understandable and, to a certain extent, their hatred; therefore, I believe Karen Lee paints a very believable portrait of just how racially prejudiced people can be.  However, one of the subplots in FOR CHICAGO deals with a friend of Eve and her personal problems. While this aspect of the story becomes relevant later, the way the author introduces this character is totally confusing. Right in the middle of getting to know Eve and DJ, Lee throws in an ostensibly random chapter about some girl who seems to have no connection to anyone the reader has previously met. Aside from that, my only other complaint with the novel is how Travis deals with Eve at the end. His change of behavior doesn't fit his character's previously developed personality, isn't believable, and comes across more as a convenient way for Lee to wrap things up.<br />Overall, I enjoyed FOR CHICAGO very much.  The downward spiraling of Eve's life, brought on by her choices, caused me to reflect on my own life and what choices I would have made in her shoes. Just how much of what we do is selfish and how much of our true desires do we sacrifice for others? In the end, she and her parents learn something amazing about their dearly departed Chicago, and through their realization, readers learn a very valuable life lesson.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersWhile this aspect of the story becomes relevant later, the way the author introduces this character is totally confusing.

For the Love of Money	Franklin White's latest literary offering, MONEY FOR GOOD, takes the reader on a wild and crazy thrill ride.  The main character, West Owens, has finally achieved his dream of becoming an entrepreneur when he opens his own garage, but he stands to lose it all when he has to close up shop to serve on jury duty. While performing his civic duty, he meets and befriends Lauren Richards, a resourceful woman who has a \\"get rich quick\\" scheme.  West joins forces with Lauren to convince the jury to free defendant Pete Rossi in exchange for a considerable amount of money.  Little does West know that he is about to have the experience of a lifetime in his quest to have money for good.<br />Franklin White has written a page-turner that draws the reader in from the very first page and does not let up until the last page is turned.  Filled with action, adventure, murder, deceit, police corruption, and laced with a hint of romance, MONEY FOR GOOD aims to satisfy.

Just ask for help	Several years ago and still today, the term sexual abuse was not talked about in the African-American community.  NO SECRETS, NO LIES: HOW BLACK FAMILIES CAN HEAL FROM SEXUAL ABUSE by Robin D. Stone, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, is a book that discloses the actual stories as told by the victims. In each chapter, Stone provides us with self-help instructions in overcoming such a devastating act of violence.<br /><br />In most cases of sexual abuse, the victim is ignored or made to believe that what happened was just their imagination.  Children are easy prey because the perpetrator can easily entice them with money, candy or toys, etc.  The perpetrator can be anyone - a family member, the next-door neighbor, a school employee or the well-respected member of the church. Threats of bodily harm to the victim or members of his/her family, aids the perpetrator in committing this violation.<br /><br />We are all under the assumption that only women are sexually abused, but there are a vast number of men who are abused by men and in some cases women.  Most males do not report that they have been abused because of the label placed on them by society as growing up and becoming gay.  They also deal with issues concerning their masculinity and have feelings of being inadequate and vulnerable.<br /><br />Once a victim has revealed that they have been sexually abused, some are shunned by family members or made to feel that what happened was their fault.  Victims with understanding family members, such in the case of Ms. Stone, sometimes years later, still suffer from being abused.  Through Stone's self-help guides at the end of each chapter, and each survivor that shares their story, victims of sexual abuse will understand that what happened was not their fault.<br /><br />This book was an eye opener for me because it brings to the forefront the effects that being sexually abused can have on the victims.  Even after the abuse has stopped, victims continue to suffer.  NO SECRETS NO LIES: HOW BLACK FAMILIES CAN HEAL FROM SEXUAL ABUSE was very informative and lists many resources for use by victims of sexual abuse.(...)NO LIES: HOW BLACK FAMILIES CAN HEAL FROM SEXUAL ABUSE was very informative and lists many resources for use by victims of sexual abuse.(...)	2004-07-03
A Call to Action	Deborah Day has constructed a manual on mindfulness in the new millennium.  She describes mindfulness as \\"a conscious state of being completely aware and in the present moment.\\" Chock full of information, MINDFUL MESSAGES is somewhat of a guidebook for today's African-American youth and their parents on how to deal with the onslaught of HIV/AIDS, prevention, and the importance of the younger and older generations forming a bond to battle the societal issues in the here and now.<br />One way that Day relays her message of mindfulness is through poetry. In MINDFUL MESSAGES there are 26 poems, one for each letter of the alphabet, that use strong alliteration and powerful lyrics to bring home the intended messages. My favorite of these is entitled \\"Quick Quotes,\\" in which the poet provides short quotes to enrich and enlighten the reader.<br />A glossary of the Akrunda symbols and their meanings, a listing of HIV/AIDS resources nationwide, agreements for youth to adhere to, and stories of people living with HIV/AIDS are also included in the book. These resources, agreements, stories, and guides are the essence of this book, promoting awareness and igniting a call to action.<br />Deborah Day evidently feels strongly about the disconnect between today's youth and their preceding generations. She has put together a formidable resource that the young and old alike should take note of, read, and ponder.(...)	2004-07-03
Does colorism still exist?	When a mother shouts, \\"Don't play in the sun,\\" it can be very innocent. The child might get sunburned, too hot, or dehydrated. If a Black mother shouts that phrase, it can mean something sinister. It can mean, \\"The sun will make you darker\\" or, \\"You're already black enough!\\" It is the legacy that has been handed down to us from the days our ancestors labored under the harsh conditions of slavery. Our darker sisters with African features frequently find themselves at the end of the line of life. They are discriminated against in many ways, from not being selected as beauty queens to being passed over for jobs and promotions. The airwaves and videos are blanketed with images of the lighter, more European looking women. Darker women are still depicted as mammy, Sapphire, the maid or as very angry.<br />Marita Golden has researched the subject and talked to many people in different countries about this color complex that Black people have. She found that whether it's Cuba, Nigeria or the United States, wherever there are black people, they have learned that beauty is defined by the whiteness of skin and features. In Africa and the Caribbean, she found darker women using the bleaching products that were popular at one time in the United States, and no matter where she went, she found that the darker population was always the poorest population.<br />In total fairness, Ms. Golden also talked with her sisters who were lighter in hue and found that they, also, had color issues. While they might be the symbol of European beauty and were pursued by men, they were frequently pursued for all the wrong reasons. They became trophies rather than love objects. She also talked with brunette white women and found that they too are punished for not being blond goddesses.<br />Ms. Golden does more than just skim the surface of this issue. She digs deep to find not only the whys, but what the solutions are. She uses the stunning accomplishments and looks of the tennis stars, the Williams' sisters, to point out that Black can indeed be beautiful. She even discusses why Serena may have gotten that blond weave. She doesn't punish anyone for their choices; rather she seeks to understand those choices in light of the fanatical and frantic push toward European beauty standards that have been foisted on all of us. It is an excellent book and should be read by dark, dark women, light, bright women and yes, even white women. None of us are exempt from this crazy color complex.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerss' sisters, to point out that Black can indeed be beautiful.

Paul's ex-wife left him<br />and has since remarried someone in Compton who is more class-worthy.<br />This is one of the reasons Paul's resentment for Sepia and what she<br />represents is high. But, this attitude could jeopardize all he has<br />worked to achieve. Sepia is a witness in a high profile killing, her<br />safety, to Paul's dismay, becomes another part of his assignment and<br />it increases the tension between them. But this added tension has<br />nothing to do with his assignment or her book. When Sepia's life is<br />threatened Paul finally admits there is something about this woman that<br />calls to him in the most elemental way; but will he lower his<br />resentment and listen?<br />Angela Winters has given readers a wonderful who-dun-it, surrounded by<br />issues which emphasize the pitfalls of stereotyping and show that love<br />is not classified.

Shades of Gray	WALK A STRAIGHT LINE by Zoey Ann Rice features Colleen and Gina, best friends since high school and different as night and day. Set in New York City, both are teachers, however Colleen is an insecure and hopeless romantic and Gina is the ever-present cynic when it comes to relationships with the opposite sex.  As the book opens, we find Colleen and Gina preparing for Colleen's wedding. Colleen's dream has always been to marry and live happily ever after.  Terrance, Colleen's fianc&eacute;, is in a position to provide Colleen with everything she needs and desires, so much so Colleen decides to be a stay at home wife.  Gina has negative feelings about Terrance, feelings that she cannot quite capture into words but as the book progresses those feelings come to pass.  At the same time, pessimistic Gina becomes embroiled in an atypical threesome with Michael, a man she met at Colleen's wedding.  To add fuel to this smoldering fire, Terrance's mother Francine is selfish, meddlesome and manipulative and her story, when revealed, is ripe for the picking.  Additional characters are added and their secrets could be a book unto itself.  Colleen and Gina both pride themselves on walking a straight line but life, as they know it, throws a curve and tests their loyalties to the fullest.<br />Rice has penned a realistic, interesting and unpredictable read but additional editing is needed, hence the average rating.  There are too many grammatical and spelling errors and the names of character at times are misplaced.  However, this is an enjoyable read that pits friends and family against each other in the name of love.(...).	2004-07-03

Such a remarkable story...	There is nothing in the world like seeing someone take a passion and making it into something that not only benefits them, but is a blessing to others as well.  SUCCESS NEVER SMELLED SO SWEET is such a book, as it shares the life story of Lisa Price, the founder of Carol's Daughter, Inc., a line of bath and beauty products.  To be able to read such a remarkable story is indeed a blessing that so many others are now able to receive.  Through her memoir, we're able to see not only a glimpse into the growth and development of a million dollar empire, but also into the strength of one woman who chose to follow her dreams, despite hard times and obstacles along her path.<br /><br />Lisa Price shares her early childhood in Brooklyn and her love for scents as she spent kitchen time with her Trinidadian grandmother.  She gives the reader an inside look at the troubles she faced growing up, the problems in school as well as her inner turmoil with her self-esteem based upon what others were saying about her.  Just when she feels she has hit the bottom as far as her professional life goes, she steps out on faith and though in major debt and unable to get a business loan, she starts her business.  Lisa doles out anecdotes, recipes, and heart-breaks, all the while sharing a part of herself that is warm, inviting, and encouraging to those who may also have troubles finding their way in life.  I particularly loved how she shared her products with people she worked with who later became very famous people; yet, she never seemed to change from the gracious and kind-hearted person she was.  Additionally, she includes some of her favorite recipes as well as pictures through-out the book to give it more of an endearing quality about it.<br /><br />Lisa Price's determination, passion, and drive for what she does slides off the pages of this book and into your very soul.  This book is truly an inspirational story that anyone who reads will benefit from, as you are able to see that it was not until she let go of her fears, her self-doubt, and inability to break away from the past and move forward with what the future may bring that she was able to truly receive the blessings in store for her.  There are exact passages and lines in this book that I felt were written by me on my own journey towards following my passion and entrepreneurship, things I could relate to so closely that they left me in tears.  I give high praise and thanks to Lisa for sharing her story as well as to the person who referred this book to me as I'm one who normally do not read this genre.

My Brother's Keeper	In his eloquent, concisely written murder mystery, THE BLACKBIRD PAPERS, debut author Ian Smith uses his considerable talent to artfully craft a compellingly engaging thriller which is certain to captivate its reader's imagination.<br /><br />When FBI agent Sterling Bledsoe's older brother Wilson disappears and is subsequently found murdered with a racial epithet incised into his chest, a devastated and incredulous Sterling takes on the task of tracking his brother's murderer.<br /><br />As a backdrop for this riveting thriller, Smith uses a picturesque Boston town whose tranquility and beauty starkly contrasts with the brutality of the crime perpetrated against one of its most vital and productive citizens.  Professor Wilson Bledsoe is at the zenith of his career with a lavish life replete with a beautiful, devoted wife, when he suddenly meets his death in what appears to be a racially motivated crime.  But appearances can be extremely deceiving and the debonair Sterling, a self-styled ladies man, finds himself tangled in an elaborate web of deceit, corruption and intrigue, which he attempts to unravel while engaged in a desperate race to preserve his own life.<br /><br />THE BLACKBIRD PAPERS effectively showcases Ian Smith's apparent mastery of his craft.

Compelling...	EDEN, OHIO, the sophomore effort of Philadelphia author Shawne Johnson, is the tale of a beautiful, picturesque city reminiscent of the Garden of Eden.  With lush grass, plentiful gardens, and happy families - it's almost like paradise.  Yet the town, started by the families of runaway slaves, harbors deep dark secrets that go against the foundation upon which they were built.  These secrets eventually tear down the town, making it a shell of what it once was for them and their descendants.<br />In 1860, twelve black families escaped from North Carolina and slavery led by Eliza towards a place of freedom.  Trekking across undeveloped forests using the moon as light, they set out to free themselves from oppression.  A Harriet Tubman of sorts, she helps them to find a beautiful clearing surrounded by ancient trees, flanked by a body of water  -- the beauty needed to rebuild and start their lives.  Things seem to be perfect in Eden, everyone is full from having so much: no hunger, no fear, nothing but exactly what they want and dreamed about prior to settling there.  Twenty-five years later, things start to change and they start to take things for granted, becoming lazy and complacent in their everyday lives, forgetting the sacrifices made by those who came before them.<br />Eliza was the first-born daughter of the founder of Eden (also named Eliza as all first-born girls in the family were named), cares for the town, its people and its growth.  She was left to use her special gifts and powers to head off the danger she felt was lurking on the outskirts and waiting to take hold of Eden.  Shortly thereafter, the first whites settled in Eden and while not completely a surprise, it does bring her worries about the future to the forefront.  The rest of Eden didn't seem too concerned, so they tolerated the white people, never expecting the unthinkable to happen and thrust Eden into the bowels of decay.  To make matters worse, the black residents of Eden go on a vengeful campaign which brings even more of a curse to the city; Eliza standing beside them watching and believing what's done is done, yet knowing that they've changed the course of the town and their legacy.<br />Fast forward to 1932 and another Eliza cares for the town, carrying the burden of what happened to change the town and its people.  They are quick to transform from love to hate, infested with guilt and rage over the deeds of the past.  It's an all out mess in the city of Eden, yet those young and old stay in their beloved city.  And those who have left return to the city to die.<br />With colorful and memorable characters like the different women bearing the name of Eliza, Hawk Eye (who can see death walking alongside people), and Jeremiah, (the town gentle-spirit who returns at the end of the book), and a host of others we see the past, present, and future rolled into one.  From the happy times and triumphs of a family and community to the sadness, downfalls, and hardships both individually and collectively, Ms. Johnson does a wonderful job introducing and fleshing out her characters.<br />Compelling, yet confusing, EDEN, OHIO is a book to be read slowly and leisurely and then possibly read again.  It is one that does indeed make you stop and think of how the sins of our fathers affect the future, but it is such a labor-intensive read.  The hardest part for me was the structure of the book, which included dropped verbs and articles that we normally take for granted in writing.  Even after reading and enjoying the story, I'm still not sure if I like the way it was told.  EDEN, OHIO is a different type of read that some will enjoy while others will put down after the first few chapters.  I would however recommend it, because the book embraces family and community in a love-hate type of relationship in which many will be able to relate.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Looking for Mr. Right	Michelle Stimpson offers up a spiritually challenging yet enjoyable read in her novel BOAZ BROWN.  LaShondra is a Christian woman who has achieved success in most areas of her life.  She is an assistant principal, and when she is not volunteering to work in various ministries at her church, she spends her free time with her family and girlfriends.  LaShondra is single, and after being involved in several dead-end relationships, she renews her faith and decides to be celibate until God sends her the man of her dreams; her very own Boaz (Boaz is a man introduced in the book of Ruth in the Bible and LaShondra considers him an example of an ideal mate.)  When she meets Stelson the two have an immediate attraction.  Stelson seems to possess all the qualities that LaShondra requires in a mate.  He is a successful businessman, a Christian, and like her he is a very active member of his church.  However, there is one criterion that Stelson will never be able to meet and LaShondra is forced to do some serious soul searching, praying, and studying of God's Word before she is able to determine if she is willing or able to venture into a relationship.  She has faith that God will send her \\"Boaz\\", but when He does will she recognize him?<br />I really enjoyed reading this book, primarily because although it was a work of fiction, it challenged me to re-examine my views to see if my thinking was in line with my Christian values.  Many of the characters in the book could serve as spiritual role models because they were very disciplined about studying the Bible, praying and allowing God to direct them on a daily basis.  Still, the characters were human; they made mistakes and had character flaws that any reader could relate to.  The book had a strong spiritual message that the author supported by integrating scripture into the story, yet the book never came across as preachy or overbearing.  Michelle Stimpson is definitely an author to watch.  With interesting sub-plots and a strong set of supporting characters BOAZ BROWN is indeed a page turner.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersong set of supporting characters BOAZ BROWN is indeed a page turner.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay <BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Almost There	Rena Finney's first novel, HALFWAY TO TOMORROW draws you in from the first page when we meet the main character Gwen and her younger sister Tiffany as children.  It is clear from the start that Gwen is destined to be Tiffany's protector, and their childhood exchange reminded me of my own relationship with my younger sister.  From there we jump into the present.  Gwen, Tiffany and their brother TJ are all grown up and their family gathers for a traditional holiday celebration together.  Gwen senses that something isn't quite right with Tiffany; her normal spark seems to be missing and she confronts her sister with her concerns.  They are however, interrupted by long-time friend and \\"adopted\\" family member Patrice, so they drop the conversation.  Tiffany goes back to Atlanta and everyone goes on with life as usual.  Yet Gwen is plagued by a case of hives, which she has learned are usually in response to stress or an omen of some impending doom.  When she and her family learn that Tiffany is hospitalized and critically ill, they all pack up and head to Atlanta where they hold vigil until their beloved family member dies.  This ending of a life is really the beginning of the story.  Gwen struggles to move on after her sister's death and deal with her mother's resentment. After struggling to maintain, she decides to take a leave of absence from work and returns to Richmond, the city where she attended college and where many of her old friends reside.  There she is forced to deal with her inability to commit to long term relationships with men, an unresolved relationship from her past, her sister's death, her mother's rejection, and several other personal issues.<br />HALFWAY TO TOMORROW begins with a bang and this emotional intensity continues through the first several chapters.  Unfortunately, as the story continues this intensity begins to wane and at times the story drags on.  I felt that Gwen's journey to self discovery was moving, but it was too disjointed from the book's opening.  The relationship issues she faced were completely unrelated to her sister's death and it wasn't until the very end of the book that the author attempted to develop a connection between Tiffany's passing and Gwen's present life.  As a result, I felt like this was a book with two distinct stories that were enjoyable enough, but had the author done a better job blending the two storylines this would have been a five-star book.  HALFWAY TO TOMORROW is a noble freshman effort that solidly lands Rena Finney on my \\"authors to watch\\" list.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerse book's opening.

More Than Black and White	A COLOR OF LOVE is set in the sleepy southern town of Burton County, Georgia during the early 1970's. Burton County, like a lot of the South, had always played by its own set of rules and standards, and many particulars of southern life were merely &quot;understood.&quot; Harriet, a beautiful black teenager, and John, a white high school football player, refused to follow these &quot;understood&quot; standards, but also realized it was necessary to keep their love a secret. Their secret is blown wide open when Harriet realizes she's pregnant, and soon after the two are torn apart by an ultimatum from John's racist father.<br />Time and distance does not hinder John and Harriet's love, and with the birth of their daughter Josephine, it only makes their bond stronger. The three are reunited and settle down to a new life in the very town that once shunned them. Harriet and John's love for one another helps them to get through just about anything, including death and betrayal.<br />A COLOR OF LOVE, Jannette Franklin's debut novel, is about the power of love and forgiveness that transcends any color barrier. Although the premise for this book was a good idea, the actual content and writing style were superficial and lacked depth. There were numerous grammatical errors, poor word choices, and an overall need for clearer writing structure. I believe if the author developed more of a plot and gave the story more substance, it would have been a better read.<br />Reviewed by Michelle Warren<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Calling on God...	In the midst of our busy lives, we as humans are sometimes prone to forget to talk to God.  Sure, we will remember to praise Him when things are going right or when a wonderful thing happens to or for us.  We'll also remember to cry out to Him when we are faced with trials and tribulations.  But seldom do we find ourselves just taking a minute of our day to praise Him for being Him, or for the everyday blessings we often take for granted.<br /><br />Dawnn Mitchell's NO WEAPONS is a short, but powerful book of poetry, prayers and praises to the One who is able to deliver us from all evil, the one who is there for us when no one else is.  With every page, I found my heart lifted, my joy restored, and my faith growing stronger.  When you're at a point in your life where you're searching for something this world can't give you, and you just can't express yourself, pick up a copy of this wonderful book.  I know that somewhere in the midst of these 88 pages, you'll find just the right words for any situation you can find yourself in.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Scandalous...	Newspaper reporter Jasmine Carmody wants nothing more than to expose the mighty Danforth family and any secrets they may be hiding.  She is so determined to find any little bit of information that will lend credence to her story that she resorts to digging through the garbage of Wesley Brooks, the Danforth's &quot;adopted&quot; son, who just so happens to have an aversion to reporters.<br />Unfortunately, Jasmine leaves a little memento behind during her foray.  When Wesley finds it, he does a little investigating of his own to find out who it belongs to, how they got onto his private property, and why they were there in the first place.  When he discovers it belongs to Jasmine, he decides to give her a taste of her own medicine by becoming her shadow.  Wherever she goes, he's right there with her.  What is supposed to be annoying soon turns into an intriguing affair of the heart.  Will the couple be able to put aside their differences for a chance at true love, or are they doomed to a lifetime of loneliness and despair?<br />SCANDAL BETWEEN THE SHEETS was a cute, quick read.  While it was not as dramatic, fiery or passionate as Brenda Jackson's other works, it was still an enjoyable read.  Fans new and old are sure to enjoy.<br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Secrets Revealed	In book three of the Shenandoah Girls Series, THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN AIN'T THE COLOR OF YOUR HEART, Michael Phillips continues the story of Mayme and Katie, two young girls, one a recently freed slave, and the other white, as they strive to survive alone on a North Carolina plantation.  In this book, the girls survive a devastating flood, encounter unwelcomed and hostile visitors, and must come up with money to pay off a loan or risk losing their home.  Henry and his son Jeremiah, also freed slaves, check in on the girls at the plantation regularly, providing assistance, protection and oftentimes, sound advice.  In spite of the difficulties they encounter, Mayme and Katie are reunited with friends and family, discover new, shocking family connections, and for the first time a hint of romance enters their lives.<br />Having had the privilege of reading the first two books in the Shenandoah Girls series, I feel I can positively assert that this is the best book in the series.  Although, THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN AIN'T THE COLOR OF YOUR HEART could  stand alone and be a decent read for those unfamiliar with the series, the emotional intensity of the book is heightened by the ongoing relationship readers have developed as they progress through each book in the collection.  In this book, the author does a good job presenting well-rounded characters.  Henry, a recently freed slave, plays a more prominent role in the story and portrays a smart, deeply spiritual, kind-hearted man, who is only limited by the social limitations that he internalized and the society in which he lived.  Henry's son Jeremiah represents a newly freed slave from a different perspective, in that he is young, has big dreams and isn't less accepting of the status quo than Mayme and Henry.  The external pressures of financial difficulties, racism, and the revealing of secrets seemed to regularly creep into the colorless microcosm of society they created on the plantation, yet with Henry's spiritual guidance and the emergence of a new father figure the \\"family\\" continues to thrive and the girls develop a deeper understanding of God.  Emotional, humorous, and spiritually uplifting Michael Phillips has created another heartwarming gem.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersance and the emergence of a new father figure the \\"family\\" continues to thrive and the girls develop a deeper understanding of God.

Snowed...	Ever been so in love with someone that you couldn't see the truth even though it was staring you in the face?  The main character in SNOWED: A LESSON IN LOVE should be the poster girl for this statement.  Sasha Freeman is successful, attractive, intelligent (supposedly) and has no reason whatsoever to be a victim of being snowed.  By being snowed, we mean a person who thought they had one thing, but found out that it was the exact opposite.<br />Despite problems in the past with the &quot;love of her life,&quot; she finds herself caught up in the same drama with him, convinced that he is the one true love that she's destined to be with.  Just when she thinks things are finally well, he's divorced his wife, and he truly loves her, she gets a call to appear on a television talk show.  Convinced that someone from her past wants to proclaim their love for her, she agrees, and what results is something similar to what we see daily on talk shows.  Will it be a Jerry Springer/Ricki Lake fiasco, or will she truly find what she's in search of in a man?<br />Coupled with Sasha's inability to find and keep a man are her girlfriends who are suffering with their own triumphs and then disappointments with the men in their lives.  We witness a cast of dysfunctional women with relationship/men issues who just don't seem capable of moving ahead with their lives.  Instead we see the &quot;one step forward, two steps back&quot; syndrome which quite personally annoyed the heck out of me.  I felt as if I were re-reading passages when in essence it was the same cycle that was in the previous chapter and also the one before that, which left me with a been-there, done-that attitude.  I felt nothing but pity towards the characters and found myself wanting to slip through the pages of the book and issue a few beatdowns.<br />Despite the aforementioned, as well as numerous typographical and structural issues with this book,  I was able to pull out the lesson of the story which basically surrounds loving yourself first and foremost.  It was sad to witness such self-hate in women who took forever (if at all) to come full circle into appreciation and love for oneself.<br />Those in love sometimes see what they want to see in relationships, but it just comes to a point when you have to know that you have indeed been snowed.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Memories of my aunties	As a young girl growing up, the time I spent with my mom's three sisters was always special: the shopping trips, grammar lessons, and unique events will be cherished forever.<br />As I read AUNTIES: THIRTY-FIVE WRITERS CELEBRATE THEIR OTHER MOTHER, memories of times spent with my precious aunts flooded my heart and my mind. The book is divided into five categories: Second Mothers, Independent Spirits, New York Aunts, Role Models and Avenging Angels. The stories, essays and poems share detailed relationships and notable experiences of this eclectic group of writers with the women, who in their own way, influenced the life of each author. The women are from different eras, races, financial backgrounds and locations, but they all had one common thread, the title auntie.<br />Anyone associated with the word aunt should appreciate this wonderful collection, and whether by blood or friendship, being an aunt is an honored role. In this world of blended and extended families  many aunts have assumed the role of mother, confidant, and friend. I share my initial thoughts, this book touched me in a profound way and I sincerely recommend it to others.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
The Road to Divadom	Have you ever felt like the third wheel?  Margaret Drew has spent her entire life as just that.  Tiffany Lane and Chantel Hollis have been Margaret's \\"friends\\" since they were in diapers.  In elementary school, Tiffany and Chantel were the girls everyone wanted to be friends with and by high school the two were the girls of every boy's dreams.  As women, men loved them and women loved to hate them but no one would question their status as true divas.  Margaret has always been relegated to the shadows; she was more of a \\"plain Jane\\" that was outshined by her diva friends.  As adults, Tiffany and Chantel have dream jobs, fancy cars, even fancier wardrobes and men that would make most women salivate.  Margaret has an average job and secretly dreams to become a writer.  She sports payless shoes, \\"sale rack\\" clothes and a serious inferiority complex.  The three women get together for their regular lunch date, and the idea of a European vacation comes up.  Margaret immediately begins to mentally scramble, trying to figure out how she could afford such a costly trip, that is until it becomes apparent that Tiffany and Chantel plan to go without her.  To make matters worse, they expect Margaret to house and pet sit while they are away.<br />Initially, Margaret is disappointed.  But when she realizes that she will have access to all of Chantel and Tiffany's belongings she soon devises a plan to learn the secrets of becoming a diva.  She figures that while her friends are traveling in Europe, she can reinvent herself and no longer be relegated to the shadows.  After just a little snooping, Margaret learns of a secret society of divas; complete with handbooks and training videos.  It becomes her mission to find and absorb the videos and handbooks because she is convinced that they hold the secrets she needs to complete her transformation.  With this, the story begins, and between Margaret's antics and her wry sense of humor and sarcasm, Donna Hill has crafted a tale that is sure to keep you in stitches.  Filled with action and more than a few surprises DIVA'S INC. is the perfect summer read.

One Second Before	Ms. Vida M. Gaynor, Ph.D, is a phenomenal woman with an unwavering faith. Even now in her late 70's, she is eagerly awaiting for life's next assignment to bless her life. Gaynor's autobiography 11:59:59...MIRACULOUS DELIVERANCES AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT, proudly chronicles her life with all its mishaps and obstacles, and her ability to conquer and withstand through it all.<br />From abandonment by her father to the emotional shut down of her marriage, Ms. Gaynor learned at a young age that life was not always fair, and the ones closest often disappoint us the most. She overcame every obstacle thrown in her path, and when a door shut in her face with seemingly no where else to turn, God would always open a window. She called these constant occurences in her life miracles. Gaynor's connection with the spirit realm was evident even at a young age, and her curiosity and thirst for knowledge of the unknown only strengthened this bond. She believed in numerology, astrology, reincarnation or past lives, and the &quot;knowing and seeing&quot; beyond the physical world. Ms. Gaynor's unwavering belief in the power of God within us that sustains and protects, bringing an inner sense of joy and peace no matter the outside circumstances, took precedence over any metaphysics.<br />Her personal memoirs also gives us a glimpse behind the scenes of the turbulent Civil Rights Movement. Furthermore, Ms. Gaynor shares with us some of her personal relationships with the movement's most prominent icons, such as Malcolm X, Betty Shabazz, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. She also was an active member of the Congress of Racial Equality's (CORE) and Black Women Enraged (BWE), which protested the Vietnam War. Ms. Gaynor's destiny also took her half way across the world to East Africa, where she became the country's first female accountant. When she had nothing left to do there, she returned home to the United States. At the age of 50, she entered graduate school. When most people her age are retiring and settling down, she was just getting started! Amazing!<br />11:59:59 is not just another autobiography, but a look into one woman's life who made a difference. After reading this book, I came away with a renewed understanding that everything we need-in spite of our circumstances, fears, or obstacles-is within us and with us every step we take in life.

Reflections	'Mirror, mirror on the wall whose the fairest of them all?'  This is a question Jordan Overton would never ask because she knows she would not be the answer. Jordan lives a miserable life, in a dead-end job, with a boss that treats her like a doormat. She is overweight, has low self-esteem, and she's pining away for a married man who won't give her the time of day.<br />When Jordan undergoes a makeover she starts to see the world through new eyes, and finally the married man of her dreams seems to notice her. Unfortunately,  all of this coincides with a series of strange and violent events: the murder of her boss, people acting strangely and disappearing. Things become more complicated when she finds herself unwittingly entangled in a murder plot and she doesn't know why.<br />Love has blinded Jordan to reality, and somewhere along the line she has lost herself. Jordan loses what little self-respect she has when she realizes she's given her control to this man. Will Jordan come to her senses? For this answer you'll need to read Laurel Handfield's sophomore novel, MIRROR, MIRROR. As a reader I desperately wanted Jordan to improve her opinion and to love herself. Unfortunately,the character development fell short and a lot of questions were left unanswered. However, the story was full of action and never dragged.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

In BLACK: A CELEBRATION OF A<br />CULTURE, she has compiled over 500 photographs vividly displaying<br />African-Americans in all areas of life to include:  fashion, sports,<br />worship, with family, and more.  It is a wonderful collection that<br />showcases the beauty, success, and the societal place African-<br />Americans have carved for themselves in a country in which we weren't<br />really invited.<br />Not only does it show the images that we're familiar with in the<br />history of our race, but it also shows those common moments of<br />everyday things validating the famous saying, &quot;pictures are worth a<br />thousand words.&quot;  It is a reflection of our lives and one of the most<br />rewarding ways of recording ones memories.  There's something to<br />represent everyone and everything of our past and present: from<br />little boys playing sports, to little girls in Sunday dresses and<br />jumping rope and further back in times of civil rights<br />demonstrations, in the cotton fields, and back to the present<br />spotlighting weekends hanging out with the family.<br />There's nothing missing in this brilliant and beautiful collector's<br />item.  The rich culture displayed in this book is one that should be<br />shared by everyone and one that each of us should mimic in our own<br />families, through our photo albums, scrapbooks, or other honorary<br />spots we've made for archiving our bloodline.

Judgment Day	Chris, a single mother, is somewhat inexperienced when it comes to lesbian relationships, but after accepting her attraction towards women, she places a personal ad.  Gayle has vowed that she will never date a woman with children, but after responding to Chris' personal ad, she can't resist pursuing a relationship.  Both women have volatile tempers and a lot of emotional baggage; as a result their relationship is tumultuous at best.  Through the course of the book the author fluctuates between the past and the present, we learn about past hurts and present drama, and the result is a captivating and emotional read about two women searching for love.

There were times when the story had sequencing issues.  One chapter would end and suddenly I would find myself reading about different times, places and characters and it would take a few moments for me to get oriented.  I would have enjoyed the story more had there been smoother transitions between the various storylines and time periods.  Laurinda Brown does an excellent job developing Chris and Gayle as characters, I knew enough about their pasts to empathize with and understand their actions. Their transformation was dramatic, yet believable.  This story is about the spiritual challenges and growth of Chris and Gayle, yet the strong Christian messages don't become apparent until the end of the book.  I really enjoyed this because it allowed the lives of the characters and their search for meaning, purpose, and happiness to illustrate the spiritual themes rather than being preachy.  The author addresses any number of issues in the story including: child sexual abuse, dead beat fathers, domestic violence, sexuality, and religion.  Even if you don't agree with the author's moral stances, you can't help but appreciate her execution of the story in this regard.  One of the greatest messages I took from the book is that God's love is unconditional and omnipresent, even when we try to ignore it.<br />(...)h the author's moral stances, you can't help but appreciate her execution of the story in this regard.

The Geek and The Playboy	Shari Jarod is a true computer geek who spends countless hours in her office pounding away at her keyboard, and the majority of her off-time is spent preparing for the next day. She is an attractive woman, but she hides her beauty beneath shapeless, baggy clothes. Because of a past betrayal by someone she once trusted, Shari does not want to evoke anyone's interest. It also causes her to question whether she can afford to take another chance at love.<br />Emmanuel Jones is the \\"Playboy of Nottoway, Virginia.\\" He's a skilled detective, but when it comes to romance he is missing a few necessary facts; he continually leaves broken hearts and a trail of hurt. He knows what he wants, but the cocky male side of him pushes him to experience as many women as possible.<br />Shari and Emmanuel are fortunate to have meddling siblings who think they would be perfect for each other. At a charity bachelor auction Emmanuel is purchased as Shari's date. They are not pleased, because he doesn't want to date a geek and she is not excited about dating a playboy, but neither is prepared for the sparks they produce. Will their preconceived notions cause them to miss out on the person of their dreams?<br />In THE LAST DANCE readers get to experience a taste of romance southern style. The adage 'You can't judge a book by it's cover' is alive and well as Candace Poarch shows these characters what can be gained when you look beyond the surface. This is a warm fuzzy kind of read.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Mother & Child and Endearing Love	First off, I absolutely loved the concept of having a story written in both English and Spanish and commend the authors on such an undertaking.  EVEN MORE is a beautiful tribute to the unconditional love of mothers and children everywhere and focuses on growing up.  Starting with the birth of a child, we then follow each of the various stages of growth with the mother sharing her love for her child and the child in turn sharing their thoughts about their mother in cute little \\"I love you more\\" phrases.<br />Matched with the declarations of love are sketchings, drawings, and images depicting the child's growth to coincide with the words of the story.  There are even pictures that appear to have been drawn by a child.  Though I loved the book in its entirety, my favorite part comes at the end where the daughter has had her own child and is repeating the cycle of \\"I love you more.\\"<br />Beautiful, colorful, and spotlighting endearing love, this story touched my heart and made me think of my deceased mother as well as my own daughter who I too love...even more.<br />Reviewed by (...)	2004-06-26
Circle of Life	Imagine waking up each day with the knowledge that your father killed your mother. Then imagine trying to understand why he did it and why he's suddenly vanished from your life, leaving you alone. When Thandisha and her younger brother Khalid are forced to live with a grandmother who despises her because she resembles her mother, Thandisha is devastated. Losing both parents in one tragic moment has altered the course of both of their lives.<br />Thandisha feels she and Khalid were never allowed to properly grieve the loss of their parents and their once happy family. They were forced to internalize their feelings, and everything festered inside. To deal with her feelings Thandisha turns to outside forces for support and love. While still in high school she falls victim to the fate of so many young girls, she misdirects her affection and becomes pregnant. Her boyfriend stands by her and wants to have a family, but the hurt from her past begins to haunt her. Thandisha falls into the deep abyss of drug addiction, which ends up costing her the things most precious to her. She wants to be whole again, but is she strong enough to overcome life's obstacles or will she continue to surrender to the mercy of drugs?<br />360 DEGREES...LIFE IS A FULL CIRCLE is a heartbreaking, engrossing and sometimes disturbing novel that shares deep insight into the repercussions after a family tragedy. The story kept me riveted and made me aware of how fragile the human mind is. However, numerous grammatical errors detracted from the storyline and impacted my focus. Regina Neequaye tells a good story, and with her emotional writing style she pulls readers in. I feel that with superior editing she can only get better.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Encouraging and Uplifting	Felix Alexander is a minister, motivational speaker, author and poet who presents to readers a collection of inspirational and motivational poems in his book TO KNOW HIM.  Through the pages of this short collection, he encourages, guides, and emphasizes that while life is indeed a journey of various trials and tribulations, it is also a time of peace and rejoicing for the blessings bestowed upon us and the knowledge that God watches over us.<br />TO KNOW HIM gives testament to the security we can find in God's love and is written in a manner that is encouraging and uplifting.  One of my favorite poems was &quot;Do You Really Expect&quot; which speaks to treating others how we want to be treated and accepting our misgivings and correcting them.  Another favorite was &quot;Look in the Mirror&quot; which encourages us to strive to be the person God wants us to be.  What I really enjoyed about the pieces was that Alexander chose to include scriptures after each poem giving a combined effect of educating and enlightening the reader.<br />This is a wonderful devotional and testament of God's love and would be great to use in Bible study or for at-home sessions of studying the Bible.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Finding What Matters	In WHAT MATTERS MOST, Renita Weems takes an in-depth look at the Song of Solomon from the Old Testament of the Bible.  Early on, she notes that this particular book is unique in several ways; it is essentially made up of love poems that might be considered by some to be bordering on erotic and God is never explicitly mentioned. Another important way in which the Song of Solomon is unique is the fact that it is the only book of the Bible that is predominantly told from a woman's point of view.  Like many other women in the Bible, we don't learn a lot of biographical information about the Shulammite who narrates most of the Song of Solomon.  Weems argues however, that the poetry itself provides us with enough information to know that this unnamed Shulammite woman is one of the earliest examples of a strong, black, Christian woman.<br />Aside from providing the history, background, and controversy surrounding the various interpretations of the Song of Solomon, the author uses the personality characteristics she derived about the Shulammite woman to create a blue print for women of color.  This blueprint will help women learn to love themselves more fully and to truly take to heart the things that should matter most in life.  She argues that as women, so often we get so caught up in helping other people and being what they need us to be that we neglect our individual need to grow and thrive.  She goes on to note that in order to be open to the love that God has for us we must be willing to break the mold, shatter stereotypes, and embrace all aspects of ourselves.  She covers such subjects as identity, balance, sexuality, body image and overcoming adversity, using the Song of Solomon and her own experiences to illustrate her key points.  At the end of each chapter she poses questions for self-reflection which she encourages readers to write about on their own.<br />This is the kind of book that will make you think.  I found myself thinking \\"Wow! I do that all the time!\\"  While I may not agree with all of her reasoning, I enjoyed the fact that it challenged me both mentally and spiritually.  This book would be an excellent book to discuss as a group and is sure to incite some heated debates.

The Heart of a Man	Raised by a single mom, William McCall was always taught to respect women, treat them as queens, and to not be afraid to show his emotions.  When he steps into the dating scene as a sensitive, caring brother, either his masculinity is questioned, or he's used and abused.<br /><br />Alternating between the present and the past, in an easy to read fashion, we experience the highs and lows of William's life.  His past includes Andrea, a woman he meets in a club to whom he is immediately attracted.  Although she has a boyfriend, William doggedly pursues her in hopes that he will become the number one man in her life.  Their on again, off again relationship is tumultous, to say the least, and one which affects all of William's future relationships, including his current relationship with Della.  Della loves William exactly as he is, but when he screws up royally, she kicks him to the curb.  After being unceremoniously and embarassingly dumped, William has a chance to reflect over his life which prompts him to takes steps to change it for the better.<br /><br />SIX DAYS IN JANUARY is an engrossing tale that delves deep into the heart of a man.  Cooper has shown us that, although they don't show it, men have feelings too.  They cry and they hurt, just like women, when matters of the heart are involved.  It was refreshing to see a brother who wasn't all thugged out, or a playa whose only goal in life is to bed as many women as possible.  I was so into this book, there were many times that I wanted to reach in and slap the character William for his emotional blindness where Andrea was concerned.  But then I had to stop and catch myself, realizing that once upon a time that was me, and that love causes people to do crazy things.  The book ended before I wanted it to, leaving me hanging, but eagerly anticipating the sequel.  Kudos to the author on a wonderful debut novel!<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Scarred	THE DEW BREAKER is a collection of vignettes featuring characters whose lives intersect mostly as a result of fate.  At the heart of the story is a nameless man who is known as \\"The Dew Breaker.\\"  Early in the book his daughter, unaware of his torrid past, creates a sculpture in honor of her father, a Haitian immigrant now working in the U.S. as a successful barber.  He carries a menacing scar on his face which is only a superficial representation of his inner turmoil and his unsavory past life in Haiti.  Subsequent vignettes provide additional information about \\"The Dew breaker\\" from the perspective of his wife, neighbors, boarders and others.  With each vignette another layer of this story and the main character's past is uncovered.  The ending, while satisfying in a sense, will leave you to consider the moral imperatives that are presented and come to your own conclusions.<br />Danticat takes us on a series of highs and lows while traveling back and forth through time, from Haiti to the U.S and back. Ultimately, she leaves it up to readers to decide whether the main character is remorseful and seeking redemption or happily basking in the fact that he has gotten away with heinous crimes.  While fate is often the impetus that brings the characters together, each of the vignettes and characters ultimately fit together in a synthesis that is both realistic and believable.  This is a book filled with intricate nuances and minute complexities that, if overlooked, will prevent some from fully grasping and appreciating this fine work.  It is complex, thoughtful, and sure to become a timeless classic.<br />Edwidge Danticat has done it again.  She presents a complex and multi-faceted character driven story that includes keenly executed and descriptive prose.  From the first page I was drawn into the story and felt as if I was experiencing things right along with the characters.  She provides a well-rounded and empathic look at the varied experiences of some Haitian and Haitian American people.

New Difficulties Emerge	The Shenandoah Sisters Series continues with TOGETHER IS ALL WE NEED.  In this collection of books two young girls, Katie and Mayme, have found themselves alone and left to run Katie's family plantation.  Along the way, the two forge an unlikely friendship that transcends racial lines and defies the social mores of the time.  The story opens when a new uncle, Burchard Clairborne, comes to town.  Uncle Burchard is Katie's father's brother, and he feels he is next in line to inherit the family plantation.  Initially, Katie and Mayme continue their attempts to maintain the secret they share, the fact that they live alone.  But Uncle Burchard's persistence and overall lack of sensitivity, eventually leads to the uncovering of the very thing they have worked so hard to hide.  He begins an aggressive mission to take over the plantation and make it profitable for him and along the way he decides that everyone living there with the exception of his niece must find a new home.  The girls become the talk of the town and experience first hand the disdain of the neighbors for both their deception and their unconventional inter-racial friendship.  Things look bleak until yet another uncle, Ward Daniels, appears with some shocking news, just in the nick of time.  From there, the unlikely \\"family\\" works to reunite with Katie's Uncle Templeton and build a new life together.<br />TOGETHER IS ALL WE NEED continues to meet expectations for fans of the Shenandoah Girls Series.  There is drama, controversy, and difficulties but ultimately the love shared among the primary characters helps them survive.  Michael Phillips does a great job capturing the spirit of the time period by providing well rounded characters that are much more complex than the archetypal post-civil war personas quite often presented in literature.  In this book the characters, particularly the former slaves, overtly struggle to reconcile their previous notions of their societal role with the racial equality they share on this \\"color blind\\" plantation.  The dynamic characters, subtle spiritual messages and well-paced plot make this a fulfilling and enjoyable page turner.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersre on this \\"color blind\\" plantation.

Outside Influences	Life as a single mother is a challenging and difficult task for Shawanda Matthews. Trying to balance motherhood and a relationship is proving to be a daunting task. Aaron, her new love, treats her like a queen and helps out with her finances, he seems to be the perfect man. Unfortunately, Aaron's perfection fades when it comes to Shawanda's son. Whenever her son disobeys Aaron all hell breaks loose. One particular night things go too far and Aaron inflicts bodily harm on this four-year-old child. Social Services becomes involved and Shawanda must face a heart-wrenching decision; she has to choose her boyfriend or her son.<br />Shawanda's case is assigned to social worker Margaret Holmes. When she crosses paths with Shawanda she exercises compassion and prays Shawanda will realize her child is the most important thing. Often overzealous in her work, Margaret's professional dedication leaves little time for socializing. She is receiving pressure from her best friend, who is her mother, to settle down and start a family. Her mother's pressures often make her feel less than a woman.<br />CLING TO ME by Gail Marie Mitchell is the story of two women who seem to let others rule their lives, and because of that both are tremendously unhappy. The book starts out very fast paced, and I thought that it would be a very quick read, but that was not the case. I often got tired of Shawanda's whining and Margaret's pity parties. I thought that over the course of the story, their characters would grow, but they never did. However, Ms. Mitchell tells the story in a way that held my interest, and she writes her secondary characters well, but I feel that better development of her primary characters will improve her literary offerings.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Taking Care of Business	The second in the Shenandoah Girls series, A DAY TO PICK YOUR OWN COTTON continues the story of Katie and Mayme.  In this book the two unlikely friends, one a recently freed slave and the other the daughter of a former wealthy slave owner, continue to attempt to keep the fact that they are alone on Katie's plantation a secret.  The two girls struggle to make things look \\"normal\\" on the plantation, but along the way they encounter new friends, a new roommate, dangerous visitors and financial difficulties.  The story has a little of everything, there are moments that are light-hearted and humorous, others that are sad, and some that are filled with suspense, and the result is an overall enjoyable read.<br />While A DAY TO PICK YOUR OWN COTTON is book two in a series, the author provides enough background so that it could stand on its own.  However, I think I enjoyed the book more having read the first because I had a stronger emotional connection to the main characters.  Overall, this is a fast paced story that highlights many aspects of everyday life in the Post-Civil War South.  The Christian themes in the book are subtle and unassuming, it was touching to watch Mayme and Katie struggle to understand God and develop a relationship with him.  While this series is not specifically geared towards young adults I think they may enjoy it as much as their parents.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Behind an Epidemic	Imagine a place where the truth is hidden behind lies, where the natives are kept in the dark regarding what's going on in their midst, and a place where there isn't much in terms of material possessions but the people still maintain a sense of pride and accomplishment in what they do.  Having spent a couple of years in sub-Saharan Africa volunteering with her husband, author Ruth Linnea Whitney pulls from her experience to paint a vivid picture surrounding the AIDS epidemic, known as Slim, and the voices behind the statistics of a small fictional African country and presents it to us in her debut novel, SLIM.<br />Set in late October 1985, the AIDS virus slowly spreads over the tiny country of Kivwe Zandu, Africa.  And though not a real country, it is one that could easily mirror those in real life: with dictatorships, a particular culture in which women don't have much say so, and westerners who have come to lend a hand; to make society better for those who live there.  In addition is the ignorance of those in power and their inability to focus on the disease that claims the lives of their friends, family, and neighbors.<br /><br /> We are introduced to SLIM by a myriad of characters telling this story through their own viewpoint, with ages ranging from young to old, and hearing from the wise to unwise.<br />While SLIM focuses around the discovery and needed treatment of AIDS, Ms. Whitney has also touched on the power, love, and friendship and the sometimes bad turn of events we encounter in our relationships; whether intimate or not.  Her portrayal of the different cultures coupled with the dialogue make this novel one which has to be read slowly, in silence, or one will risk the ability to grasp the tragic, yet loving tone surrounding SLIM.  I found myself complaining about how slow the book was, but can now appreciate the need to read it slowly.  The quirks of the people, the land, and the dialogue all combine for a powerful story...one I would recommend to others.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Angels Come In Many Forms	ANGELS WATCHING OVER ME is the first book in the Shenandoah Sisters series written by the acclaimed Christian author Michael Phillips.  This book introduces us to Mary Ann Jukes (Mayme) and Kathleen Clairborne (Katie); two young girls close in age but with very different lives.  Mayme is a young slave girl living on a plantation in North Carolina.  Through her experiences readers are exposed to the everyday life of a young slave and her family.  Katie lives on another large plantation in the area and lives a comfortable life as the youngest and only daughter of slave owners.<br />The book opens during the turbulent times preceding the civil war.  As the story continues, Katie's life is shaken up when her father and three older brothers go off to fight with the Confederate Army.  Things seem to be going from bad to worse, but as the war comes to a close things start looking up for the Clairborne family.  That is until a violent and tragic series of events take place and life on both plantations is forever changed.  As a result of these events, the paths of these two very different young girls cross and the story of their relationship unfolds.  Katie is a dreamer, but the realities of life are forcing her to grow up fast.  Mayme has always had a hard life and as a result she seems to be afraid to dream at all.  Although the two girls have seemingly opposite worldviews, they are the perfect compliment for one another as they face the difficult challenges that lie ahead.  Along the way the two girls begin to develop a personal relationship with God.<br />Some readers will be turned off by Mayme's acceptance of her role as slave.  In spite of her youth, she has had enough experiences to break her spirit to the point where she is afraid to hope for more.  Katie's hopefulness can in part be attributed to the fact that she is naïve and comes from a privileged background.  Through the story readers are taken on a journey during which the two learn about the harsh realities of life, slavery, God, and one another's culture.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersof life, slavery, God, and one another's culture.  <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay <BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-26
Questionable	Okay, okay, I'll admit it!  The title alone made me want me to snatch this book up and get ready to walk into the secret world of men and what they really want.  And yep, I was a wee bit curious about \\"controlling\\" them too or actually finding out what the author meant by control.  In starting, my biggest question was \\"Why would a man let us in the club, giving us full access to truly run things?\\"<br />First of all, the author did a very good job of starting the book off with a definition of control as \\"a woman's ability to get the things she wants from a man.\\"  Just the title alone seems manipulative and I wasn't really sure this was the type of book I wanted to be caught reading.  After defining control, C. E. Cost jumps straight into the secrets of treating men inconsistently (which I read as being manipulative and playing games), instructions on how to sex your man up (even if you had to fake your own satisfaction--oh and you can't move in some positions so you don't throw off your partner's rhythm), and a few of the vanity issues revolving around a woman's appearance.  While some of the things made me raise an eyebrow a time or two, most of them just made me continue to ask myself if that's what men really want.<br />THE SECRETS:  HOW TO CONTROL A MAN is intended to be a step-by-step instructional guide that covers the gamut of interactions between men and women, but I didn't really get that feel for it.  I saw the first half more as one person's trip down memory lane and all the things his women did to pleasure him, keep him happy, and pump up his ego.  Perhaps this is because the book starts off with tip after tip on things that relate to the sexual gratification of men (and sometimes at a woman's expense) and not until over half-way through the book did the things such as being trustworthy, understanding, honest, respecting your man, and things of this nature come to the forefront.  I felt that the \\"secrets\\" should've been used as a tool to bring men and women closer together, but instead came across to me as a self-serving tool for men to have their sexual desires fulfilled and then after that was accomplished, all of the other stuff (that most women deem as important) could take place.<br />With an editor to revise the format of the book, sequence,  typographical errors, and some of the crude language (appropriate in some places/inappropriate in others), I do think this book could be very well received by both men and women; especially those who are looking for the complete package in their relationship; not just a how-to sex manual.<br />(...)women closer together, but instead came across to me as a self-serving tool for men to have their sexual desires fulfilled and then after that was accomplished, all of the other stuff (that most women deem as important) could take place.<br />With an editor to revise the format of the book, sequence,  typographical errors, and some of the crude language (appropriate in some places/inappropriate in others), I do think this book could be very well received by both men and women; especially those who are looking for the complete package in their relationship; not just a how-to sex manual.<br />(...)	2004-06-26

She's hid herself under a shroud of frumpy clothing and refused to let anyone get close to her.  When she receives a letter filled with obituaries and clues detailing several murders, she knows her past is back to haunt her and takes the information to the police.  Unfortunately, they don't really believe her and why a killer would single her out leaving her clues that she claims only she can see.<br />Reporter/Journalist Gabriel Moss, on the other hand, is sure that her story of the ABC Murders will save his dying newspaper.  Thrusting himself in her life, he immediately sees through her charade and wants to find out what she's hiding.

Made in His Image	Many adults struggle with the concept of God and what it really means to be made in His image.  In AUNT RUBY, DO I LOOK LIKE GOD?, a young girl named Bria struggles to understand this very concept.  Bria has a special relationship with her Aunt Ruby, they share a special tradition of spending each Friday together.  The two obviously share a lot of love and trust.  As a result of this relationship, Bria feels comfortable enough to ask her aunt what on the surface seems to be a simple question, \\"Do I look like God?\\"  Aunt Ruby struggles to find an answer that satisfies Bria, partly because she is unsure of what the answer is herself.  Together, the two of them discuss the question and turn to the Bible for the answers they are seeking.<br />This is a truly heart-warming book and the cool, muted drawings add to this sense of warmth.  The book is a wonderful resource for Christian parents and can serve as a starting point for helping children understand more about God.  What is most charming about the story is the simplicity of its theme: a thoughtful young girl trying to get a clearer understanding of God.

Small Packages...	Once a month the four members of the Somebody Holla! Book Club have a sleep over where they read aloud, laugh and giggle all night, get into each other's business, and have a good time. The thirty-year-old-plus friends are from different backgrounds and lifestyles, and at times they almost come to blows, but in the end they show true sisterhood. Their current selection is an erotic tale by a new author, filled with sex scene after sex scene in which the heroine comes out of a year long self-imposed celibacy. Between scenes of the tale, the members of the book club commented.<br /><br />In SMALL PACKAGES, Sydney Molare did an excellent job of writing two separate stories intertwined within one book. She literally had two books going at once, and her transitions between the two were flawless and timed perfectly.<br /><br />Story-wise, instead of moving forward, the first fourteen pages or so are filled with history about the members of the book club then the history of the heroine of the novel they were reading. It would have been more interesting if the histories were revealed throughout the storylines. In addition, the characters were not believable. For example, one of the book club members was a rich trust fund baby, had been married four times, read books by Zane and Eric Jerome Dickey, and had worked part-time for her father while growing up. Yet she was shocked by almost every sex act in the book like she'd never heard of such activity. The part that put it over the edge for me was she thought the work week was 15 hours.<br /><br />Along with the weak plots and lack of character development, there was a punctuation issue, making SMALL PACKAGES a difficult read. One of the friends, Trina, actually had an interesting subplot that I wish had been developed fully and dispersed throughout the book to help change the pace and make this a more enjoyable read.  Trina had suffered a horrible trauma as a child. It would've been nice to see these \\"friends\\" put down the book and find out why Trina was acting so hateful, and then help her begin the healing process.<br /><br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersfind out why Trina was acting so hateful, and then help her begin the healing process. <BR> <BR>Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey <BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Spirited Account of a Historical Neighborhood	SPIRIT OF HARLEM:  A Portrait of America's Most Exciting Neighborhood<br />by Craig Marberry and Michael Cunningham is a beautiful book filled with two page pictorial accounts of famous and not so famous people and places that make up Harlem USA.  Places such as the famed Abyssinian Baptist Church, the Harlem Hospital, to the Harlem YMCA, the Dance Theatre of Harlem to Hats by Bunn. It also serves as a historical account because the author and photographer delve into the heart and soul of Harlem's past that made it the elite capital it was for African-Americans during the Harlem Renaissance.  SPIRIT OF HARLEM opens with a foreword by Gordon Parks, which sets the tone for this collection, and is followed by the author and photographer's insight into their first glance of Harlem.  This collection of narrations also provides a sequencing of accounts by current and former residents of all ages and nationalities with candid black and white photographs of the subjects highlighted.  Most photographs include a building, which serves as a backdrop or a tangible item that is featured in the story that follows. The first person accounts are encouraging, heartfelt and humorous as well as dismal and oppressive.<br />SPIRIT OF HARLEM showcases traditional and non-traditional professions such as a former activist, an art dealer, artists, a bookstore owner, a chess player, Chief Executive Officers, a choreographer, a nun, an opera singer, a real estate broker and a social worker. Other professions include a fencer, funeral parlor owners, an Asian gospel singer, a Caucasian graphic designer, hair braiders, historians, a journalist, a literary agent, a law firm partner, medical doctors, ministers and church deacon, a photographer, a restaurant owner and spa owners, along with a myriad of other professions.<br />One of my favorite narrations is by Isabel Powell, the first wife of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.  The former Mrs. Powell tells a humorous short story of their meeting, her occupation, his father's rejection of her and finally, her feelings upon their divorce.  Another is Kevin Taylor, a producer for Black Entertainment Television and his recollection of the Harlem Shake, a gyrating dance that took the teens of Harlem and the country by storm.  Finally, Ron Clark, a Caucasian, southern, male teacher who moved from the South to teach in Harlem; his tactics for winning parental involvement and the buy-in from his students.<br />Some people have a distorted perception of this island within an island but SPIRIT OF HARLEM validates the fact that historically and currently there is much to see, do and learn about Harlem.

The Edge of Midnight	Sarita Grayson is the head of a seriously broken down, yet vitally needed, community center. Unfortunately, the property the center sits on is slated to be auctioned off by the city in a few days. It doesn't matter if the final price is seventeen thousand dollars or seventeen cents, Sarita doesn't have it. She has already poured what little money she has into the center and called in all of her favors. Seeing no alternative, she makes a deal with the devil, actually a gang banger, to save the center.<br />Mykal Chandler is the head of a covert government agency that is working to eradicate the illegal drug industry in Detroit. He's preparing a sting when he catches a mysterious woman, Sarita, in the middle of stealing the diamonds from his target. He's attracted to her beauty and her fire, but he has a job to do. One thing leads to another, and bullets fly, leaving Mykal with a superficial wound. No one gets the best of Mykal Chandler--no matter how intelligent, how beautiful, or how intriguing.<br />In THE EDGE OF MIDNIGHT, Beverly Jenkins has done a masterful job of stepping out of the world of historical romance and into the world of contemporary romance.  From the first shot, Ms. Jenkins jumpstarts the romance between Mykal and Sarita then captivates the reader by building on the suspense, sensuality and sexual tension. She definitely has another winner on her hands.<br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Find your glass slippers	Serita Ann Jakes found healing by writing letters to the Lord. And since<br />that deliverance, her heart has been overflowing with the desire to<br />reveal how He has been her Secret Keeper. It is her hope that women<br />who read her story will also learn to trust their secrets to Him.<br />Mrs. Jakes gloriously parallels her message with the famed fairy tale<br />Cinderella. Every woman was born to be a princess, our Creator designed<br />His daughters to be the glory of men and the mothers of all living things.<br />We were the final touch of creation and the solution to loneliness in<br />mankind. So, she asks, &quot;why have so many women have fallen from that place<br />of honor and esteem?&quot; In her comparison to the fairy tale, she urges women<br />to take control of their lives. To not wait for someone to give them a ride<br />to the celebration, but find their own way to the dance as Cinderella did.<br />There are critics who say that life is not like fairy tales with happy<br />endings, but Mrs. Jakes responds, &quot;just as a prince awaited Cinderella, a<br />Prince of Peace awaits you.&quot; It is time for women to be restored to the<br />place of honor that God intended for them to have. THE PRINCESS WITHIN<br />confirms and restores with scripture and reverence.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Growing up is hard to do	SLEEPAWAY SCHOOL is a touching memoir of the formidable years of Caverly Stringer.  The reader is taken on an amazing journey as this young boy becomes a young man in a world where color matters and living in poverty is part of one's existence.<br />Caverly's mother, who is unable to take care of a new son, puts both her children into foster care, only to return for them six years later.  By this time, Caverly and his brother Wayne, have been in the foster care system long enough for the harshness to have a profound affect on the two young boys.  In hopes of the family having a better life, their mother moves them into a mostly white suburb.  Caverly becomes a young boy who is brimming with anger, loneliness and the inability to fit in.  With fits of anger often displayed inappropriately, Caverly loses his temper after a school assembly where a classroom of performers is in black face. After his angry outburst, he is sent to Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School, a sleep away school for young boys in crisis.<br />The author, Lee Stringer, entertains us with stories of how he learns to live away from home in a foreign environment with structure and where he realizes how very different he is from everyone.  While in this new environment, he learns much about himself and how cruel the world can be when you are black.  He spends much of his time trying to belong, but the other young boys constantly pick on him.  One particular incident has Caverly placed in a mental ward for observation after he threw a brick at another student.  He proclaims, \\"I just want to be left alone.\\"  From that one statement, the reader understands precisely what he means.  He wants to be able to live his life without others treating him differently.  After an incident involving the use of a racial epitaph, the reader realizes Caverly is slowly starting to grow and mature because he does not react in his usual violent manner.<br />Although at times the story was sad, there were bursts of happiness that the reader reveled in because it becomes obvious that Caverly deserved to be able to smile and enjoy a moment of happiness.  This memoir is a testament into how much young black men must overcome.  The story being told by Caverly moved at a very comfortable pace and the writing style was different but very poignant.  With memorable characters, this novel will make you smile at times, as well feel saddened by this young boy's plight.  I enjoyed this novel for its lyrical writing style and message of hope.

The expressions of life	In MOODSWINGS, Shamora Renee pulls readers into the life of Sandra Deneen Garden.  Sandy, as her friends call her, is a successful 29-year-old who is looking for a man in her life.  On her journey, she encounters several men of questionable character who left her broken in spirit, but still looking, nonetheless.  As a result, she becomes promiscuous, often having one-night stands that rob her of her dignity and a few of her possessions.  Navigating her way through the lies, deceit, and meaningless, one-sided sex, she tells her friends some pretty wild tales, but deep down the truth is slowly eating away at her. When will she ever meet Mr. Right?<br />In this novel, Renee covers such things as sexuality, religion, racism, friendship, and betrayal.  The book has sections that are called courses, which would lead one to infer that a lesson of some sort would ensue.  The courses are interspersed with poems that serve to heighten the reader's awareness of the subject at hand.  Renee alternated between bold and non-bold typeface as well as italic and non-italic so much so that it caused major distractions for me. Much of the stories were written in a style that read as if one was reading from a transcript, which only served to further frustrate me as I tried to understand the point being made.  The poetry, however, added another dimension to this book and, in my opinion, told the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed each piece.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The Reawakening	In A TIME TO REAP, the newest addition to her literary repertoire, Therese Tappouni does a tremendous job in bringing to life the experiences of a woman dealing with the profound emotional pain of losing her firstborn son.  The author uses her literary ingenuity to tackle a somber issue and transform it into a powerfully engaging, poignant tale of healing and recovery.<br />Devastated by the death of her son, Maureen Manley walls up her grief,<br />detaches herself from her troubled life and retreats into an unemotional state of being.  Years later, as her children leave for college, she finds herself going through menopause and descending into a deep abyss of depression and despair.  Just when it seems she has reached her darkest days, she acts on a compulsion to revisit the emotional trauma that had gotten her to where she was, and opens up a box of mementos from the funeral.  At the very bottom of the box she discovers a yet unopened sympathy card which infuses new life into her droll existence.  Acting on this new emotion, she decides to take a trip, which leads to a spiritual reawakening of sorts, as Maureen finds herself embarking on a mystical odyssey of self-discovery.<br />In this eloquently written, well paced book, Toppouni keeps the reader captivated with her remarkable storytelling ability.  The tale of Maureen's triumph over tragedy and despair is a deeply moving one and speaks to the indomitable spirit that inspires humans to persevere in the face of the worst that life has to offer.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Romance or Mainstream?	What would you do if your ex-husband abducted your young son and you feared you would never see him again?  This is the question that our heroine must answer as she tries to locate her missing son.  After getting fed up with her husband's abuse and problems with alcohol and drugs, special education teacher Kristie Phillips, decides to divorce him.  With her son missing after visitation with his father, Kristie enlists the help of attorney, T. Zan McManus.<br />T. Zan McManus, Zan as he likes to be called, wants to do whatever it takes to help Kristie find her son.  Zan knows all too well what it is like to be abducted and to never see your mother again.  He has a special place in his heart for missing children.  He takes Kristie's case because of his overwhelming need to help her find her son and also, to protect this young woman, who seems to be on the emotional brink.<br />COME BACK TO ME revolves around the search and rescue of Kristie's six-year old son, Curtis.  Zan and Kristie are drawn to each other by a mutual attraction and as they work to find Curtis, a budding romance evolves.  While in Mexico searching for Curtis, the couple succumbs to their mutual attraction and falls in love.<br />COME BACK TO ME is not a typical romance novel; instead it is a story of how devastating it can be to lose a child to a parental abduction. For that reason, the romance is not paramount and rightfully so because of the serious nature of the story.  Since the romance is lost in the bigger picture of child abductions, the reader does not get the chance to be enamored by Zan and Kristie falling in love.  COME BACK TO ME is a well-written story, but it does not fit into the traditional romance genre.<br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
A family tribute	This 25th Anniversary Edition of SPOONBREAD AND STRAWBERRY WINE,<br />is much more than another cook-book of Southern cuisine. It is a tribute<br />to a one-of-a-kind family, told through soul-satisfying memories and<br />recipes; a classic collection of home cooking, remedies and reminiscences.<br />The inspiration for this book evolved from a family history project by<br />sisters Norma Jean and Carole in the late 1970s. After extensive travel<br />they had uncovered rare photographs and forgotten rituals of their<br />family's rich African American heritage, which they used to embellish the<br />recipes.<br />With warmth and animation the sisters introduce the pioneers who inspired<br />this book and their lives. Their grandfather, Papa Darden, a former slave<br />who sold his renowned strawberry wine for five cents a glass in his general<br />store. Aunt Lil, who made what she called tried-and-true homemade beauty<br />cream, and Aunt Maude, who could recall George Washington Carver's peanut<br />butter ice cream. SPOONBREAD AND STRAWBERRY WINE boasts of a rich family<br />history, herbal cures, health and beauty tips, but the centerpiece of<br />this special book is the feast of family recipes.<br />Norma Jean and Carole Darden have produced an event that is heartwarming,<br />fascinating and appetite-pleasing. I urge you to invest in a copy and share<br />a history that is as rich and succulent as the recipes that line the pages.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
It�s My Turn	LOVE'S TWILIGHT by Moody Holiday is the finale of the trilogy of Shanelle, Alex and Derrick.  As the story begins, we find Shanelle reflecting on the murder of her husband Alex, a police officer.  Shanelle takes us back to the days leading up to the bloody killing and questions his integrity and the integrity of others.  As the story unfolds, there is much blame placed and plenty of guilt to go around.<br />Forced to make it on her own, Shanelle is thrown back into a relationship with all the doubts that come from a love lost and found again.  Only this time, she has a son to raise and he is her first priority; her second is finishing her college education.<br />Holiday did a nice job of highlighting Shanelle and her ability to think and make decisions for herself.  In the first book, Wild Innocence, we witness Shanelle's survival from a dysfunctional family.  In the second book, Sweet Redemption, we feel Shanelle's avoidance of her life and the steps she takes to keep the peace, and with LOVE'S TWILIGHT, we get a look at Shanelle finding the love of self and finally trying to come into her own as a woman, mother and widow.  Shanelle's major hurdle is pleasing people other than herself, mainly Alex's family.  Holiday flips the script somewhat and throws in a family secret that appears to answer many questions Shanelle has about her life.<br />As with the first two installments of the trilogy, Holiday showcases her talent as a poet with beautiful, descriptive poems about Shanelle's life, thoughts and hope for the future.  I enjoyed reading Holiday's trilogy of Shanelle Brown Foster because I was able to see her mature from a teenager to a woman with all the bumps, bruises and finally triumph that is expected.  With a thought provoking storyline, descriptive prose, excellent character development and witty dialogue, this is a heartwarming finale to a very good collection.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

The Eyes of the Truth	URBAN WEB TALES by Gregory J. T. Simpson is the second installment of Noah, Micah and Bishop's story. Simpson's first book, Until Death Do Us Part, introduced us to this trio with the focus on Noah and the murder of his wife.  Micah, a government operative, and Bishop, a reformed street thug, were there to assist in finding the murderer.  As URBAN WEB TALES opens, we find Micah seeking release from her government job and entering into private investigations with Bishop. We also find her settling into a quiet life with Noah and his daughter.  But Micah is a magnet for adventure and to quell this need, she takes on a case that involves more entities than she ever imagined.  Set in Atlanta and quickly transferring to the city of New Orleans, Micah and Bishop seek the murderer of Micah's ex-lover's son. As they enter New Orleans, their efforts are further financed by a casino owner and thwarted by the local police department and other thugs.  They soon find out that they are seeking people who are acting out urban web tales or urban legends that have left a trail of dead bodies.  The question becomes, why?<br />Simpson has managed to tell a gripping story with serious social commentaries.<br />While caught up in the action, messages and truths are abundant and compel you to stop and consider the world around us.  Again, poverty, drugs, crime and a new wave of wannabes are highlighted.  Well written, spellbinding and entertaining, (Micah and Bishop are quick with the tongue lashings) URBAN WEB TALES will give you pause to consider our world and the operatives that appear to run it!  This is a very good piece and I look forward to the third episode of Noah, Micah and Bishop.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
African American Musical Culture Revealed	Arthur Kempton takes the reader on a musical journey in his book BOOGALOO.  Beginning with gospel greats such as Thomas Dorsey, moving on to soul crooners such as Sam Cooke, and ending with present day hip hop and rap artists, such as Tupac and DMX, Kempton gives a behind the scene glimpse at the culture, society, and economics that make up \\"Aframerican\\" music.<br />When I first picked up BOOGALOO, I thought that the book would merely be a factual account of the music industry.  While it does encompass that, it is much more.  It gives a candid view of the music industry, primarily the African American side and its impact on American culture.  Although a bit wordy at times, BOOGALOO presents an interesting, accurate, and unique portrayal of an important part of American culture-music.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23

She is beginning a new life as a recent college<br />graduate embarking on a career as an interior designer.  She seems to have<br />everything going for her - looks, a promising career, a supportive family, and<br />a brand new boyfriend, but she's haunted by nightmares from her past.<br />Antoine Billups is Roxy's new boyfriend.  He is a hot new artist who is<br />finally coming into his own.  He loves Roxy fiercely, but senses that she is<br />holding something back from him.  The other part of Antoine's world is shaped<br />by his best friend, Nicky, a loving lesbian who is like a sister to him.<br />Nicky is protective of Antoine and suspects that Roxy is not as great as she<br />seems.  Unfortunately, tragedy strikes Nicky which leaves her unable to<br />protect Antoine from Roxy's hypnotic hold.<br />Bacon and Daniels weave a story that is filled with drama and surprises.  Roxy<br />and Antoine must learn to trust and love one another amidst many past hurts<br />and present traumas.  The story flows well and it's hard to believe that two<br />people wrote it as opposed to one.  The characters are memorable and incite<br />emotion and I often found myself wanting to reach through the pages and have a<br />girl talk with Roxy.  DRAW ME WITH YOUR LOVE is a satisfying and drama-filled<br />read.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Dangerous games	ONE LIFE, NO SEQUEL begins with this reflective paragraph, 'In the final days,<br />there will be many false prophets, because so many people are waiting for<br />their savior. But Kevin Gray believes the only thing that will save him is<br />the dope he is slinging.'<br />Prepared for all the drama that comes with the hustler lifestyle, Kevin is<br />known on the streets of Miami as Ready, and he takes pride in the way he<br />handles his business. This taut, chilling tale of life in the inner-city<br />comes complete with an array of diverse characters who are either hustling<br />or being hustled. As the story unfolds Gainer has juxtaposed the preacher<br />in the pulpit with the crack head on the street with baby mama drama.  No<br />one is above reproach and the lines of friendships and relationships are<br />so broken that loyalty and commitment are lost between the spaces. After<br />being double crossed by his woman, his best friend, and the preacher, Kevin<br />knows his time on the streets is speeding towards a tragic end. A fatal<br />accident leaves a haunting emptiness, and since he cannot rewrite his<br />script he wonders where can he go and what can he do? He no longer feels<br />his dope will save him and he is not ready to die.<br />Michael Gainer has written a graphic depiction of the unprincipled<br />motivation found on the streets of urban America. The writing is intense<br />and the characters are within the range of probability, but I think the<br />author was so intent on sharing the cadence of inner-city life that the<br />story at times took a back seat. ONE LIFE, NO SEQUEL paints a picture of<br />imprisoned lives that scream for release; but no one is listening.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23

Emotional motion	SINGING A TREE INTO DANCE is a special edition Poetry Chapbook in<br />celebration of Jaki Shelton Green, who is the recipient of the 2003<br />North Carolina Governor's Award for Literature. And although the book<br />is only 32 pages and shares 8 poems, the adage `less is more' is very<br />evident.<br />Ms. Green shares a searching exploratory into the emotional senses of<br />readers. The poems, which read like verses from a sultry song, bring to<br />mind the earthiness of Sarah Vaughan or Nina Simone. They are demanding<br />and invigorating as they inspire, even challenge, to reach beyond the<br />surface and allow the mind to lose itself in a deeper introspection.<br />The title alone set my mind to wonder, is the writer implying that the<br />poem's musical outpour should inspire something as rooted as a tree into<br />movement as fluid as dance? Or that much like the leaves of the tree on<br />a windy day, the human spirit be free enough to express a joyous<br />exaltation?

Clearing his name	Allene Carter uncovered the story of an unsung hero and retells it with passion in her book HONORING SERGEANT CARTER. Allene's phone rang  one fateful day, and she was informed that her father-in-law, Eddie Carter, had been denied the Medal of Honor for his bravery in World War II. Eddie was originally awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest military honor, as no black men had been awarded the Medal of Honor during this war. This wrong was to be righted by the Clinton Administration, and Eddie and others would be revered for their service to their country.<br />However, as Allene began rummaging through the remnants of the soldier's life, she discovered a lot more than she expected. It seemed her father-in-law had much more of a story to tell than Allene had ever imagined. Through her tireless efforts and extensive research, Allene Carter rectified the injustices committed against Eddie during his life.<br />This book is much more than the casual recounting of a soldier's story. Instead, it is a glimpse into the world as it was for a black serviceman returning home from war in the 1940's. Though there are countless others who lived a similar experience, the personal aspect of knowing this soldier by name affords a much heavier impact. I applaud Allene Carter for discovering the truth and clearing the name of an innocent victim of a racist era.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Sister Sleuths	WHERE THERE IS A WILL is a collaborative effort by five authors who number among the more creative minds in fiction writing. The themes of the  four stories revolve around the lives of the Chambers sisters who grudgingly return to their small-town home to solve cases willed to them by their recently deceased father, a noted private investigator.  All four tales are distinct in their style and methodology and effectively showcases the writing prowess of each author.<br />\\"Curtains,\\" the first installment is penned by Margie Walker and introduces Maxine, a phenom in the banking world.  In solving her case, Maxine soon discovers she is in for a lot more than she bargained for, in the person of  the local police sergeant Luscious Kimble.  When she narrowly escapes a bullet obviously meant to silence her, the pair's burgeoning attraction becomes imperiled and she finds that Luscious is more than willing to take on the role of  protector.<br />The second story, \\"The Bad Penny,\\" written by Shirley Hailstock, features Taylor, the daughter who is assigned to solve a missing person's case involving child (...) and possible murder.  In  the third story, \\"Identity Crisis,\\"  authored by Bridget Anderson, daughter Samantha matches wits with a cunning impostor set on deceiving his wealthy fiancee and her unsuspecting family.<br />In the final installment, \\"Redemption\\" Shelby Lewis delves into the world of an unstable serial murderer as the oldest daughter Morgan, desperate to stop a killer, finds herself in the midst of a whodunit which may ultimately end up uncovering long dormant family secrets.<br />These prolific writers have pooled their sizable talents to generate an absorbing anthology of mystery and adventure. Each of the stories is  pretty solid for the most part with a nice blend of suspense and intrigue and as in the case of Curtains, a welcome dash of romance.  With believable characters and an engaging storyline, WHERE THERE IS A WILL is an enjoyable read with remarkable appeal.<br />(...)remarkable appeal.<br />(...)	2004-06-23
Producing Godly mature children	In today's world, children are being introduced to sexual immorality at much earlier ages than in the past.  Television, music and the news are filled with sex and have our kids thinking about and preparing to incorporate sex into their lives before many are even mature enough to handle it.  RAISING PURE KIDS IN AN IMPURE WORLD takes a look at a strategy used by Richard and Renee Durfield to guide their children in resisting sexual temptation.  The Durfields use a concept called \\"key talk\\" with their children and others that have come seeking help from the risks of sexual promiscuity.  In the key talk process, parents identify a time in the child's life when it is appropriate to have a one-on-one conversation about sex and the role it was intended to play in our lives. This discussion should be honest and open to cover all aspects of sex and the consequences in pre-marital relationships.  After the talk, a covenant is entered into between the child and God.  As a seal of the covenant the child is given a ring or necklace to wear at all times to symbolize the agreement between themselves and God.<br />The Durfields introduce an interesting approach for parents to consider using as they help their children stave off sexual promiscuity and handle peers that are pressuring them into it.  Key talk is backed by scriptures from the Bible that show God's purpose for matrimony and the pitfalls of sex outside the marriage. The Durfields' guide is chock full of statistics, scriptures and questions with answers to cover just about any situation that parents may face when using this system.  It is adaptable for use by nearly anyone facing issues of sexual purity at any stage in their lives.<br />I was especially impressed with the testimonials by not only the Durfields' kids, but all the other individuals who have used the key talk strategy and how they were able to keep their covenant with God despite the road blocks some faced.  As this conversation with my child is fast approaching, I am now more confident in what I need to do and say as a result of reading this guide. The Durfields should be commended for putting together such a comprehensive and truthful guide.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

A House of Knives and Mirrors	Set in 1970's Harlem, WHEN DID YOU STOP LOVING ME by Veronica Chambers features Angela Davis Brown, a child abandoned by her mother, Melanie, and left to be raised by her father, Teddo, a magician. The story, told through the voice of Angie as an adult, delves into the past as Angie attempts to come to grips with her mother's abandonment.  What we find is Angie's endurance, her hopefulness for her mother's return, her optimism and lack of hatred towards her mother.  Through her musings we are treated to her father's agenda.  Teddo is self-absorbed as he ekes a life for Angie and himself.  He is consumed with race relations, the movement of the time, but only when it benefits the moment and his goals.  Actually this is a story about the pain of abandonment of two people, however, it is through Angie's voice we hear her father's pain as he strives to shield the truth from Angie.  Angie also bears some additional truths, some with humor and some with sadness, of the people they come into contact with such as Teddo's male friends, his female acquaintances, the clients he performs for, his bartering skills and Angie's aunt; an aunt with limited contact prior to Melanie's surrender.<br />Veronica Chamber's prose is excellent and her use of metaphors and similes is fluid and enjoyable to read.  The imagery has the ability to take you to this era and through it as you feel for Angie and her needs as a young girl coming of age.  I enjoyed listening to Angie because of her quipped remarks, replies and thoughts. The ending is heartfelt as Angie, as an adult, continues to question why her mother stopped loving her.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23

Human Cargo	HUMAN TRAFFICKERS by Joe Ike is a high tech thriller that examines the human<br />trade industry.  Ike builds a story that is easy to visualize on the small<br />screen.  The characters and the plot read smoothly and provide technical<br />intrigue rivaling the T.V. shows, CSI and Law and Order.<br />The story opens with an illegal alien falling to her death while trying to<br />cross the U.S. and Mexican border.  This single event sets into motion a<br />massive investigation that uncovers an alien smuggling ring that is as<br />technologically adept as the U.S. Immigration Bureau.  This provides a<br />challenge for agents who always seem to be one step behind the smugglers.<br />Swirled in this mix are ample arrays of characters who are involved in human<br />trafficking for all sorts of reasons.<br />This novel tackles many human rights issues including the illegal smuggling of<br />women for prostitution, sexual harassment, fraud, and internet dating.  The<br />only drawback is there are so many characters that at times it's hard to<br />keep up with the flow of the story.  However, to Ike's credit, he ties the<br />novel up nicely all the while making a statement about the quality of life.<br />HUMAN TRAFFICKERS is a solid book that screams screenplay.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
The Blues....	&quot;The blues - it's kind of like religion, really.&quot; - Peter Green<br />In this companion book to MARTIN SCORSESE PRESENTS THE BLUES: A MUSICAL JOURNEY, a PBS/DVD series, numerous music historians and period writers take on the task of capturing the very essence of the genre that gave birth to rock and roll. Peter Guralnick says in his introduction that the purpose of the companion book was to &quot;reflect and refract the spirit of the blues&quot; and to compile &quot;something deeper and more spiritual than a mere recitation of the facts.&quot;<br />Mainstay blues historians such as Christopher John Farley, Peter Guralnick, Alan Lomax, Paul Trynka, and Robert Gordon have their place in the companion book by contributing their biographical and historical research as well as adding some new information to the blues arsenal. Excerpts from Gordon's CAN'T BE SATISFIED: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MUDDY WATERS and Trynka's PORTRAIT OF THE BLUES are included alongside new entries such as Christopher John Farley's &quot;Bessie Smith: Who Killed the Empress?&quot; Present day fiction writers like Suzan Lori-Parks and Toure also offer their contributions on the blues and the legacy it left behind.<br />While the usual historians are included in the book, there also are many mainstream writers who have come across the blues at times in their lives.  Among others, there are excerpts from Ralph Ellison's acclaimed INVISIBLE MAN, James Baldwin's FIRE NEXT TIME, and Faulkner's SOLDIER'S PAY. All of these pieces relate to the blues within their own context, and the result is a first hand account of how the blues have affected many.<br />The blues is an element of American culture that has spawned the genesis of many things from R&amp;B to rock and roll and everything in between.  Although the televised version of Martin Scorsese's chronicle of this genre is excellent and informative in its own right, this book affords an experience that can only be garnered by turning pages, scrutinizing photos, and reading and re-reading the bottom line, which turns out to be the blues.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersrutinizing photos, and reading and re-reading the bottom line, which turns out to be the blues.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23

Open Doors	Bert Davis, Director of Planning at American Instruments, is a proud Black man who has struggled to make it into the top echelons of corporate America: he marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, he earned his M.B.A, and he has opened many doors in corporate America for Blacks less fortunate than himself. When American Instruments succumbs to a hostile takeover, the last thing Bert needs is for some old shoe-shine man to tell him how to survive the cuts.<br />Hiawatha Jackson, better known as Daddy Big Bucks the shoe-shine man, is a proud Black man who struggled to make it through life: his father was lynched, he earned his advance degree from the street of hard knocks, and he believes Blacks will never make it as a group if they continue fighting for acceptance by corporate America instead of owning their own businesses.  He built his multi-million dollar company from the ground up and wants to reach back and mentor Bert.<br /><br />Mr. Waite did an excellent job at laying out the two different approaches to success the main characters took. He showed pros and cons of each side in a balanced manner, and he uncovered a prejudice many of us have toward those in the service industry. My issue with DADDY BIG BUCKS is that Mr. Waite spent the vast majority of the book explaining the two sides. I felt like the story was on hold while the two main characters got to know each other. DADDY BIG BUCKS was a good book, but if the conflict was introduced earlier, this would have been a more exciting read.<br />Reviewed by Deatri King-Bey<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23

She writes about Josephine's energy and<br />enthusiasm to perform on stage before a live audience.

Listen to your voice�	How does a young, black male learn to listen to the voices of reason when he is living in a world that is against him?  HEARING VOICES, A MEMOIR examines a young boy's life as he becomes a man.  The reader witnesses how he overcomes the setbacks of his life and how he finally learns to listen to his own voice.<br />As a young boy, Nathan Lewis lived in a household where his mother took care of the family, which included him, his younger sister and a stepfather.  The stepfather, the only real father he knew, was a victim of the voices in his head, schizophrenia.  Nathan's strength came from his mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and his aunt.  These women persevered through life's trials and tribulations and were able to live life to its fullest.  However, their strength could not keep Nathan from following the wrong path of gangs, drugs and sex.  As he transitions into a man, Nathan struggles to find himself, come to terms with his biological father abandoning him, and depression.  He learns to use poetry and his search for religion as coping tools.<br />In order for Nathan to grow, he had to learn how to be a man.  After several failures and with the birth of his children, he recognizes his need to find his true self. Nathan begins relying on his own strength to survive and make a prosperous life for his children.<br />HEARING VOICES, A MEMOIR is an interesting story of finding one's self.  I was really engrossed in Nathan's search for a religion.  He studied, he experienced and read about many different religions.  His experiences led him to find that the Christian church was hypocritical.  He eventually turns his back on the church, but he continued to study religion.  Today, he has just ventured back into the church and is taking it one day at a time.  Although the story was a quick read, I found the author only gave us a surface understanding of his life.  I wanted him to delve deeper into the whys of his actions so the reader could have a better understanding of him as a person.  I found the poetry interwoven throughout the story as the real tellers of the truth about his life.

Sexual Testimonies	Take a literary journey with Tricia Rose, author of LONGING TO TELL,<br />and read some revealing, heartbreaking, and inspiring narratives from<br />a host of women of color who talk about sexuality, race, and their<br />coming of age as a woman.<br />Tricia Rose begins by sharing with readers the purpose and reason for<br />this unusual project which opened up doors to allow these unknown and<br />unspoken women of color to tell their stories. The women outlined in<br />the book is of various ages, economic, and educational backgrounds. The extensive research and countless interviews propel this author's thought-provoking narratives from women breaking through a sexuality barrier that has always been unspoken of through generations of people of color.<br />LONGING TO TELL rises to the occasion, orchestrating a context that speaks from the voices of women on their sexual relationships, and intimate clich&eacute;s that thrust many into a naive state of ignorance and misinterpreting the art of intimacy.<br />The women's names were changed along with other details to protect<br />their identity due to some very graphic details in which they<br />outlined their exposure to sexuality. It was a hard lesson for many<br />and a rude awakening for others. They speak on growing up in<br />dysfunctional surroundings, exposure to drugs, and going from one<br />relationship to another.  Several grew up with the pretense that if<br />you had sex it meant love.<br />They explain how their families and children had to endure their<br />unorthodox and self-destructive behaviors that sometimes lead to<br />tragic consequences. One woman speaks of how her young son was<br />beaten to death by her boyfriend, and never realized the warning signs<br />because she stayed in a haze of drugs. They speak candidly about their first sexual encounters with men and women. They speak on where they were and where they are today.  They explain their process of healing along the path to finally taking control of their lives.<br />All the women's narratives speak volumes on the depth and courage that made them survivors. In the end, the author sums up very eloquently the overall dynamics of the sexual ramifications that women of color encounter today.<br />LONGING TO TELL by Tricia Rose is a well written book. Tears came to my eyes several times reading some of the stories, and I wanted to jump into the book and hug and congratulate each woman on revealing their personal journey. I applaud Ms. Rose for her insight and courage to develop, research, and talk with so many women who are sisters, mothers, aunts, wives, and friends offering them an outlet in which to speak. A must read for everyone because knowledge is the key to understanding and awareness.

Do all things in His name�	I thought I had read and seen everything there was to see to on the subject of<br />weight loss.  I have even tried a multitude of plans, which in the end promise<br />the same results with similar methods. Most of these plans and methods will<br />work for a little bit of time, but none of these plans have or promise what<br />FIT FOR GOD does - a relationship with God.  La Vita Weaver brings<br />inspirational energy to a field that is filled with assurances of better<br />health and bodies that often leave people feeling hopeless and like<br />failures.  In FIT FOR GOD, Weaver shares her story of food addiction and how<br />she finally took control of her health.<br />FIT FOR GOD outlines a plan for living that is Biblically based and supported<br />by scientific information.  Weaver marries the weight loss struggle with your<br />personal relationship with God.  She suggests a number of motivational<br />techniques that are designed to let the person grow spiritually while<br />developing better eating and exercise habits.  She presents the plan as an<br />eight week journey which could take longer depending on where you are<br />emotionally in your fitness journey.<br />Although Weaver utilizes some of the basic tools of the trade i.e.,<br />journaling, increasing water intake and exercise, she couples them with<br />biblical scripture that brings new meaning to getting fit. One of the things<br />that make this plan workable is that the author encourages readers to change<br />their view of things.  For example, week two is on increasing water intake.<br />Weaver begins this section by discussing the significance of water in the<br />Bible she then segues into personal anecdotes on how she increased her<br />intake.  She shares that she calls water \\"glory\\" then pointedly asks<br />readers, \\"Have you had your glory today?\\"<br />FIT FOR GOD is weight loss from a Christian perspective that eliminates the<br />hopelessness of failed weight loss methods.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswers	2004-06-23

Through this raw and unabashed account of life in the game, readers are given an up close look at K'Wan's characters and their struggle.<br />Lou-loc, originally a gangster from California, moved to New York City with his close friend and member of his brethren, Gutter.  While in New York, Lou-loc and Gutter take over Harlem's Crip set and become two of the most powerful and feared hustlers roaming the streets of the city. Unlike Gutter, however, Lou-loc has become weary with the life of a hustler.<br />Lou-loc meets Satin, a beautiful, intelligent woman who just happens to be a rival gang leader's sister.  Lou-loc wants out of the game to focus on his writing, but when tragedy strikes, the calm that had been present in Harlem lifts to uncover a gang war and a homicidal vendetta that Lou-loc cannot ignore.<br />I was moved by K'Wan's novel despite the editorial issues that were present.

Spiritual Healing	Victoria A. Eckstein's HALLELUJAH ANYHOW is wonderfully<br />inspirational and will touch anyone seeking answers to the trials<br />and tribulations of life. It is a standing ovation for one<br />woman's heartfelt chronicle of her journey to seek God's<br />guidance and blessings.<br />She begins her story with her parents and their family life that<br />included the physical and mental abuse her mother suffered at the<br />hands of a husband addicted to heroin. This dysfunctional<br />environment was the focus of her upbringing and it took a toll on<br />her and her siblings; they were afraid of their father. With no<br />positive comparisons, Victoria assumed this is what life is all<br />about, and so begins her journey of abusive relationships and<br />marriages.<br />What kept her going was her belief in God, and although she felt God<br />would not put more on her than she could bear, she still felt a<br />serious burden. After two failed marriages and relationships, she<br />felt she would never obtain a wholesome relationship. After<br />experiencing countless abuse, she soon realizes she is becoming her<br />mother.<br />Ms. Eckstein vividly recounts the dramatic incidents that eventually<br />changed her life and she wanted to share her story to inspire others<br />who have had similar situations. She hopes readers will see the<br />depths of her despair, and how God guided her through the tunnel to<br />the \\"light\\" of healing and forgiveness.<br />I commend Victoria A. Eckstein for sharing, HALLELUJAH ANYHOW and<br />making it an inspirational tool for those who are still in that<br />tunnel. As she explains in her book, you don't have to call<br />on and praise God when you're down or up, you should praise Him<br />anytime.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br />Of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Hold the cheesecake�	In an amusing account of life and food, Bill Cosby examines the state of his<br />health and mourns his favorite foods in I AM WHAT I ATE ... AND I'M FRIGHTENED.<br />Cosby talks about turning 65 and becoming aware of his body in ways that he<br />never examined before.  He lightly deals with the ills of aging and how what<br />you can eat changes dramatically as you age.  In a number of anecdotes and<br />stories, he talks about visits to the doctor, aches and pains, cholesterol,<br />and eating in moderation. Presented in classic Cosby style, he exaggerates his<br />life experiences in ways that will have you hollering in laughter.  For<br />example in one chapter he illustrates how young people think they are<br />invincible by telling a story from his youth where he went out to see his<br />girlfriend in 20 degree weather wearing only a thin cotton school jacket.<br />Cosby takes you with him as he waits for the bus and his fingers start to go<br />numb onto the very end when he discovers that he has lost his bus fare. My<br />favorite chapter in the book was on entitled &quot;Moderation&quot;  and Cosby lets you<br />know in a humorous way just how little he knows about it.<br />Cosby keeps his tone light and avoids becoming preachy on a topic that has been<br />dear to him for a long time.  We all remember The Cosby Show and Bill hiding<br />hoagies and other tasty treats.  In this book, he shares a few regrets about<br />the food choices of his past while trying to strike a balance in his current<br />eating habits.  I AM WHAT I ATE...

Are your kids rotten?	Have you taken a really harsh look at the type of kids you are raising lately?  Are you providing the proper environment for them to thrive in?  Are there external forces that could be hampering your progress?  If you're not sure, then take a look at OTHER PEOPLE'S ROTTEN KIDS by Essie P. Knuckle and Mittie P. Glymph.  They have taken an in depth and often humorous look at all those things that can influence a child's healthy development.  The book is divided into three short sections.  Within these sections, parents learn the characteristics and influences on a child's life that can produce rotten kids.  Also, parents are shown how they contribute to their children's character and how negative communities can impact kid's lives.<br />Knuckle and Glymph have written a nice guide for parents that explain how kids get to be rotten kids and how we as parents can deter that behavior.  The authors admit they have not participated in the total rearing process of children themselves, but have used a lot of their clinical experience gained in their work with hospitals, schools and prisons.  A lot of the advice was practical and very easy to use.  I found them to be easily transportable in dealing with children located anywhere.  I did encounter a few editing problems that made the reading a little difficult at times, but I would encourage parents to pick up a copy of this book.  It may help you identify some thing that you are doing that is causing the rotten behavior in your child.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Good versus evil	Since the beginning of time, there has always been a battle between good and evil.  Many of us hope and pray that this battle will eventually be won by good. In FIRE OF GOD, we take a look at the battle as it continues on the planet Augusta a few hundred years into the future.  Satan and his adversaries are bound and determined to take over the galaxy once and for all.  God has other plans as he chooses a leader for His people and empowers him with a ring full of power to fight the forces of evil.<br />Joseph KaRel was born under some very sad circumstances.  His mother died during his birth and he became the instant enemy of his brother Michael, and distant to his father, Governor William KaRel.  William, although saddened by the events that led to him losing his wife, had a job to do.  Leit, an angel of God, told him one of his sons would wear the ring with all Holy power and when the time was right he would know which one.  While battling the forces of evil himself on the planet Augusta, William also had to train his sons to be prepared to take the helm.  He knew deep down the choice would pit brother against brother.<br />When the ring chooses Joseph, Michael turns his back on God to make a pact with Satan.  Joseph enters the fray knowing he must not only fight the forces of evil, but also his brother.  There can only be one winner.  Joseph sets out to rid the galaxy of the likes of Satan, his brother and their kind.  In the process, he will lose more than he has bargained for.  His faith will be tried in the ultimate test.  Could God have made a mistake?  Will the ring be enough? Will good prevail over evil?<br />Although this story takes place hundreds of years into the future, it still has as its basis the always present and never-ending battle of good versus evil.  In his freshman attempt, James Michael Kelly writes a fascinating epic adventure about the power of faith in a futuristic world.  He shows the depravity of evil if allowed to reign unchecked.  I did have a few problems with his use of imagery.  Some of the scenes could have been a little more descriptive about the galaxy and the lay of the land, so that I could fully visualize the planet as the action was taking place.  This did not, however, distract from the intent or the message of the book.  This is just one fantasy fiction lover's need for description.  I feel that with a good editor and experience from this first book, Kelly will only get better. I am awaiting the sequel to this saga.  For all you science fiction and fantasy fans, this is a new author to take a look at.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersd.

The Ghost of Turtle	Rowtina Washington is shocked, devastated, saddened and appears to be depressed, at the death of her husband Terrance \\"Turtle\\" Washington.  Rowtina, an emergency room nurse, and Turtle, a UPS driver, had a close and happy marriage to the point that Turtle was Rowtina's world.  Her only associates are her co-workers and her mother.  Even with prodding from Turtle, Rowtina never did step outside the marriage to form other bonds.  Fate steps in and Rowtina is introduced to two members of the Leave Him and Live Sisterhood.  As the name implies, the sisterhood is not made up of a group of women who have lost spouses, but unites women who need a release, a friendly shoulder and an ear.  Regardless of the problem, the Leave Him and Live Sisterhood is there to lend a hand, not by counseling but by presence.<br />The sisterhood consists of the motherly Osceola, the free spirited lesbian Nelda, the physically abused Lucy and the \\"please marry me\\" Egyptia.  Each woman brings to the group her own eclectic brand of personality and humor challenging Rowtina to let go and live.  Added to this mix is Rowtina's domineering mother, Sylvia Mention.  The story sets itself apart from others with multifarious characters, the visiting ghost of Turtle and Rowtina's dreams and musings.  To further complicate matters, Rowtina moves from Harlem to Greenwich Village, where she meets Picasso Alegria, a local Mexican salon owner, and her entire world is turned upside down.  However, the sisterhood is there to instill faith, confidence and encouragement.<br />ONE FOOT IN LOVE will appeal to the masses because the theme is universal.  How do you handle the death of a loved one; how do you relinquish it and move on? The writing is excellent simply because of the characters clever, witty and sarcastic remarks that will make you laugh out loud!  How the author, as a man,<br />was able to grasp the personalities and behaviors of the female characters' and showcase it with credibility, I will never know but I certainly enjoyed it.

To commit or not	Dare I say it...at first glimpse of this novel; I geared myself for some raunchy tales of a man's pursuit of lust and how he emotionally brutalized women in his quest for self-satisfaction.  Well I admit it, I was wrong.  In CONFESSIONS OF A WOMANIZER, I was wowed by Stephen E. Chatman's intense and often brutal assessment of his life as a womanizer.  At one point he writes, \\"The curse of the womanizer is to have an attraction for what we can not have and a refusal to settle for whom we are with.\\"  He covers the full gamut of relationships from platonic to romantic and everything in between.  He provides a lot of insight on what contributed to his life as a womanizer.  I found myself amazed at his deep examination of self and secretly wondered if other men experienced relationships in the way he did. His account also provided me with a look at women and how we may contribute to a man's failure to make lasting commitments in relationships.<br />CONFESSIONS OF A WOMANIZER reads like a journal as Chatman eloquently writes of his exploits in subtle, non-demeaning ways.  In one relationship he describes the anguish of just coming together, \\"We had all the pieces to make a great couple, but neither of us knew how to complete this puzzle.\\"  The title of this book does not invoke sympathy, but within the pages, I began to sympathize with the man and how lonely he was in his life as a womanizer.  It appears as if he cries out for commitment at times and runs for the hills at others.  This book will make you uncomfortable as he steps on toes with truths about relationships and roles both men and women play in them.  His stories are sometimes funny, enlightening, thought-provoking and heart wrenching.  This is an excellent book and one to be savored by both men and women.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The Sweetest Temptation	SWEET REDEMPTION by Moody Holiday is the sequel to Wild Innocence and stars Shanelle Brown, a college student and Alex Foster, a police officer.  Set in inner city North Orange, New Jersey and suburban Lakewood, SWEET REDEMPTION tells the story of a young girl lost, looking for love and finding it in her knight in shining armor. But all that glitters is not gold and Shanelle and Alex both have secrets they must reveal to begin healing.<br />Shanelle is the product of a dysfunctional family that is held hostage by their drug addicted and crime-ridden son and brother, Steven. As a result of the attention he receives and Shanelle does not, she is forced into the arms of Alex. In a very serene manner, Holiday showcases Alex's controlling ways and Shanelle's desire for independence.  With Alex, it is his words and moods that tune us into who he really is and with Shanelle, Holiday treats us to her musings, dreams and poetry, that define her needs and wants.  The problem is, Shanelle has nowhere to turn but to Alex and his family.  Alex's family appears to be the picture perfect family and embrace Shanelle with open arms.  Alex is the only son of five children and is doted upon by his family.  Alex always gets what he wants in a calculating manner and after meeting Shanelle and running into her three years later, he goes about his plan for the perfect family.  As the story develops, Shanelle's life revolves around Alex and tending to his needs; Shanelle's plans remain in the recesses of her mind.<br />SWEET REDEMPTION is filled with social commentary and provides some life lessons for parents and children that speak volumes of our need to pay attention to the world around us.  Holiday's writing is fluid; her characters and the storyline are developed while transitioning between the past and the present, dreams and reality.  The poetry is tranquil and speaks of the longing from the depths of a young girl's soul.  While the first installment is about survival, the sequel highlights avoidance and is somewhat more mature in terms of the delivery.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Angels of love, Angels of death	ANGELS conjures up the beauty and spiritual nature that these heavenly beings are, however, in this story angels are demons as well as the lost spirits of the dead.  With romance as a backdrop, the author takes us on a paranormal course in mysticism, danger and sensual romance.<br />The story begins with a murder victim with unusual puncture marks on his neck.  Ameil Le Dutierre, the lead detective in the case, realizes he has no true leads and people are still dying, so he does not object to our heroine, Kayla Hazelwood, an African-American psychologist, being enlisted to help solve these crimes.  Even after following a lead to an underground gothic club, the two find they need more assistance because what they are dealing with may not be human.  They are led to Dr. Connor Biantagglia, a paranormal psychologist.<br />The three set out on a course to stop the destruction, but along the way something unusual happens to Ameil, and they realize they must solve the murders alone.  The forces they are dealing with are beyond Kayla's comprehension, but Connor reassures her that they will solve these unique serial murders. As Kayla and Connor continue to work together, sparks of romance ignite between the two.  They are drawn to each other by lust but find spiritual love is within their grasps.  They partner not only to demystify paranormal occurrences but to strengthen their love.<br />ANGELS was a very different read.  The paranormal events, demonic sacrifices and ghosts of lost souls are not the usual elements in a romantic story; however, it really helped to make the story interesting.  The novel is a bit difficult to sustain your attention in the beginning, but it does improve with perseverance.  The author wants you to really feel the romance between the two main characters, but because of the weak character development and at times stilted dialogue, the romance is stiff and unbelievable.  The lust generated by the characters was more believable.  While the romance was one-dimensional, the paranormal essence of the story was great.<br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersas one-dimensional, the paranormal essence of the story was great.  <br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23
Twelve Steps	What happens when you deny you have a problem?  What happens when the problem overwhelms your life?  What happens when your employers do an intervention?  You either decide you can find another job or you pack your bags and head for the nearest treatment program you can find.  Augusten Burroughs, in his amazingly honest memoir, takes the high road and heads to a treatment program that works specifically with homosexuals.<br />Augusten Burroughs is a 25-year old advertising executive with a serious alcohol problem.  He denies that drinking until he forgets or being late for work on a regular basis is a problem.  He denies that the looks of his clients and the disapproving stares of his co-workers are because he reeks of alcohol and has a disheveled appearance.  He believes that everything is fine and as long as he sets his alarm clock before he goes to bed, no one will know of his nightly binges.  Unfortunately, this is part of the denial process of an alcoholic.<br />Initially upon entering the treatment center, Augusten wants to hightail it out of there because he feels he is in the wrong place and that his problem with alcohol cannot be that bad.  However, it does not take long for him to realize that he is an alcoholic.  He spends 30 days in treatment and returns home a changed person outwardly, but we soon realize the emotional issues that have plagued him since his horrific childhood cannot be overcome within 30 days.  In fact, he must face the illness that may kill his best friend and one true love, Pighead.  Although Augusten wants to maintain his sobriety, he struggles and eventually falls off the wagon and the reader can see it coming a hundred pages out.<br />DRY:  A MEMOIR takes the reader on a personal journey into the life of an alcoholic, who just happens to be gay.  His haunting childhood seems unbelievable.  Augusten Burroughs tells us his story with humor, honesty and depth.  His story is a testament to the struggles of alcoholics and those who are victims of childhood abuse.  This was a creative story of truth that will grasp the reader from the very first page.

Emotionally Charged Poetry	In her debut book of poetry, NILE RIVER WOMAN, Kola Boof presents a strikingly emotional and somewhat controversial view of the world through the eyes of an intriguing and remarkable woman. To fully understand the depth of her writings, the book tells a bit of Boof's biography. Born in Africa as Naima Bint Harith,  Kola Boof was orphaned at an early age when both her parents were murdered for their activism against slavery.  She then moved to America where she spent her formitive years.  Returning to Africa, she became an activist, a feminist, Osama bin Laden's mistress, and generated so much controversy that she was ordered to death.<br />NILE RIVER WOMAN contains 52 emotionally charged poems, which tackle issues such as religion, slavery, racism, and feminism. Although at times the poetry is graphic and explicit, it conveys just how much the author has had to endure.  While I may not agree with Boof's political ideologies, the intensity of her writings and the knowledge of all that she has endured made this one of the best books of poetry that I have read in a while.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-23

She has a wonderful job, is currently enrolled in college, has written a book and has a very supportive family and a select group of friends.  However, her romantic relationships have not been wonderful.  Julie finds it difficult to find men who want commitment, since most just want to exorcise their curiosity about a transsexual.  After being in several unfulfilling relationships, Julie meets the man of her dreams who accepts her as a transsexual.

The story explored the good and bad consequences of loving a transsexual as well as the insecurities the main character harbored.

This particular incident has her reflecting on her life, her decisions and the lies and deceit that have been enmeshed in her family's history.<br />Shawna Carter is a young lady whose life has been a true emotional rollercoaster.  From a biological father who failed to give his daughter the nurturing she needed, to a line of men who used and misused Shawna, contributed to her lack of self-worth.  She struggles to find love in each of her relationships; however, she continues to make one bad decision after another.  Knowing she is not coping well, Shawna obtains counseling with Keith Sanders.  With Keith's guidance, Shawna learns to take a deeper, more introspective assessment of self.<br />This novel was filled with family secrets, death, adultery, suicide, child molestation, and several other social ills. The many subplots seemed to give the story an unclear ending, instead it seemed to dangle which made the main story a bit difficult to follow.  The subplots tended to give the story no clear ending instead they seemed to dangle.  One example is that the author mentions early in the novel that Shawna had anxiety problems in high school which she hid. Yet, the anxiety issue was never resolved or mentioned again.  Although THE SCREAM WITHIN is a page-turner, the plot needs to be polished to flow at a more comfortable pace.  The story begins with Shawna in the psychiatric ward and flashes back to her childhood and moves on from there.  However, some issues thrown into the novel just did not go well with the story; they were either too blatant or done for some effect.  The author goes through the many mistakes Shawna makes over the years as well as her bad choices, but you do not really get an understanding of why.  At times you may think it is because of the family secrets, her childhood abuse, or even the feelings of abandonment by her father, but the author leaves it up to the reader to assume the why. More extensive character development was also needed so they would be more multifaceted.

Not guilty!	Geraldine Hughes, a legal secretary who worked for the lawyer who brought the original child molestation charges against Michael Jackson in l993, writes a convincing chronology of the events that led to Michael settling the case out of court. While settling made Michael appear guilty to much of the public, Hughes shows us, using the court records, just how the system was working against Michael. For instance, a civil suit was filed while the criminal proceedings were still open. In a civil case, the rules for evidence are more relaxed. Generally speaking, judges will not permit a civil suit to proceed before the criminal case so that the defendant will not incriminate him/herself. This was not the case for Jackson. The civil case was allowed to go on.<br />Ms. Hughes also treats us to the calendar diary that she kept while she was working for Barry Rothman, who was hired by Dr. Chandler, the victim's father. Included are telephone calls that implicate Dr. Chandler in an alleged extortion attempt. Chandler allegedly wanted money for not going forward with the case. Hughes also lists the court filings and legal procedures that occurred.<br />Hughes presents a convincing case even if reading all the legal proceedings does get a bit tiresome. The book should be very welcome to Michael Jackson fans and others who wanted to know what really happened. She also lists the many kindnesses and charities that Michael Jackson sponsors around the world for children as further proof that such a kind man could not be a secret monster.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-22
Tired of overworking?	Are you like countless Americans who are aware they are overworked but don't know how to escape? Do you find yourself pushing harder and harder and still not feeling fulfilled? Is life passing you by while you work yourself into a stupor each day? How about your family and friends, do they see so little of you that they may be in danger of forgetting who you are? If you answer yes to any of those questions, Christine Elliot's book, THE OVERWORK TRAP was written with you in mind.<br />Elliot points out that those who get trapped by overwork have plenty of reasons to explain why they work sixty to eighty hour weeks. They use every excuse, from sudden corporate downsizing to `it's expected of me,' without realizing that they ultimately have control over their own lives. The overworkers also have the final say about how much joy, fun or family they are willing to sacrifice to satisfy some nebulous need that rarely lives up to the myriad excuses for continuing to overwork.<br />Exercises at the end of each chapter help the overworker recognize the trap and gives concrete ways to escape for a better, more satisfying life. Even for those who are not overworked, this is a good book to read because it shows how many of us are letting the wonders of life pass us by without ever recognizing it as an issue.<br />Elliot does a good job of getting us to understand overwork and how we can find a better life no matter how dedicated we are to that lifestyle. She makes it attractive to contemplate a better way of doing things.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-22

Did I Say That Right?	Have you ever used a word in a conversation and were not sure it was correct or<br />wrote a paper using a word and you were not sure of the meaning?  If so, WORDS<br />YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW is the reference book that was written for you.<br /><br />WORDS YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW is fun, witty and engaging.  While I enjoyed<br />reading it immensely, I also learned a few things in the process,  such as the<br />correct use for the word unbelievable.  Unbelievable is commonly used as a synonym for fantastic or great, when it actually means that something is not believable or not the truth.  Each entry is followed by a short anecdote on the proper use of the word.<br /><br />After reading WORDS YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW the reader will have a better command<br />of the English language and a better writing advantage.  You may not be able<br />to apply your new found knowledge among the general population because the<br />commonly misused words are widely accepted as correct.  WORDS YOU THOUGHT YOU<br />KNEW  is a reference book that every writer and public speaker can benefit from.<br /><br />Reviewed by Aiesha Flowers<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-22

While not completely over her first major love affair, she finds that she is able to live in the same town with Evan's father without trying to find him. She does vow never to let a man get that close to her again.<br />Austin, a good Samaritan who grew up without a father, works with fatherless boys. He is the \\"big brother\\" to Evan's cousin, Rashon, whose mother is drug addicted and his father is unknown. Since Denaire has moved in with her mother and her sister's children, Evan becomes part of the group nurtured by Austin. Frequently Denaire accompanies Austin on outings with the children and finds herself attracted to him. The feeling is mutual. Unfortunately their path to true love is strewn with old relationships, Austin's mother feels that Denaire is beneath her son and Rashon has feelings of jealousy at being displaced by Denaire.<br />AND I CRY is a good, fast read that explores relationships between different classes of people, irresponsible parents and rescuing troubled boys. The book makes a subtle statement about upward mobility in the ghetto. Marian Elaine also explores those differences and is honest in her approach to dispelling the myth that America is a classless society.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSTAZ Reviewers	2004-06-22

Conner is torn between his loyalty and love for his wife and his duty to this child whom he loved at first sight.<br />TRUTH BE TOLD was literally the best book I have read in years. Ms. Murray did an outstanding job of showing this family's struggles and triumphs. Ms. Murray's characters were so lifelike I had to remind myself that this was a fiction novel.

Ms. Murray did it right and has a definite winner on her hands in the TRUTH BE TOLD.

Protection at any cost, is it possible?	In this third book of the series, THE HUNTED, Damali Richards, the first Neteru in a thousand years, continues her divine mission to rid the world of vampiric evil.  The story begins a few days after the battle in the Dark Realms when The Vampire Council and Master Vampire Fallon Nuit's plans are thwarted as they tried to get their hands on a ripening Neteru, for the purposes of producing a \\"day walker.\\" The battle weary Covenant, the Holy council anointed to protect and guide The Neteru, has dwindled in numbers as a result of the war and is searching for Carlos who has been missing since then.  Their search leads them to a desert where they find a severely wounded Carlos. They immediately nurse him back to health and bestow a renewed purpose for protecting Damali.  With determination and audacity, Carlos resumes his double agent ways as he is torn by the need to protect Damali while at the same time bargaining for his soul and fighting the pull of being a vampire.<br />Damali, now a fully matured Neteru, has lost her `sight' and her faith is wavering.  She is in despair over Carlos, as she believes that a terrible tragedy befell him during the war in the Dark Realms.  Her Guardian Team is also experiencing reduced powers, and their faith is slipping as they each realize that a chance at a normal life may not be in the cards.  There is only one thing that can help Damali, and now that may be lost.  Above all, her protectors trying to keep recent stories of bizarre deaths in Brazil from Damali until she fully recovers her `sight.'  Something very evil from the Dark Realms has been released in the Brazilian territory; its target is Carlos and Damali is standing in the way.  As this evil entity locks in on Carlos, it becomes hard for him to ignore.  Protecting Damali maybe wishful thinking for Carlos, The Guardian Team and The Covenant.<br />In this continuing saga of good versus evil, L.A. Banks kicks it up a few notches.  She weaves into this story a lesson on the power of love as well as some erotic scenes that were enough to make even the straightest Puritan raise an eyebrow or two.  Banks incorporates several subplots of evil deeds from realms of hell and topside to keep me riveted to this book.  I was on the edge of my seat as I waited to see who the ultimate winner would be.  A deeper look inside THE HUNTED reveals not only an excellent tale of good and bad but it also offers an intense look at love, faith and hope on a grander scale.  Despite all the faults, pain and suffering, if we truly believe in our mates, hope serves as a beacon at the end of the tunnel. We just have to trust in the love we share and allow faith to sustain us through uncertain times.  In my humble opinion, this is by far the best book of the series.  I look forward to the next installment in this series with bated breath.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

A Preclude to Marriage	&quot;The Harmonious Way for relationship shopping and maintenance respects your individuality and does not ask you to give up who you are in order to have a love partner. It merely asks you to discover the note that you were created to express and then produce that note loud and clear. If you join up with another note and the music is not pleasing to your soul's ear, then you need to move on and find another note that will blend with yours to produce beautiful music.&quot; This very enjoyable and informative relationship Bible should be in every couple's hands.<br />Turpeau starts out by dissecting the absence of family, and naming decayed marriage relationships as the culprit pulling loose the threads. The author births an often-overlooked reason for the angst in marriages. He emphasizes that the lack of harmony in relationships is at fault in failed marriages and not of \\"any innate faults or weaknesses in the individual parties involved.\\"  He bases his premise and advice on the following principles: Respecting and accepting yourself and others; Learning yourself, your desires, what you want in life and what you want in a partner; Embarking on a \\"mental safari\\" to find, learn, and accept yourself.<br />THE HARMONIOUS WAY is a book that you and your spouse can read together. Along with the thought provoking advice, the book also contains scholarly exercises that punctuate the principles. If you are looking for a refreshing perspective on relationships, marriage, and mating, this book is for you.	2004-05-30

Even with her issues, she has a deep friendship with<br />two male co-workers, Roman and Lance. The two men have completely<br />opposite personalities but, ironically, are best friends.

On the Down Low	Imagine you're married to the man of your dreams, you have three happy children, you live in one of the best neighborhoods in your city, and your family is considered the model in your church community. Your life is as close to perfect as can be. Then one day you walk in on your husband having sex with another man. Unfortunately, this scenario is not as rare as many of us would like to believe.<br />In ON THE DOWN LOW, J.L. King tackles the issue of black men who lead \\"straight\\" lives yet secretly have sex with other men. This type of man has always existed and will most likely always be. But now a new ingredient has been placed into the mix, one that is contributing to African-American women being 64% of the new HIV infections.<br />J.L. King, who lived the down low lifestyle for twenty-five years, does a masterful job of showing this issue from all sides and encouraging the reader to take appropriate action(s). He gives invaluable insight into the down low man's mindset and what men and women should do to protect each other and themselves.<br />ON THE DOWN LOW is very well written and drew me in instantly. This is definitely not a book to start reading at ten o'clock at night if you need to be alert the next morning.  I was impressed with the way King stepped on toes and didn't pull punches, yet didn't sound preachy or accusatory.

The heavy burden of being a hero	BEARING THE CROSS is a very detailed book on the life and times of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., American hero, civil rights activist, preacher and admirer of Ghandi and his nonviolent approach to social change. King came to the forefront of the mid-century civil rights movement when Rosa Parks, a seamstress, refused to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. It wasn't the first time a black woman had been tossed out of her seat in the Black section of the bus when a white customer needed a seat. Along with the removal usually went insults and threats and Ms. Parks just wasn't having it that time. The local activists asked King, a new preacher at Dexter Baptist Church, if he would take on the responsibility. Reluctantly, he agreed to do so and thus began the legend of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />Over the years, Dr. King has taken on an almost mythical position in the civil rights movement. Those who were present at the time find themselves wondering if the Dr. King they remember is the same man that is now raised in the American consciousness. He is frequently given a saintly aura that leads children reading about him in history books to believe there was never anyone like him before and that there can never be another like him again. David J. Garrow dispels those myths as he lets us in on the life of the man who led this country to reconsider its segregationist behavior. We see Dr. King when he is depressed and feeling unworthy of his position in the movement, when he is being a chauvinist about his wife, those moments when he smokes and drinks too much and Garrow gives credence to the rampant rumors that he had women in his life other than Coretta.<br />In addition to the very humanness of King, we also get to witness the foibles of the United States as it dealt with its Black citizens. We get to know the actions of three presidents of the United States, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson, as they vacillated about the civil rights movement. None of them wanted to upset the Southern voting population so they tended to send mixed messages: on one hand they knew that Blacks were being treated unfairly but to offer help through legislation, federal troop protection for besieged nonviolent marchers or verbal support for the movement was beyond where they wanted to go. The levels to which the FBI stooped to discredit King are by themselves, phenomenal. Each of the presidents was definitely aware that King's rights as a citizen of this country were being abused as his home, his phones, his motels, hotels and friends were wiretapped. The agency also used the illegally acquired information to terrorize and blackmail Dr. King. Not one of them objected to this horrendous invasion of privacy.<br />BEARING THE CROSS is a definite must read for every caring citizen of the United States who has a desire to understand and appreciate the civil rights movement, the life and times of Dr. King and the role that the country has played in keeping some of its citizens in bondage.

I would also recommend it as a reference book for the civil rights movement.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<BR>of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
Being Honest and True�	Falling in love can be difficult, especially when you've endured some heartbreaking and gut-wrenching times.  Damon Black experiences love in all its truest forms, and gives love in the same manner.<br />When Damon meets Keisha, he didn't expect to fall in love with her.  Having lost his parents at an early age, he experienced life through the eyes of a doting aunt.  As Damon and Keisha's friendship grows, he imparts what true love really should be within Keisha's heart.  After professing their love for one another, Keisha becomes pregnant, but her childishness, feelings of worthlessness and jealousy consume her, and she commits one of the greatest forms of betrayal.<br />Tara is also looking for self-worth, but in all the wrong places.  Mentally spiraling out of control and clinging to an abusive relationship, she finds solace in the arms of her friend, Damon.  All she wants is for someone to love her and give her the stability she seeks in life.  Although she finds her ultimate dreams embedded within their relationship, can she hang on long enough to truly have him?<br />Alexis is Damon's dream come true.  Finally realizing that he can find love with someone who has their life together, he confidently professes his love.  Even though he is madly in love and wants to spend the rest of his life with her, he cannot turn his back on the people who have helped him realize what being in love really means, and will protect them at all costs.<br />From its inception, the deep-seated values shown within the main character are a true-to-form definition of what a \\"real man\\" is.  WHAT IS FOREVER truly defines what we tend to take for granted, and provides the right amount of pulled heart-strings and watered eyes.  Although there were a few errors, it did not detract from the storyline at all.  This was a well-written and astounding portrayal of trust, honesty and commitment; the most reverent definition of LOVE.<br />Reviewed by T.

I Have a Dream...	Janet Langhart Cohen bares her heart and soul in her captivating memoir, FROM RAGE TO REASON.  This book is a succinct and elegantly written reflection of her rise from humble beginnings as a poverty stricken black child, living in an Indianapolis housing project, to her renowned interracial marriage to Bill Cohen, the Secretary of Defense under President Clinton's Administration.<br />FROM RAGE TO REASON reads like a virtual who's who of the rich and famous as the author gives insights into her personal interactions with people of note such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Mahalia Jackson, Muhammad Ali, Sidney Poitier and other well known personalities whom she not only interviewed, but was acquainted with on a personal level.<br />One recurring theme is her ongoing battle with trying to overcome the rage she feels about the unjust treatment of blacks by whites who often regard her as not being black.<br />She details her gut reaction to the many instances of prejudice and injustice toward blacks that she has encountered in her lifetime.  She also highlights her many career successes and disappointments, as well as details of her interracial marriages.<br />FROM RAGE TO REASON is a forthright, deeply emotional story of sadness, heartbreak and tragedy, but it is also a story of triumph, healing and reconciliation.  The author states that the book is her attempt to &quot;pay respects&quot; to the people she has known and loved and &quot;to reflect on the lessons&quot; she has learned.  The book does exactly that.  Mrs. Cohen's honesty and biting candor makes this a worthwhile read.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
The Village	BLINDED is a shocking and totally mind-boggling journey into the horrific world of drug dealers and their abhorrent inner-city lifestyle.<br />Disillusioned by her perfunctory existence, Mona, the main character, sets out to find the ingredient that will ultimately make her not-so-promising life worthwhile.<br />When the irascible young woman attends a rap concert intent on &quot;hooking up&quot; with her favorite rap star, she immediately attracts the attention of Camron.  Sparks fly and Mona, a self-proclaimed ghetto queen, comes to see Camron as her Prince Charming.  Although she realizes he is a drug dealer, she becomes BLINDED by his ill-gotten wealth and deems him her ticket to Utopia.  But all is not what it seems.  Mona soon discovers Camron's harrowing secret and may be forced to pay the ultimate price for her life's course.<br /><br />In chronicling Mona's life, the author convincingly questions the wisdom of the old African aphorism, 'it takes a village to raise a child' when that village is comprised of dope fiends and cold-blooded murderers. She hammers home the inescapable truth that the detrimental effects of such a community on the developmental processes, far outweigh the positives, as seen in Mona's rueful existence.<br />For a profoundly despairing tale of desperation and dire consequences told by a convincing storyteller, it doesn't get any better than this.  The reader will be captivated by the humanity of the characters and the story is one that will become indelibly inked in the reader's memory.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
Stuck in neutral?	Are you roaming aimlessly through life wondering why nothing ever works for you? Are there things you want but you don't know how to get them? Do you want to be rich? Educated? Have a wonderful job?

She tells you how to handle the people in your life, especially if they react negatively to your dreams. She talks about how to draw up a plan for your life so you will end up where you want to be in spite of those people.<br />In several short chapters Crawford addresses the issues, gives examples and adds a helpful \\"how to\\" exercise at the end of each chapter. Her advice is given in an upbeat `can do' manner that is inspirational. The book is very helpful, although I wondered at the wisdom, in these economic times, of job hopping to find the ideal situation.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11

Who�s Burden Is It?	In the midst of trying to keep it all together, Greg Tate and other contributing authors share their thoughts on the world today as they see it: whites trying to be black.  The shocking sensation of pointing fingers and exposing what society may deem \\"The Great White Hope\\" is surreal, but embarrassing, nonetheless.<br />From entertaining thoughts of why certain whites deliver their own renditions of what it means to be black, to emphasizing the notion that they need to stay in their place and stop portraying something that they are not, EVERYTHING BUT THE BURDEN touches the sensitive, the desensitized and the current \\"victims\\" of society's finest.<br />To say the least, EVERYTHING BUT THE BURDEN is nothing short of controversial.  With its own spin and opinions on topics ranging from music to art, this culmination of what it means to not have to endure the burden, while at the same time being able to capitalize and cash in on the black burden is done with superb writing style.  Although the main focus is to vent and share opinions, it seems that giving these topics justification for discussion places the real burden elsewhere...<br />Reviewed by T.

Making the right choice�	Written to inform, this book gives a first-hand account of the inner feelings of Atlanta's African American inhabitants who have migrated from all over the globe, through a series of interviews conducted as early on as 1968.<br />Designed to give readers a birds-eye view of what Atlanta is really about, series of questions ranging from prior perception of what Atlanta was touted to be, influences that inspired the actual move and the perception of how the city relates to the black population after arriving are answered.<br />MOVING TO HOT-LANTA is interesting, because it details the sentiments of the residents.  Although this was designed to be informational, it is very lengthy and does not have a storyline to follow.  This book was definitely designed for someone who is interested in doing research on migration patterns, or some other scientific research.  For the average reader, this book may seem boring.  A good concept, but not very well executed.<br />Reviewed by T. Belinda Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
In the Space Between	The concept of the tragic mullato is not a new one in literature; its figure has been used numerous times to characterize that person caught between worlds, caught between cultures, and caught between black and white.  Nicole Bailey Williams uses this concept in her sophomore effort, FLOATING, but updates it, breathes new life into it, and drives it home in a fresh, raw way.<br />Shanna, the narrator, tells her story in short, lyrical chapters, beginning from the first time she realized she was different as a child to her confusing adulthood.  As a biracial woman, she faces many obstacles in her life, including name-calling, pre-judgment, self-mutilation, and heartbreak.<br />When she was a young child, Shanna's white mother abandoned her and her black father.  Though her father was no saint himself, as an adult Shanna comes to realize why he behaves the way he does.  Likewise, she begins to remember the times when her mother was her world and the anger she felt toward her mother after being abandoned.<br />I was enraptured by Shanna's story; though a fairly short book, FLOATING is packed with content.  I was taken by the way the author interspersed poetry into the flow of the story.  Rhythmic and inviting, poignant and heartbreaking, lyrical and lilting, FLOATING is one of the best books I have read this year.  Bailey Williams' writing is sensational, and I am anticipating more fine work from her.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
The Wild, Wild, West	Sean Chandler has introduced me to a new genre of fiction.  It certainly isn't African-American fiction, and I've known of westerns since I was a child.  But he has composed a novel that intertwines the thrill that a western novel inherently possesses with the uncommon perspective of an African-American protagonist, and the result is EBONY MARSHAL.<br />This tale is an adventure in the life of Tyler, a former slave who escaped servitude to fight with the Union Army and is now a lawman in the Indian Territory. The book opens like a classic episode of Bonanza, with the good guys in pursuit of the bad guys atop horses. However, in this instance, more than just the plot thickens; the characters do as well.  We are taken inside the minds of those on both sides of the law, and the emanation is an empathetic journey though the Territory with the marshal and his cohorts, along with some cattle rustlers and gamblers.<br />EBONY MARSHAL was a quick and enthralling reading experience. The book was well-written with the exception of a few inconsistencies. Chandler did an admirable job with the characters, both primary and secondary, and I was especially taken with Big John, a Native American friend of the marshal. I would certainly recommend this book to western lovers, and I'd even encourage those who have not ventured into the western genre to give this one a  try; it offers a diversion from the norm.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
Back in the day	AMBIENT ECHOES is a culmination of Cleo C. Coney's life, told in a candid<br />and sometimes sportive manner. Coney reminisces about those days when a hot<br />spanking followed a disobedient act, when run-ins with the law meant your<br />parents, and when there were no threats of a 911 call for being disciplined.<br />He now laughs about the 'butt' whippings and other punishment he and his<br />three siblings endured during the good-ole days when whippings were common<br />practice. This sharing through prose and poetry gives just a glimpse of the<br />character molding method they went through while growing up. Coney gives<br />thanks and much respect to those two individuals that loved them enough to<br />arrest them from entering a life that befell many of their peers. He finally<br />understands that the chastising were their parent's way of preparing them<br />for life, by making them understand that every action has a consequence or<br />more specifically, every negative action brings a negative consequence.<br />AMBIENT ECHOES is saturated with words of wisdom from yesteryear. Two of<br />the entries, Penny Garden and The Good Ole' Days will invoke fond memories<br />and awaken the child in you.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11
Leave a light on	After editing notable collections like Intimacy and After Hours, Robert Fleming has assembled his own tales of terror in his latest compilation, HAVOC AFTER DARK.  The tales are not typical tales of terror.  They range from a man's curse brought on by his father's indiscretions to a greenhouse full of flowers that feed on humans.  Some of my favorites were a story of a boy who endured religious abuse and one of a faithless bluesman who had a debt to pay.<br />There are none of the stale tales of vampires or werewolves with the scripted garlic and silver bullets; no chainsaw massacres or escaped mental patients.  Adversely, and perhaps with more intensity, Fleming weaves believable stories that are so terrifying precisely because of their possibilities.  The characters in any of the tales could have been me.  With this powerful angle, HAVOC AFTER DARK scared the daylights out of me more than once.  Additionally, none of the stories seemed to have been written just for terror's sake.  Each made me think about the underlying message behind the words.  I am tremendously impressed with this book and with this author.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-11

Drama Time	Are you ready to read a page turning literary soap opera? Do you enjoy reading drama, suspense, and romance that don't always have a happy ending? Then I invite you to read DIVORCE HIM, MARRY ME by Darrin Lowery-Smith.<br />The story centers on Derrick, a 35 year old social worker enrolled in college pursuing his master's degree and who has a crush on his classmate Rose. He fantasizes about her all the time.  Rose is a 47 year old  married school teacher who admires Derrick from a distance. Rose's husband, Michael, a police officer, is intimidated by her decision to go back to college which causes tension between them.<br />Derrick and Rose become friends and although there is a mutual attraction, age difference notwithstanding, Rose has no intention of being unfaithful to her husband of 27 years. Realizing the latter, Derrick develops a romantic relationship with Stephanie who is a single mother with a teenage son.<br />Fate intervenes and Rose learns that her husband has been having an affair with her white classmate, Karen. Unfortunately, Karen has several skeletons that are soon revealed in a very cunning way.  Stephanie's son's father suddenly appears on the scene and decides he wants things the way they use to be, not mentioning the fact that he has been married to another woman for 14 years. The primary and secondary characters come face to face with their individual dramas and realize that it's not easy severing ties.<br />What happens next can be compared to a pi&ntilde;ata filled with suspense, lies, manipulation, violence, murder, eroticism and psychotic behaviors. The aftermath brings out intense actions and decisions that will affect people's lives forever.<br />The storyline was original and much effort was put into giving the reader a unique fast paced novel. I think it was even too fast paced for the author because there were character mix-ups in a couple of areas. However, it did not negatively impact the storyline because the layout of the events allowed you to realize whom the author was referencing.<br />Mr. Darrin Lowery-Smith developed a great plot and the story inscribes his ability to incorporate explanations of his characters' behavioral patterns and the reasons for their choices.

I highly recommend MY FINE LADY as a delightful escape from the mundane for all readers, no matter what their favorite genre is.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-05-01

When all else fails, family is still there	The stark realities of life are often mind-boggling and overwhelming for many.  Some people can handle them and some can't.  Those who can't tend to cover it up or ignore their life.  In CAMILLA'S ROSES, we meet Camilla and Bryant Boston. During a Tuesday afternoon tryst, Bryant discovers a lump in Camilla's breast-a discovery that will change their lives forever.

The depth of the characters was outstanding, as they seemed to come alive within the pages of this novel and then took root within my heart as I experienced their trials and tribulations.  McFadden covers a myriad of issues in this book to include the legends and feelings associated with breast cancer; being black and trying to look white; the effects of infidelity; and the power of the family unit.  This is an excellent book and kudos to Ms. McFadden for another job well done.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswell done.<BR> <BR>Reviewed by Brenda M.

Captivating, Brilliant	Date Reviewed: February 22, 2004<br />Prostitution and female circumcision are juxtaposed in a plot that on the most basic level can be summarized as a love story.  The book opens with a series of colorful, yet emotional scenes that introduce Bishop \\"Chicken\\" Johnson.  At the story's opening, Bishop is a young boy living with his parents \\"Slim Willie\\" and \\"Dimples\\" in the whorehouse that they run in Birdtown, Alabama.  Growing up in a whorehouse meant that Bishop was exposed to a lot more than the average child his age, but the familial relationships he shared with the prostitutes working out of his home, his father's protectiveness of ALL the women in his house, and his parent's special relationship taught him important lessons that would carry him throughout his life.<br />In Kenya, Abeni is the only daughter of a powerful Kenyan man.  As part of their tribal tradition she is forced to undergo a female circumcision at a young age.  The ritual not only leaves her physically mutilated, but also emotionally scarred.  As she grows up, Abeni must endure many painful experiences including sexual abuse, and ultimately social isolation.  But her life is forever changed when she meets Bishop, who ends up in Kenya working with the Peace Corps.  Although the two have completely different backgrounds they both carry the luggage of a painful past.  They marry and it seems that their love for one another helps both of them heal; that is until their own daughter has reached the age at which she should be circumcised.  It is at this point that Bishop and Abeni must decide for themselves what a woman's worth is and make some difficult decisions.<br /><br />A WOMAN'S WORTH is not meant to be a quick read; instead it should be savored and absorbed.  It is like comparing an extra value meal to a classy steak dinner, both can ease the hunger pangs but in completely different ways.  Tracy's characters don't jump off the page, they sneak into your heart and the result is an unforgettable read.  This book will make you question what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman.  Themes of sexuality, race, gender and love are presented in a way that is not preachy but force you to re-examine your own values.  Pay close attention because every word and every sub-plot fits together to form an intricate puzzle which the author puts together piece by piece until you reach the book's dramatic conclusion.  I was thoroughly impressed by her attention to even the slightest details regarding both characters and plot.

The Brightest Child	With a title like &quot;THE DARKEST CHILD&quot;, one might venture to assume that the narrator in such a book would obsess over her skin tone.  This is not the case with Tangy Mae Quinn.  True, she is Rozelle Quinn's most deeply hued child, but Tangy Mae doesn't dwell on that fact, and this isn't just another book about the darker children being treated unfairly.  In Rozelle's household, all of the children are mistreated, regardless of their color.<br />It would be simple to say that THE DARKEST CHILD is a coming of age story, but I saw it as much more than that.  This is a book that reaches in and pulls you out of your comfort zone. You are forced to deal with atrocities and injustices committed against innocents. You are destined to become angry with a mother who imposes cruel and torturous living conditions on the fruit of her womb.  You are forced to take a look at why people behave the way they do instead of writing them off as evil.  In a word, you are made to think.<br />I saw Phillips' writing as a personal conversation with Tangy Mae herself.  I was never distracted by the writing, one of the most important ingredients in a well-written novel presented in the first person.  I was shocked by this book, I wept for the characters, and I felt much of the same emotion as if Tangy Mae were sitting in my presence telling her story.  The title is actually a work of irony because Tangy Mae was, in fact, one of the brightest children I have known.  In essence, she made lemonade out of the lemons life gave her.  This is a dynamic, thoughtful, and poignant novel that I am very glad I read.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Fantasy and Reality Meet	BoBo Sinclair is the main character in A.A. Roberts first children's book, BOBO WORLD.  Through BoBo's everyday experiences, the book highlights issues every child can relate to such as school, girls, bullies, and parents that just don't understand.  He also has some extraordinary experiences, some of which have him traveling to other worlds, fighting supernatural beings and interpreting mysterious, otherworldly signs and symbols.  The book opens with BoBo awakening from a dream and realizing that he has a mission to complete; he must make his way to BoBo World before he runs out of time and the world is destroyed forever.  In order to complete the task he must remain focused and ensure that he avoids girls (a broken heart will keep him from completing the mission.)  What follows is a series of antics that take place in a myriad of places, from the classroom, to the playground and even a Halloween party.  Along the way BoBo learns important lessons about life, friendship, love, and letting go of the past.<br />The author introduced a series of twists and turns that kept the story going at an enjoyable pace.  BoBo's humorous perspective coupled with a series of diverse and interesting characters are sure to keep children laughing out loud while anxiously flipping to the next page to see what comes next.  I really enjoyed the fact that there were strong African-American characters that provided positive examples for readers.  The story also addresses some serious issues such as parental abandonment.  The author handles the sensitive topics with a subtlety that is to be commended.  Children will be able to take away the message that they shouldn't blame themselves for adult problems.  BOBO WORLD, with its strong emphasis on fantasy and adventure, offers a fresh new voice to the existing body of African-American children's literature.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Bi-Curious, Bi-Sexual or Gay?	This is the question our main character must answer as he tries to live his life in a world that does not embrace such a difference.  COLORFUL MATTERS takes a look into the world and the effects of an African-American man who lives a `down low' lifestyle.<br />Ken Jackson takes us on a journey with Keir McBride as he struggles with his inner feelings and desires beginning in high school.  A chance sexual encounter with a classmate begins his sexual identity crisis.  From this experience, Keir cannot deny his strong attraction to the same sex but he knows he must keep that part of his life a secret.  As Keir matures into his manhood and continues his quest for self-discovery, we start to empathize with his struggle and his fears.  When something tragically happens to a former lover from his college days, Keir vows being gay is not the lifestyle he wants to live.<br />In an effort to live a normal life, Keir meets and falls in love with Tia Loren, a young flight attendant who embodies everything he is looking for in a relationship.  As their relationship progresses, Keir thinks his desire for men has been abetted.  While his career and life are on an upswing, Keir decides to propose marriage to Tia after a two-year courtship.  Initially, Keir is excited about his upcoming nuptials, but after his bachelor's party the old fears and desires resurface and he finds himself in a place emotionally where he doesn't want to be.  This is also when he meets Troy Bevies, an attorney who works for the same company and they embark on a friendship, but the friendship develops into much more, and eventually leads to a love triangle.  Keir must decide whether he wants to give in to his true desires or do what his family and society deem acceptable.<br />COLORFUL MATTERS examines the tortured soul of a young man who desires men, but must surrender to what is acceptable by society.  Ken Jackson has written a startling, honest and graphic portrayal of a man struggling with his sexuality.  Since this is the first in a series, the author sets the stage for its sequel and purposely leaves you with questions.  An issue that seemed to plague this story was the narrative voice.  In the narrative portions, the voice was a bit awkward; it is difficult to articulate, but it's like a person talking about themselves in third person.

Keeper of the House	ALL I NEED TO GET BY by Sophfronia Scott is a very emotional look into the lives of family members affected by a sibling's drug abuse.  Crystal \\"Crita\\" Carter is the second oldest child of four who currently lives in Harlem as a successful owner and operator of an accounting business.  When called home to deal with her father's illness she is confronted with her past or with what she thought was her past.  Lincoln Carter is the eldest child and only son of the Carter family; a former corporate employee, former high school and college track star and all-around charmer, his life has been ravaged by the usage of drugs.  Finally there is Demetrius \\"Tree\\" Templeton, a schoolteacher and Crita's former lover.  These two men hold the key to Crita's heart and her psych and returning home only ignites her passion and fury of the past from which she ran.  For Crita and Linc family loyalty always came first but at a cost; a cost that Crita could not comprehend but Tree could see coming.<br /><br />Set in the small town of Lorain, Ohio, ALL I NEED TO GET BY also delves into the musings and anger of other important characters and their behaviors of the past and present when presented with Linc's illness.  How each person copes is drastically different.  Ella, the third oldest living in Virginia, escaped as a child by making herself pretty and staying away from the home as much as possible by dating a slew of suitors.  Hazel, the youngest and current college student, sets a dangerous plan in motion so the family can rid themselves of Linc once and for all.  As a child she chose to ignore Linc as if he did not exist.  Chandra, Linc's wife and their daughter Savannah, has a stake in Linc's life and we are treated to those effects. Chandra has a past with the drug abuse issue, a past which she refuses to repeat.  The story weaves back and forth between the past and present and also utilizes dream sequences that make for a very complete story filled with pain and anguish but also hope and determination among the characters.<br /><br />The delivery is superb with the use of metaphors and imagery that could rival the best.

Short and Sweet Food for the Soul	Debut author Monifa Robinson shares her testimony and her life experiences in her book, WITHIN YOUR REACH.  Although the book is small in size, its heartfelt message is big. The author shares insights, inspirations, and motivations on twenty-three topics, such as patience, encouragement, and self-pity.  These topics deal with circumstances and emotions that we all can relate to.<br />What I enjoyed most about the book is that after discussing each topic, Robinson gives a bible verse that relates to the topic, and she gives a discussion question that allows the reader to ponder the topic and apply it to their life.  In her introduction, the author states that this is just the beginning of things that she would like to share with the world. If this work is any indication of things to come, I eagerly await her future literary endeavors.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Where Is Your Faith?	By any onlookers standards, Lynnette and Robert are an ideal couple.  The two have been together for 21 years, have a beautiful home and two teenaged children that would make any parent proud.  In addition, they both have their own small businesses, Lynnette is an interior designer and store owner.  Robert has his own construction business, and he frequently works with his wife.  When Lynnette gets what she considers to be devastating news regarding her health, life as she knows it begins to change.  Her once stable marriage is suddenly shaky and less fulfilling. Many of the things she once considered top priorities no longer seem important.  As the story progresses, the family tries to adjust to the tumultuousness that the changes in Lynnette bring and just when they seem to reach a turning point, the family is slammed with even more shocking news.<br />A MEASURE OF FAITH is a somewhat predictable story and it lacks the powerful spiritual message that is the hallmark of Christian Fiction.  The characters attend church and occasionally refer to God or Christianity but this was more of an afterthought instead of being central to the story being told.  I found it difficult to relate to and feel for Lynette, she came across as overly whiney and self-centered.  I think the author did a reasonable job developing the character of Lynette and working in enough about her past so that readers could understand her better.  However, some of the other characters in the book were one-dimensional and I would have liked to have seen more character development so that I could understand what made them tick.  Despite these limitations A MEASURE OF FAITH is a light, pleasant read that is a noble freshman effort by Maxine Billings.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Anger Management.	THE ANGRY BLACK WOMAN'S GUIDE TO LIFE is an outrageously funny, no holds barred book that takes you deep into the mindset of ABW's (angry black women) everywhere.<br /><br />Not your typical &quot;how-to book&quot;, this guide is chock-full of questionnaires, quizzes and scenarios (including what and what not to do).  Got a trifling man?  Bad children?  If so, then you definitely need to read this book.  It not only deals with those issues, but it also shows you how to effectively deal with racists, situations in the workplace, those &quot;ghetto fabulous&quot; people that we oftentimes hate to claim as a part of our race, and any other situation that you can think of where finger-popping, neck-swiveling, talk to the hand gestures, and instant attitude would be the ABW's first reaction.<br /><br />A mere 160 pages, THE ANGRY BLACK WOMAN'S GUIDE TO LIFE is short and to the point.  I often found myself laughing out loud and nodding my head in agreement with everything, as will most other women who read this.  I also realized that I may be in denial about it, but I am an angry black woman, and there is nothing wrong with a little righteous anger.  This was unequivocally the best &quot;how-to&quot; book I have ever read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Who Was Sleeping	WHY SLEEPING DOGS LIE is a perfect example of the search for power, which ultimately translates into greed. Several years ago Mallory Baylor left Atlanta via Philadelphia with a secret and ends up in New York City as a staff writer for the urban magazine Heat.  Mallory is given the opportunity to interview Saxton McKensie, a man from her past who now serves as the guru of Ingram Enterprises.  Ingram Enterprises is the media-operating machine of Deena Ingram, a television diva who happens to be the fianc&eacute;e of Saxton. The interview serves as a catalyst for the story that unfolds.<br /> If you like drama and more drama then this one is for you!  Added to the steamy mix are Nikki, Mallory's roommate and would be model and Beverly, Mallory's best friend and lawyer by trade.  Also, Deena's parents, the esteemed Ingrams of Boston and Greg, Saxton's best friend who is a gynecologist that touts himself as the Love Doctor, adds a humorous touch.  Not only does Mallory have a secret, Deena and Nikki are elusive and secretive as well.  As information transforms from the lips to newsprint, backstabbing is apparent and abundant.<br /><br />WHY SLEEPING DOGS LIE is very well written and the transitioning is easy enough to follow.  A few of the negatives are most subplots are not fully developed, such as Saxton's involvement with his sisters; they are mentioned and appeared to have had a wonderful childhood but how do they play into his world as adults, is the question.  Designer fashions and labeling was overdone, each time a character changed clothes we were treated to the brand name for each piece of clothing. Mention it once and we get the picture.<br />WHY SLEEPING DOGS LIE is engrossing and will keep you reading.  However, the neatly packaged ending left a lot to the imagination.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02

The Business of Church	CHURCH FOLK by J. Moffett Walker is a short, candid look behind the scenes at the politics of Church of Heaven in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Although serving God is a spiritual matter, there is a business side that people often overlook. In CHURCH FOLK, Walker showcases a variety of characters and how they contribute to the success or detriment of the business of God's temple.  At Church of Heaven, the members attend many meetings in an attempt to deal with various church issues like agreeing on a new pastor, electing deacons, and removing members.  They labor for years to quiet their troubled church and return it to the sweet, peaceful state from which it was altered. As the years progress, the problems never seem to completely disappear, and the members wonder if things will ever be the same again.<br />The political unrest Walker portrays amongst the lives of these fictional members is interesting to read.  Oftentimes, people have misperceptions on the way certain churches operate, and this novel allows readers to take a look behind the curtain to see just who the puppet master is and how he functions.  In order for CHURCH FOLK to be truly enjoyable, though, fundamental changes to the organization of the book need to be made.  There are a plethora of characters inserted into as many pages as possible, which clouds the plot terribly.  The book is divided into twenty-three chapters with incongruous dates which lead to further confusion on what exactly is going on with whom and when. The scriptures included with each chapter seem to have no significance to the main point of the chapter and are often distracting. Overall, it was a struggle for me to really get out of the novel what the author intended to promote.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
The Journey Back	How can so many secrets, so much passion, and so much pain be completely wrapped within one single memory? When has one solitary episode in a person's existence wholly encompassed eternal opposites: love and hate, joy and pain, life and death? Who has ever survived the impossible only to be brutalized by its lingering scent years after? Taj and Cheyenne share that one memory, that solitary episode, and that impossible endurance.  Together, they survived horrors in Jamaica of which their close family members never learned, and, in the aftermath, separated in an attempt to pick up the pieces of their shattered innocence. Twenty years later, everything comes flooding back to the surface when they chance meet one Christmas in New York.  Following that brief encounter, secrets they erroneously thought they overcame begin to haunt their daily existences, threatening to destroy the lives they carefully erected through the years. Desperate to overcome their past and salvage their crumbling futures, Taj and Cheyenne journey back to Jamaica, back to the beginning, back to where they promised each other to never return.<br />JASMINIUM by Jonathan Luckett is a dramatically thrilling ride into the lives of the most unforgettable characters that I have ever been given the opportunity to meet.  An addicting page-turner that I simply refused to put down, JASMINIUM swallowed me with its vibrant imagery, teasing plot, and intriguing characters.  I enjoyed the way Luckett interspersed chapters relating the past occurrences (in italics) to the present goings-on of Taj and Cheyenne.  Hypnotizing surprises lurked within each chapter, steadily and subtly drawing me to the end. Upon completion, I was pleased to know the outcome, but heartbroken to say goodbye to such a good book. Jonathan Luckett proves to be an awesome storyteller and a wonderful weaver of emotional content.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Moon or Summer?	MIDSUMMER MOON by Doris Johnson is the story of June Saxton, an airline stewardess and Matt Gardiner, a member of the famous Mabel Food Company. The premise of the story is their inability to communicate verbally with each other and the havoc it causes.  Duped monetarily by her friend during a business venture, June withdraws into herself becoming insecure and depressed.  Matt saves the day for June but with her lack of trust in human beings, she cannot see the forest for the trees.  Why would Matt make good on someone else's duplicity?<br />This is my first time reading a romance novel by Doris Johnson and I found it delightful and somewhat different. Johnson's locales are serene and made for romance; she highlights large houses that are used to board multiple people, i.e., bed and breakfast type homes and she showcases nontraditional occupations.  One concept that is familiar is the family theme running through the book, which is refreshing.  Several couples and their relationship issues are touched upon which adds a nice flavor to the novel, giving you a different take on the personalities at play and their resolve. Add brooding males, strong willed females and other humorous characters and MIDSUMMER MOON becomes a pleasurable reading experience.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Where it all began�	GONE FISHIN' by Walter Mosley is the prequel to the Easy Rawlins mystery<br />series.  Readers are introduced to a young Easy and his fiery friend Mouse in<br />1939 Houston, Texas.  The story opens with Mouse becoming engaged to his<br />beloved Etta Mae and then going into a funk over his inability to give her the<br />grand wedding that she deserves. Mouse decides to travel, with Easy as his<br />driver, to his home town of Pariah, Texas to ask his stepfather, Reese for<br />help in paying for his wedding. This sounds like a simple task, but it is<br />complicated by the fact that Reese hates Mouse and has vowed to never give him<br />anything.<br />Mosley adeptly paints the journey between Houston and Pariah.  Along the way,<br />he constructs the foundation of the relationship between Easy and Mouse.<br />Together, the pair confronts life, death, and uncovers some ugly truths about<br />themselves.  More exploratory than mystery, GONE FISHIN' provides the back<br />story to all of the previous Rawlins mysteries.  Mosley's descriptions painted<br />pictures in my head and allowed me to see these characters as well as feel<br />their conflict.  GONE FISHIN' is necessary reading for all Mosley fans.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Discovering the beauty within.	As a black woman, have you ever doubted your self-worth?  Are you your own worst critic?  If so, SAPPHIRES AND OTHER PRECIOUS JEWELS is the book for you.<br /><br />As Terri McFaddin so eloquently describes, we are all a beautiful, precious jewel.  She likens the characteristics of black women to the following twelve jewels:<br /><br />Ruby - a woman of virtue and praise<br />Topaz - a woman of vision and reward<br />Aquamarine - a woman who dwells in peace<br />Turquoise - a woman of mercy and grace<br />Sapphire - a woman of prayer and faith<br />Diamond - a woman of strength and prosperity<br />Opal - a woman of dreams and fruitfulness<br />Amethyst - a woman who is trustworthy and sober minded<br />Emerald - a woman of rest and good judgment<br />Onyx - a woman of happiness and abundance<br />Pearl - a woman of wisdom and kindness<br /><br />These are the same jewels that God chose to cover the breastplate of Aaron, the high priest, and brother of Moses.  I found that I identify with the amethyst, which also happens to be my birthstone.<br /><br />From the beautiful front cover to the very last page, SAPPHIRES AND OTHER PRECIOUS JEWELS is full of biblical stories, encouraging words, real-life experiences, and stories created to help guide each of us on our path of self-discovery.  This is a book every Black woman should read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02
Inspired Work	DOING BUSINESS BY THE GOOD BOOK is an inspiring collection of business truisms based on Biblical teachings.  The author of the book, David Steward, is a very successful businessman and the founder and CEO of a billion dollar company called World Wide Technologies.  Establishing his company in the highly competitive \\"tech\\" field was not easy, especially when there were countless naysayers who doubted that a small minority business could garner success in this area.  However, Steward credits his commitment to God's principals as the driving force behind his corporate success.  Already known as a dominant business leader, David and his wife were asked to teach a Sunday School class for business people.  It is this Sunday School class, called Doing Business by the Book, which provided the material for this powerful book.<br />The lessons in the book are set up in an easily understood manner.  Each of the 52 lessons has its own theme and includes a scriptural passage relating to the particular theme.  The actual \\"meat\\" of the lesson includes the author's interpretation of the scripture and his own experiences with the theme.  Steward provides readers with a wealth of information and willingly uses his own experiences as examples.<br />While this book is targeted towards a business audience, the lessons will motivate anyone who reads it.  The book covers a broad array of subject areas, including planning, communication, networking, and flexibility.  However, the most powerful message in the book is that our morals and values should be upheld in all aspects of our lives, including the professional arena.  David Steward provides relevant, hard-hitting food for thought and his personal experiences are just as powerful as the Biblical lessons he teaches.  DOING BUSINESS BY THE GOOD BOOK will provoke readers to examine themselves and consider the word of God before making decisions in their lives.  I cannot recommend this book enough.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersRAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-04-02

Keith, however, refuses to back away.  As they cautiously develop a romantic relationship, things involving the case begin to unravel.<br />Ms. Arthur added a diverse group of supporting characters, each with their own issues, who add much drama and humor to this already volatile story. And when things come together, the finale is fitting and surprising. OFFICE POLICY has an impressive storyline, great characterization and a topic that has affected people in the workplace over the years. It is an intriguing and well orchestrated novel. A. C.

The Awakening	D.V. Bernard presents a fresh viewpoint of the rising violence and scandal in America in his debut novel, THE LAST DREAM BEFORE DAWN. Twenty years ago, Roland Micheaux's innocence was shattered when his father was executed for heinous crimes.  Now, as a successful New York attorney, Roland finds himself face to face with the very thing that he has tried to put behind him.  One night in a parking garage his father's persona comes to haunt him as Roland makes a calamitous move that will send his life into a tailspin and cause him to question reality. Roland then meets Jasper Kain, a seer of sorts, who tries to convince him that the world is coming to an end and that madness will take its reign on the city. Kain's prophecies defy rationale, but Roland soon sees that these ideas should not be so easily dismissed.<br />THE LAST DREAM BEFORE DAWN is a flurry of characters, scenes, and plots, but somehow, Bernard coheres it all together into cerebral fiction that challenges reality and sanity. A distinguished entrance into the literary arena, this novel is splendidly written and brilliantly executed.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
Sex, drugs, violence and more sex�	BOOTY CALL reads like an urban genre novel, where urban society epitomizes shallowness, materialism, violence and promiscuity.  BOOTY CALL is the story of two people living the urban life in New York City.  With the boroughs of New York City as the backdrop, we are drawn into the lifestyle of Shana and Spanky.<br />Shana is a 19 year-old young woman who knows what she wants and has no qualms about how to get it.  She speaks her mind and does not care about the consequences.  Shana's urban reality is about getting the money, the men and the sex.  With two men vying for her love, Shana must face some strong acknowledgments about herself and her life.<br />Spanky is a 21 year-old man who still lives at home with his mother and stepfather.  He desperately wants to be a player like his friends and co-workers.  Spanky is just too shy and too inexperienced to even approach a woman.  Therefore, Spanky lives his life vicariously through his friends and pornographic films until he learns a lesson about love and sex.<br />BOOTY CALL is filled with sex, drugs and violence.  The life of the two main characters is basically defined by their environment and circumstances.  Shana and Spanky's lives never intertwine.  The author alternates the characters in each chapter so their lives are parallel but never do the two paths cross.  The characters unfortunately end up being one-dimensional and carry little emotional depth until the very end of the novel.  Also, the alternating chapters seem to make the plot unstructured.<br />There is a fair amount of sex in this book, hence the title, BOOTY CALL.  It carries enough drama intermingled with violence to keep the reader enthralled.  However, the lack of character development, unpolished plot, time line issues and editing concerns make this an average read.  Erick S. Gray has a good moral message with this novel; however some technical help will make this story flow and read much better.<br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersReviewers	2004-03-15
Life lessons.	FREE AND OTHER STORIES is a compilation of 15 short stories, each with unique characters who are reflecting on the past, learning valuable life lessons, or just coping with everyday life.<br /><br />Several of the stories had a good premise, but the others seemed to have no rhyme or reason to them whatsoever.  Those stories seemed to pick up in the middle of the character's lives, with no insight into what brought them to the point in their lives where their story starts, or they end so abruptly, you're left wondering what happened.  While I had no favorite story, the one that stands out the most in my mind is &quot;All These Years&quot;, which is the story of an elderly couple reminiscing about when they first met and fell in love.<br /><br />Ms. Nailah has the capability to be a great storyteller, and I look forward to a full-length novel where her talents will be better recognized and appreciated.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15

Long buried secrets�	In this emotionally charged debut novel, Zelda Lockhart takes us on a journey through the eyes of a little girl named Odessa as she deals with the consequences of generational curses in her family.  In FIFTH BORN, Odessa is the fifth of eight children in the dysfunctional Blackburn family. She experiences so much abuse that it is hard to understand how the child is able to function at all.  Loni and Bernice head the Blackburn family.  Loni is the alcoholic and abusive father with some deep-seated jealousies concerning his brother.  Bernice is abused by Loni and is portrayed as a non-caring mother that doesn't bat an eye at what she knows is happening to Odessa and then later blames her for it.  Odessa feels that the only people who show her any real love is her grandmother who dies in the beginning and uncle Leland who is killed in \\"self-defense.\\"  As Odessa searches through Grandmama's things, she finds a note in a Bible that leads her on a journey that will uncover secrets buried long ago and changes the course of her life forever.<br />Ms. Lockhart has written a great book that allows the reader to feel the emotional trauma that Odessa experiences as the result of psychological, physical and sexual abuse in her home.  I found myself on an emotional roller coaster, as I dealt with the pain and obvious suffering this little girl endured.  I could've reached into the pages and delivered a knockout punch to Bernice for allowing and participating in brutalizing an innocent little girl.  Lockhart did an excellent job with the characters and capturing perfectly the African-American life of the deep South in the 70's.  Being from the South myself and remembering, I was transported back in time when dad was called \\"Deddy\\" and you only whispered about the family down the road where incest and physical abuse was prevalent.  This was truly a moving experience and well worth it in Lockhart's freshman effort.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15

Right or Wrong?	Everyone dreams of being a star, knowing a star, or maybe being &quot;with&quot; a star.  Kim L. Dulaney boldly tackles the topics of celebrity success and takes a stand for what's right in her sophomore effort, STARSTRUCK: AN AMERICAN EPIDEMIC.  Written in a journal type format, the story flip-flops from past to present, as the author draws a tale of love and loss, friendship and betrayal, and right and wrong.<br />Lela Valentine is an urban socialite who shares with us her story of meeting and befriending an R&amp;B superstar, Benjamin &quot;Beemo&quot; Moore. She gives a sneak peek inside the lives of the rich and famous at things we may think happen, but aren't really true.  As Beemo climbs up the celebrity ladder, things around him start to shake loose and Lela is there to pick up the pieces, make him look good, and get him past his dilemmas.  Yet, there comes a time when she must open her eyes; seek the truth and face it head on.<br />Dulaney seems to ride a very thin line with this fictionalized account of her own friendship and involvement with superstar R. Kelly.  Since I'm not overly into television or music, I could've easily read this story without relating it to real people. In fact, it would've actually been better had it not been pointed out that this book was written to help a friend unable to see the pit he's fallen into. In spite of this, the messages ring clear; the implications of wrongdoing, standing up for what you believe in, and challenging the moral standards of those we've placed on pedestals.<br />STAR STRUCK makes us question our values system and realize just how commercialized our society has become. Dulaney holds nothing back in exposing America in all her glory; the good, the bad, and the ugly.  While I understand the need to get the message out, I'm still not sure I agree with ousting a friend in such a public forum--that just doesn't sit well with me.  Yet, her words are powerful and passionate, while at the same time protective and pensive.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersand pensive. <br />Reviewed by Tee C.

That chance meeting sets off a string of events that prompts Nancy to resort to drastic measures to keep her secret safe and to protect everything she has worked so hard to achieve.<br /><br />WHEN WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE is an absolutely riveting novel.  Gloria Mallette has penned a tale so compelling, the reader will find themselves anxiously flipping the pages, losing all track of time as they become totally caught up in the lives of each of the characters.  Although I wished it had ended differently, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Kudos to the author for a wonderful debut novel!<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
The Lives of Everyday Women	Within the covers of APRIL'S SISTER by Essie Sapp lies a collection of six short stories about the lives of women, their loves, their obstacles and their triumphs. They are everyday women; many you may recognize as a friend, a family member or as yourself.  The representation of the lives of women takes us into a world of interracial dating, date rape, death, drug abuse and the \\"other woman\\" predicament.  Each story features a woman and her story as told in her words or through her eyes giving just enough punch to thrust you into the story allowing you to care about the characters, who are amply drawn.  My favorite story is \\"April's Sister.\\"  The author aptly describes the mother's ability to hold her family together, ignore the gossip and carry on, all through the watchful eye of April.  The story centers on a young girl's emotional turmoil after the violent death of her older sister by her husband.<br />The stories are compelling, the writing piercing and the imagery realistic. However, the short story concept is just that, too short.  The style leaves you with a desire for more developed stories and yearning for more resolutions.  Interesting!  Essie Sapp has given us a commanding little book that entertains subtly and is filled with quick stories that could be possibly enhanced to full fledged novels.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Love in Color	Leah Downey is a young African-American commercial artist who by fate meets Jason Horn, a cop, who also happens to be white.  Both their meeting and thier romance are unconventional. They must face obstacles that most couples never have to experience.  They realize almost too late that ignoring the problems does not make them disappear.  Leah and Jason must examine how their family and co-workers react and how society sees them as a couple.  Then, they must decide whether color should matter when you find love.<br />Sandra Kitt has an uncanny ability to make the reader know and understand each character by giving enough background to make them believable and realistic. The characters are well written with believable depth. THE COLOR OF LOVE begins slowly, but once the plot evolves the reader will find it difficult to put this book down.  Even though this is a romance novel, it did not follow the typical romance formula.  The reader will be able to watch as this couple experiences the good and bad of being in an interracial relationship.  This is not my first time reading a novel by Sandra Kitt, but this is one of my favorites because of her ability to express the complexities of interracial romance.<br />Reviewed by Cashana Seals<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
When old-school meets hip-hop	In DAMAGED GOODS, Alonzo Crane is ten years into a 25-to-life sentence he received for his part in a foiled bank robbery.  This old-school gangster is considered by his peers to have an astute criminal mind.  Because of his criminal smarts, he receives an unexpected chance to leave the corrupt federal penitentiary and start a new life.  The cost of his freedom is the retrieval of a trunk for the warden.  There is only one hitch; federal agents are guarding the trunk.  The job requires a brilliant plan and help from some of his former associates he didn?t roll over on and he expects them to ante up.<br />Crane turns to Duffy, a former cellmate, to help him set things up for his release from prison and track down those old friends.  When Crane finally meets up with Duffy, he realizes just how much things have changed in ten years.  He also meets Trixie, Duffy?s very good-looking white girlfriend who has a desire to improve her circumstances.  As Crane puts his plan in action, things start to heat up between him and Trixie under Duffy?s watchful eyes.  Crane doesn?t count on falling for the white girl, nor does he count on being double-crossed.<br />Roland Jefferson?s fourth novel is an explosive urban crime drama with enough twists and turns to keep your attention.  He tells a very convincing story about a man wanting his freedom so bad that he would do the unthinkable.  The novel contained a good dose of danger, treachery and love.  Jefferson's characters are real, the action is tense and his writing is sinuous.  This was an enjoyable read and one that I would recommend.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

The wrong place at the wrong time.	Publishing editor Jacqueline Blue is a sister with a plan - to move further up the corporate ladder in an industry where blacks are few and far between.  When she is accused of the murder of her boss, those plans go out the window.  Forced to take leave of absence due to the investigation and impending trial, Jacqueline's focus shifts to finding the real killer, thereby proving her innocence.  If the threat of possible life imprisonment is not enough to keep Jacqueline's thoughts and life in chaos, she must also deal with some family issues and the humiliation of finally coming to terms with the fact that the feelings she has for a fellow industry worker are completely one-sided.<br /><br />Although it started off slow, A MEETING IN THE LADIES ROOM quickly turned into a real page-turner.  I found myself anxiously flipping the pages, ready to find out who the real killer was, and the motive behind the killing.  Murder, mystery, intrigue and a little bit of romance all combined make this a novel well worth reading.  I look forward to future works from this very talented author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
A Feast of Peonies	In A FEAST OF PEONIES, author Obi created a memorable tale of sex, deceit, violence, and intrigue. As the reader, you were taken on a roller-coaster ride that was the life, loves and sexual escapades of one Ashanti Ra. Ashanti, an intelligent, successful man, found himself torn between two lovers, a female lawyer and a drag queen by the name of Phyllis, whom he woke next to one morning after a drunken one night stand. As Ashanti struggled with forbidden desires and a jealous lover, the unthinkable occurred, making his life even more complicated.<br />Following a volatile tenants meeting in the condominium complex in which Ashanti resided, Earl, the much-hated president of the tenant's association, was found slumped over a desk in his office. Ashanti was discovered by a fellow tenant standing over the body. At the wrong place and at the wrong time, Ashanti became the prime suspect in a murder investigation. On the lam and searching for the truth regarding what occurred that fateful night, Ashanti realized that few people could be trusted. Desperate to clear his name and uncover what really happened to Earl, Ashanti had to rely on instincts, wits and Phyllis to keep from ending up in a prison cell.<br />A FEAST OF PEONIES was at times shocking and explicit. The plot took many different twists and turns that left me exhausted. There were characters that I believed could have been developed a bit more and the resolution to the \\"mystery\\" was somewhat unsatisfying. However, Obi's unique style of writing drew me into the heart of the action. Unlike other contemporary writers, Obi incorporated spiritual and philosophical ideology about life, relationships and good versus evil into his novel, giving insight into what possibly motivated some of the characters. The author also presented a harsh look into how sexual child abuse affects a person years after the fact. All in all, the colorful characters and steamy scenes kept me turning the page. Obi has written an interesting and unforgettable novel.<br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersnd unforgettable novel.<br />Reviewed by L.

It�s all about the women	I must admit that I was a reading snob.  I avoided ghetto fiction in the same<br />way that I avoided ghetto movies.  I had read a few books in the genre and I<br />hadn't been impressed.  In my opinion, they lacked artistic integrity.<br />However, all of that is in the past.  Wahida Clark's debut novel, THUGS AND<br />THE WOMEN WHO LOVE THEM changed my perspective on the genre and has shown me<br />that there is artistic validity in this field of literature, as long as there's<br />a strong story line and vibrant characters to hold your interest.<br />THUGS AND THE WOMEN WHO LOVE THEM tells the story of three young women (Angel,<br />Kyra, and Jaz) who are raised in a tough urban environment.  As children, they<br />faced a daily reality of crime, drug abuse, and struggle for survival.  Angel,<br />Kyra, and Jaz decided early on that they were not going to live their lives<br />surviving in the ghetto.  Each sought to educate herself and had succeeded in<br />enrolling and doing well in college, studying law, psychology, and chemistry.<br />Their collective weaknesses are their attraction to thugs and street life.<br />Clark takes us on a journey into the lives of these three women.  The ride is<br />exciting and drama filled.  Each character tells her story in her own voice,<br />so the pain and struggle she feels is personal.  I found myself talking to<br />these women, trying to warn them, and yelling at them.  THUGS AND THE WOMEN<br />WHO LOVE THEM widened my reading circle to a place I once ignored.  I applaud<br />Wahida Clark for her ability to reach readers from all backgrounds and reading<br />tastes.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
Learning To Deal With Secrets	NOW THAT THE SECRETS ARE OUT by Teresa Mason Browning is the second installment in the trials and tribulations of Rhonda Camps.  In this sequel to Why I Kept My Past A Secret, Rhonda is facing a series of challenging, life altering situations.  Rhonda is in the clutches of an abusive husband, who will go to any lengths to keep her by his side.  She is also being plagued by a vengeful, jealous co-worker, and a rebellious teenager who refuses to let her forget that keeping secrets can destroy all involved.  Feeling isolated and helpless, Rhonda has to reach deep within to regain her strength and dignity to uplift herself. Armed with a  few good friends, and an unrelenting faith in God is all Rhonda has to help her overcome her tragedies, and hopefully find a way back to peace and love.<br />The struggles of Rhonda and her family were at times moving and inspirational.  Many readers will find Rhonda's trials and tribulations familiar, and take comfort in her faith in God to triumph over them.  Those who enjoyed Why I Kept My Past a Secret will continue to be fascinated with the journey of Rhonda Camps.  However, NOW THAT THE SECRETS ARE OUT, is a stand alone novel that is easy to follow on its own.  The novel's resolutions were, for me, a bit too tidy for such troublesome situations and a few of the situations seemed to happen and resolve themselves very quickly.  Although a few editing problems were noticeable, which caused me to re-read a few passages, the overall plot was not affected. All in all, Teresa Mason Browning has an interesting character and story line with Rhonda Camps.<br /><br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
Overcoming Obstacles	Rarely does a collection of poetry so thoroughly capture the anguish, desperation, dedication, longing, and feeling of accomplishment associated with the struggle to overcome obstacles inherently coupled with interracial relationships.  UNDER THE MELTING POT by Tyrone Vincent Banks is one of those rare collections.  The pages of his book are filled with poems that paint clear pictures of the narrator's struggle to hold on to a love that the world around him condemns.  Difference is not the enemy, but instead a stepping stone to discovering more about the world in which we live, and Banks expertly grants us access to such stones.  Through the course of UNDER THE MELTING POT, he takes us from the initial introduction of his soul mate, to the sacredness of their time together, to the turmoil bestowed upon them by her parents, and to their final decision. Readers empathize with the narrator while wondering all the while if things will ever work out for the struggling couple.<br />Having personally been in the narrator's shoes before, I understand his struggles and identify with his heartache.  The poems here touch me in a special way and I truly enjoyed Banks' collection. Even though it is apparent the narrator's love interest is not African-American, her cultural identity, hid until the last few poems, was a curiosity that drove me to complete the work.  While the story that flows through the poetry is very interesting, the poems themselves lack a certain depth that would have permanently arrested my emotions and taken them on exactly the same ride the narrator experiences.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
Paperboy to the rescue	When Michael Wood refuses to give up his lunch and defends himself against bullies at his elementary school, he's caught in the middle of a group of bullies and uses his quick wit to create a paper airplane to defend himself. From this idea, Paperboy, a new superhero is born. Michael transforms himself and his bike into lean, mean, paper-bearing machines.<br /><br />The next day, Michael is decked out in his paper cape and mask and armed with paper airplanes and a paper laser.  He hops on the Papermobile on a mission to protect the other students and bring decorum to the playground.  He once again gets ready to battle the bullies, but now he has an arch enemy who's out to rule the playground - ScizzorMan.  Unfortunately, he cuts right through Paperboy's paper weapons and challenges him to a fight.<br /><br />From here, the adventure is just beginning as we see the author parallel this story with what we see in our society...the bad guys.  PAPERBOY is a wonderful, delightful story written by 11-year-old Omari Jeremiah who has penned what could very well be a great cartoon/comic strip.  The humor, adventure, and excitement in the book along with the determination and focus on doing what's right without fighting or using violence were wonderful lessons that all children should be taught early on in their lives.  Kudos to the author! I hope to see more adventures of Paperboy.  The story has everything that appeals to children and to the child in all of us.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Finding Your Way	BECOMING MAREN is essentially a coming of age story about Maren and her brother Ellison.  Although they are both in high school, the two siblings lead relatively independent lives because their mother, who is second in popularity only to Oprah in the Chicago area, is a successful television host who works all the time.  Life as Maren and her brother know it is suddenly changed forever when they learn that their mother has died in a tragic car accident.  Afraid and alone, the two are faced with the task of contacting their only known relative, the father with whom they have had no contact in several years.  Soon they are packing their bags and moving across country to live with the father they do not know.  Suddenly they are forced to learn to adjust to less money and more supervision as they develop relationships with their father and his family.  In addition, we follow Maren as she embarks on a journey of self discovery.<br />This book is a complicated tale that draws you in almost immediately.  The characters are well thought out; the plot is complex and engaging and deals with real issues faced by teens such as peer acceptance and racial identity.  In addition, there is more than a healthy dose of family drama and this drama made the book quite a page turner.  I was really enjoying this book until it took a bizarre but not unexpected turn at the end.  This ending really changed my overall opinion of what started out as a five star book.  Still I have a great respect for Africa Fine's talents as an author and am anxious to read some of her other work.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
A little bit, a lot, it�s still sinning	The novel opens with Tina, a recent emotionally separated woman, in a night<br />club doing A LITTLE BIT OF SINNING. It is one week after her husband of twelve<br />years asks her for a divorce. Tina is tough and she rises to the occasion,<br />agrees on the spot and moves into the guest bedroom of their home.  Her trip<br />to the club started out as a litmus test to find out if she was still<br />attractive to the opposite sex.  She learned that she was and armed with that<br />knowledge she embarked on a truly sinful journey. A LITTLE BIT OF SINNING is a<br />story that can be appreciated by any woman who has been in a relationship and<br />gave it her all just to be betrayed in the end.  Tina is down right scandalous<br />in reclaiming herself, and I found myself cheering her on at times.<br />A LITTLE BIT OF SINNING is book filled with drama, twists, and turns that will<br />keep the reader interested in the story.  Poor editing and numerous errors<br />keep this from being a great read.  While the story is compelling, I often<br />found myself getting caught up in improper word use and various other<br />grammatical issues. I think the problems in this book could have been fixed<br />easily with thorough line editing and proofreading.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
Romantic Suspense	Dominique Brandon is a young image consultant with her own business, struggling to make her business successful and live up to the Brandon name.  The Brandons are an affluent African-American family with connections throughout the community and frown upon any type of scandal or hint of anything that will damage their image.  With not only her business to worry about, but also her self-serving mother and irresponsible siblings, Dominique has enough balls to juggle around, but things get worse when she becomes the target of a stalker.<br />Harris Knight is hired to provide bodyguard services to Dominique and immediately they clash.  He's pre-labeled her as a snobby, rich, spoiled brat and she's pegged him as a shady character from the wrong side of the tracks.  In spite of his hard image, behind the facade is a caring and passionate man who continues to help the rural community he grew up in. He learns that Dominique is actually harboring a determination and strength that he's not used to seeing in women.<br />As the stalker gets more and more dangerous, Dominique's life is threatened and while she's very loyal to her family, Harris has questions and wonders if they're really the upstanding family they try to project.  With an out of control sister who seems set on making Dominique look bad, to her dependent mother who is only concerned with living the life she's become accustomed to, and an Uncle who's tried to buy out Dominique, there are hints of shadiness all around the Brandon clan and Harris is set on getting to the bottom of things; even more so when he starts having feelings for Dominique and vice versa.<br />THE BODYGUARD was a wonderful entrance into the literary world for Andrea Jackson. As a bonus, it was really nice seeing the normal &quot;we're too different from each other&quot; scenario unfold in this story.  It's suspenseful, romantic and the climatic ending, though a bit predictable, wrapped up this novel nicely.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A Survivor's Memoir	Monique Douglass-Andrews and her family were in search of the American dream.  Moving from Washington D.C., to Oregon was the family's attempt at achieving that dream. However, upon arriving in Oregon the Douglass family found turmoil and heartache. The events that took place within this family left the author a fragile and broken soul.<br />Monique Douglass-Andrews relates to the reader how she and her family were torn apart by adultery, abuse and mental illness. Following the author from childhood to adulthood, we observe how the trauma of  sexual abuse leaves her to cope with feelings of self-worthlessness, depression, self-hatred and mental illness. We are also witnesses to Monique's self-destructive behavior, self-exile from her family and failed relationships. Throughout the book we are privy to the resilience of the human spirit, as Monique develops a strength and spirituality that saves her from the brink of mental illness and back to rediscovering her family.<br />FROM GHETTO TO GLORY: A MEMOIR is a unique survivor's tale which relates the horrors of sexual child abuse and how it haunts its victim well into adulthood. The memoir is touching and hopeful but there are some things that were left unexplained.  The tale incorporates aspects of the supernatural that at times left me unsure about what was real versus what was part of Monique's illness. There also seemed to be no resolution as to the status of Monique's illness. I also think that the sections where Monique's \\"little voice\\" speaks distracted from the progression and pace of the tale. Still, the memoir is absorbing, and touching.<br />Reviewed by L.

Looking for Love	Author Christopher David audaciously demonstrates that relationships are never easy, whether they're heterosexual or homosexual.  In his novel I'M ON MY WAY, David traces the lives of three main characters and their friends as they each labor to find their soul mates and contend with the reality of being black and gay.  Readers follow the men as they deal with love, loss, vengeance, acceptance, failure, and success.  David unflinchingly strips away stereotypes and exposes readers to the real world of living and loving as a gay man while presenting real characters with real issues.  His three-dimensional characters jump off the page and become men readers can listen to, feel with, and empathize with.  David shows us that whether we're dating men or women, the drama is the same...we are all people looking to love and be loved in return.<br />Christopher David's writing style is poetry in motion, flowing like old school hip-hop. His language is real and it's easy to quickly get caught up in the characters' thought processes and emotions.  The storyline is solid with enough drama to keep most readers entertained; however, this story is about gay men and all that entails.  While David pulls the wool off our eyes with regards to the lifestyle of gay men, some readers may need to take this book in stride.  This author writes with no holds barred which can be a little too much at times for readers who are simply not used to dealing with the intricacies of homosexual relationships.  If you can get past any hovering hesitations and pick up a copy of this novel, you're definitely in for a literary treat.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
A true classic	One word cannot describe this book.  Margaret Walker captured the essence of one woman's struggle that represented so many during a period when freedom was an elusive dream.  It would take a war and many deaths before African Americans became liberated, only to realize later that the chains of oppression were still evident just manifested in other ways.  In JUBILEE, Vyry is born into slavery as a result of a relationship between her mother, Hetta, and the white plantation owner, \\"Marster Dutton.\\"  After Hetta's death, Vyry would be placed in the mansion as a servant to the owners and their children.  Her mulatto coloring would elevate her above the station of a regular field hand and qualify her to work in the \\"Big House.\\"  While in the \\"Big House,\\" Vyry would be subjected to almost daily abuse from the \\"Big Missy.\\"  Sometimes her only peace of mind would come from some of the older slave women who worked in the house.  But when they all finally died, leaving her all alone, Vyry starts directing her own life and dreams, even daring to find love with a free black man.<br />Margaret Walker's JUBILEE is one of the best book written on witnessing the brutalities, triumphs and struggles of African Americans before, during and after the Civil War.  In a true account from her ancestors, Walker has written a riveting tale of life as a slave.  Her main character, the focal point of the book, is one that left this reader in tears from the hatred she received, but spellbound at the compassion she showed to her abusers.  I was captivated by the love she showed for her husband and the stamina she possessed to keep the family and the dream alive. This novel is a fine testament to the life that our forefathers suffered in the pursuit of freedom and should be required reading for all African Americans.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

One Family�s Reality	RENEE AND JAY 2 by J. J. Murray is the hilarious and oftentimes sad continuation to Renee and Jay.  We travel through the daily living of Renee, Giovanni and Janae Luchesi in the southern town of Roanoke, Virginia.  What we witness is an African-American wife, mother, and daughter; an Italian, husband, father and son and a biracial daughter.  Through their daily living we experience the sad commentary of other peoples' racial prejudices towards their union and their daughter. Renee is a high-spirited woman, who loves hard and cursing is the norm.  Giovanni is a laid-back, co-owner of a pizzeria along with his father.  Janae is their ten-year old daughter who knows no color; she is just Janae Vanni Luchesi, a beautiful mixture of her parents and ancestors.  When Janae is forced to choose what race she is, she simply asks \\"why\\".<br />At first glance I wondered where this story was going.  Some may be appalled at the behavior of Renee, Giovanni, Janae and other characters for their mouths are like sewers.  Some may feel that Renee's characterization is stereotypical and generalized, but this is fiction and yes, it can mirror real life.  Yes, there are women, men and children like Renee, Giovanni and Janae, whether they are African-American, Caucasian, etc. If you loved to hate Renee, Giovanni or Janae then this story hits right where it should----you felt the characters; take it for what it is worth.  As the story progressed, I soon found several unpredictable and climatic scenes that went right to the heart of all the players.<br />RENEE AND JAY 2 is a look at one interracial family and their daily trials and tribulations in a not so colorblind society.  It is laced with love, encouragement and understanding and is told in a funny and astounding manner.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
Be what you are and live the life	Allowing society to dictate how you live can bring needless and painful suffering to yourself and your loved ones.  Sometimes it's better to get off the fence and be yourself rather than spend a lifetime trying to pretend by living on the down low.  In UNDERCOVER, Laurinda D. Brown brings to us two stories about living under the disguise of being heterosexual and the turmoil it can cause.<br />Iysha Desmereaux marries Nathaniel Chamberlain Alexander although she has a few qualms just before the ceremony.  Because of her religious convictions, her marriage vows are sacred and she looks the other way when things don't quite add up.  Having married on the rebound, this marriage for Nathaniel is a cover up for his true self.<br />Amil Blake Lindsay is in an unfulfilling relationship with Emanuel \\"Manny\\" Lindsay and has been for many years.  Manny spends so much time chasing his financial dreams; he doesn't really notice the widening chasm between them. She develops roaming eyes and tastes on the internet when she meets Chris Desmereaux, a lesbian living her life openly.  Their surprising face-to-face meeting and ultimate liaison has some particularly unsavory consequences for both of them.<br /><br />Although billed as the sequel to Fire & Brimstone, this novel does stand on its own.  Brown does an excellent job of showing the end result of living secret lives.  She does it with humor, drama and education; an unbeatable combination.  At first, this book turned me off, but the drama hooked me. As the storyline developed, my interest increased and I kept turning the pages as I was pulled into the lives of this colorful cast of characters.  This was just the type of story that brings home the lessons about having unprotected sex, living in the \\"closet\\", living with the truth and living in ignorance as well as the impact of AIDS.  This book serves as a wakeup call for both the homosexual and heterosexual communities.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerseviewers	2004-03-15

After defusing a rather volatile situation in the emergency room of the hospital where she works, Dr. Mallory Russell is pleasantly surprised when fellow physician Bradley Clayton takes a sudden interest in her.  She is a little leery of his intentions, though, and refuses to believe that he sees her as a desirable woman, and not just as a fellow doctor.<br /><br />Known as the hospital recluse, Bradley doesn't have time for anyone, unless it's the children he is determined to save.  When he sees Mallory in trouble, his shell is cracked, his interest is peaked, and he decides to take a chance on love.  Will true love prevail, or will the secrets that each of them harbor destroy any chance they might have at that once in a lifetime, all encompassing love every person so desperately seeks?<br /><br />True to form, Shirley Hailstock has created another good story in LOVE ON CALL, but this one seemed to lack that extra flair that her previous works have included.  Although I feel that this was not her best work, I am a huge fan and look forward to more works from this very talented author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15

Meant to Be?	John Canoe is an artist essentially living his life in isolation.  He sells his work through his affiliation with a cooperative of artists, and also works as a school teacher.  While John has many acquaintances, he doesn't have anyone that he can truly call a friend.  Early in the book his mother reminds him that at age 33, he needs to be looking for a meaningful relationship so that he can marry and have children.  Even in his adulthood John struggles with his identity, his mother is white and his father is black and his experiences with racism from both races have left him wondering where he fits in.  John shares a close relationship with his mother, who lives in Chicago, but has a strained relationship with his father, a notable physician, who divorced his mother years ago.<br />Susie Chang works for a publishing company and is an amateur poet.  She is an American born Chinese woman that has more or less been cut off from her family.  Susie is constantly at odds with the cultural norms and expectations of her family, even her move across country and away from her family is frowned upon.<br />Susie and John meet at a Collective opening and it is practically love at first sight.  What ensues is a whirlwind relationship wrought with ups and downs ranging from typical relationship issues, such as problems with communication, to more complicated issues like familial rejection.<br />ONE FLESH had the potential to be a five star book. The primary plot of the story was thorough and fairly unique.  My problem with the book was that the author introduced too many subplots that he never resolved.  These subplots could have provided interesting twists and turns but instead they acted more like a dangling carrot.  I would love to see a sequel that would address some of the unresolved issues and provide an update on John and Susie's relationship.  Overall, I enjoyed the book and believe it would make for a great book club discussion.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersRAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15

Food for the Soul	LONGING FOR DADDY engages the reader in a wonderful discourse of healing from an wounds created by an absentee father, whether this absenteeism was emotional or physical.  It refers to the subject matter as &quot;an epidemic&quot; that plagues our society.  Patterned similar to a workbook, this read provides sound spiritual guidance that ministers to the soul.<br /><br />The author asserts being fatherless affects every aspect of life - relations with God and others, attitudes, beliefs as well as self-identity.  The book encourages the reader to look to God, who is a father to the fatherless, so that her respective journey of forgiveness coupled with healing can begin.  Readers are urged to accept God as &quot;Daddy&quot; because he is an ever-loving, ever-present force in life that will never leave or forsake you.<br /><br />The Bible tells us that man and woman were created in God's image.  The earthly father was intended to be God's representative.  It is the paramount job of parents to be united in reflecting God's image to their children.  However, when a father is absent from his daughter's life, for whatever reason, the daughter's life is tainted with an emptiness that plagues her entire being.  She is tasked with creating a positive future for herself by forgetting her negative past.  She is able to do this by walking in God's love and obeying his commands.<br /><br />In each section of LONGING FOR DADDY, Mrs. Robinson provides a &quot;growth chart&quot; that is to be used as a evaluative tool to measure the reader's progress in her relationship with the Father.  Mrs. Robinson should be commended on a wonderful, insightful read that would minister not only to women with an absentee father, but to anyone who has had a broken relationship and is in need of counseling on the path of forgiveness.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15
A Journey Within	In her powerful, poetic debut, Rebecca Walker speaks from her very soul about trying to find a sense of self in her ever-changing world. Rebecca Walker was considered a \\"Movement Baby,\\" a child of a black civil rights activist and a white Jewish father who defied the rules and miscegenation laws of the South during the 60's. Her life begins innocently, full of love and a sense of peace, but all this changes with the divorce of her parents. Rebecca spends the remainder of her childhood and teenage years being shuffled back and forth between parents, no longer having a place to call \\"home.\\" She desperately seeks to fit in somewhere, struggling with her own identity of being black and white, often denying what society has tried to label. Rebecca turned to sex, alcohol, and drugs to mask the pain of a disconnected father, an absent mother, and of not truly belonging to any particular group.<br /><br />Rebecca Walker introduces us to the pivotal people in her life that molded her into the woman she is today: the Jewish grandmother who denied her, the boyfriend who became her refuge, her best friend she could not say good-bye to, and many others. It is not until later in life after much introspection, Rebecca is able to understand who she really is, and everything she tried to deny earlier in life is actually a part of her.<br /><br />Rebecca Walker's writing style is fresh and poetic, her words flowing from one page to the next. I could easily relate to Rebecca's pain and sense of not belonging to any particular group while growing up, because I was also a child of two different worlds seeking to find \\"my place\\" in an unforgiving society.<br /><br />BLACK WHITE AND JEWISH is more than an autobiography, it is a journey of love, pain, loss, and forgiveness. It is one woman's journey to embrace her \\"self.\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by Michelle Warren<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-15

Latin love anyone?	Using San Juan, Puerto Rico as the backdrop for this scintillating novel, Celeste O. Norfleet opens the mind and the senses to love Latin style.  In REFLECTIONS OF YOU, Angela Lord arrives in Puerto Rico following a lead to her very vague past.  Her best friend suggests that she try &quot;an island fling with a Latin lover&quot; to loosen up some while she searches for answers.  With her driven personality, Angela has no intention of indulging until she finds her identity.  Her intentions are admirable in this paradise until she meets the devilishly handsome Marco Santos and forms an instant attraction to him.  To her astonishment, the feeling is mutual.<br />It does not help matters any that she resembles Marco's deceased wife.  The resemblance is uncanny and duly noted by several people on the island, but it bothers only one person, Marco's mother-in-law, Isabella Riviera. Isabella sees Angela as a threat to her survival and sets out to ensure that the two of them do not become more acquainted.  However, it appears to be the will of God and the Santos family that the two should be together, which forces Isabella to take some drastic measures.<br />Norfleet starts this novel slowly with suggested hints of being your typical garden-variety romance novel.  What emerges is a well-written romantic story peppered with a little mystery and intrigue to give me something to savor.  Two unforgettable main characters, a nasty villain and a few surprising twists has me adding this author's books to my To Be Read list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

From the depths of despair	BALLAD OF A GHETTO POET is an extraordinary novel about a seventeen-year-old<br />man-child learning life from the harsh, brutal language of the streets. Chico<br />Grayson is growing up in one of the toughest areas of Richmond, Virginia where<br />the only way out seems to be behind the barrel of a gun. He falls in with a<br />sly and dangerous criminal and gets tangled in the city's violent underworld<br />of crime.<br />Possessing a poet's voice, Chico is able to bare his soul as he hears the<br />music of God in the poetry he writes; this is his escape the only time he<br />feels alive. With the right mentoring this could be Chico's ticket out, but<br />the timbre of street life is a decibel louder than the sweet sound of his<br />musings. In too short a time, Chico and his boys are caught in the brutal<br />crossfire of poverty and violence, and headed on a course leading to a<br />cellblock or the grave. The raw street element of the novel may shock and<br />upset some readers, but it should alert everyone that exhaustive efforts are<br />needed if we are to preserve our inner city youth.<br />BALLAD OF A GHETTO POET is a lyrical display of literary drama; it is poignant<br />in its anguished portrayal of life in the forgotten corners of urban cities.<br />It appears tragic and heroic as the teenagers desperately grasp for the<br />chances they've lost and sadly except that deliverance may come too late.<br />A.J. White tells this story with such eloquence and realness, you feel<br />privileged to live inside the minds of the victims. You feel their pain as<br />they succumb to the lure of reaching out for more, while losing their grip on<br />the joy and prospect of life. This is a story for all ages.

The Mecca of show business	Have you ever wondered how the Apollo Theatre began? Who was the mastermind behind the Apollo?  When did the famous \\"Amateur Night at the Apollo\\" begin?  The Apollo Theatre is a legend in both the Black and White communities.  It was thought by many to be the greatest show business place in the world.  If an entertainer could make it at the Apollo, he could make it anywhere.  SHOWTIME AT THE APOLLO by Ted Fox is a fine tribute to this legend.  Fox traced Apollo's history from the tumultuous beginnings in the 1920's through the heartbreaking decline of the mid-70's and its rebirth in the 1980's.  This cultural institution led the way in defining all types of music that changed by decade moving from swing to funk.  He also followed the management era when the Apollo was called other names and located at other venues until it came to rest at 125th Street in Harlem with its Jewish owners, the Schiffmans.<br /><br />Ted Fox gave an excellent history lesson on the life of this musical institution known as the Apollo.  This theatre exerted a lot of influence on the entertainment industry over several decades.  The Apollo could make or break careers.  Some of our most memorable entertainment greats can lay claim to the Apollo being the springboard for their success.  Fox was brilliant in his research of past performers by including tidbits of their personal experiences to give the full spectrum of the theatre's growth and the love felt by many.  For those of you interested in the makings of this phenomenon called the Apollo Theatre, please read this book.  It will entertain and enlighten you.  This is a wonderful book to add to your collection on music history.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-12
Feeling Hot?	Can you say turn up the heat?  This anthology ranges from the tamest erotica to the most explicit, featuring twenty-four authors who have challenged the African-American sexual revolution to the fullest.  There is something for everyone, as the passages focus on many different sexualities and situations.<br /><br />Using a no-holds barred, in-your-face style, this can definitely be classified as \\"nasty\\".  Without a doubt, there leaves little to the imagination.  These authors have put together a package that captures the essence of what the true definition of `getting busy' may actually be. Leaving plenty of room for questions, this anthology also provides some answers to things you may have always pondered, but never knew who to ask.<br />CHOCOLATE FLAVA is definitely on the freaky side, and is not for everyone; especially children.  Also, if you're not into challenging your mind or crossing boundaries, this anthology is not for you.  Some of the stories are subtle, and definitely more interesting than others, but for the most part - expect sex, sex and more sex.  On the other hand, if you're one of those folks who love to live vicariously through others, this may be the book you've been waiting for.<br />Reviewed by T.

Is Love Blind...	Parry &quot;Ebony Satin&quot; Brown, author of the hit novel Sittin' in the Front Pew, makes her latest contribution to the literary world in the form of a collection of short stories by herself and others entitled LOVE IS BLIND.  The collection, also co-authored by Lisa Watson and Pat Simmons, builds from the fact that the characters in the three short romances are brought together by some form of a blind date.<br />The first story, written by Brown, is that of a woman with much going on in her professional life, but little in the romance department.  In this, the information age, she decides to step outside her dating boundaries and find love online.  Another story, penned by Simmons, takes the reader through an exchange of love letters between a talk-radio hostess and one of her fans.  Finally, Watson's contribution tells of a case of mistaken identity during a blind date.<br />This collection seemed to be missing something. It was as if all of the stories were following the romance novel formula with the calculated endings, but what romances have that these stories lacked was passion.  I thought the characters were dull and the stories were fairly contrived.  Some of the writing was good, but the stories themselves were lackluster and laborious.  Perhaps a reader looking for a more fanciful read would have more luck than I had with LOVE IS BLIND.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-12

They are going to take over!	THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING is a combination of romance, race relations and cultural differences all visited upon a small enclave of Russians at a university in America. The town is so backward that it still blasts a siren at 10 AM every morning - a holdover from the Cold War. A romance with a black person is taboo not only from a white point of view but also from the black community.<br />A stunning college student, Marina falls in love with David VanSteinn, her professor.  The very married David is not immune to the Marina's lure and this could cause problems in his marriage. Gleb is married to Vera but he has a roving eye and his eye mostly roves toward women with money, which is far more important to him than his marriage. Gleb also has shady dealings with organized crime in Russia. A black policeman has fallen for Vera even though he doesn't really know her. When he takes her to visit his black church, he receives less than a warm welcome. Vlad and Nina seem to have a solid marriage but there are insecurities on both sides. Nina is rather plain and chubby and Vlad works all the time. Because he notices how flaky his friends are when it comes to relationships he wonders if Nina is straying.<br />The novel has its moments of suspense and drama. The people are almost too real as we follow them through their various relationships. There is an urge to tell them to stop and think about what they are about to do, not only to themselves but their respective partners. It was a very interesting novel and gave some insight into another culture.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-03

Both can impart a thrilling suspense or a<br />dreadful prolonging.<br />Ms. Dupree stresses that how we wait is dependant on what or whom we<br />are waiting for and how we utilize the time. It can be a time of rest<br />and enjoyment or we can make ourselves weary with worry, wondering how<br />long we will remain in limbo. And if we are seeking a reply from God,<br />then the anxiety will certainly be more pronounced. But the one<br />assurance is that we will recieve an answer, it will be 'yes', 'no',<br />or 'wait'. What we have to believe is that when the Lord tells us to<br />wait, he has something great in store.<br />This book is written to help those who are waiting for the fulfillment<br />of a promise from God. It is her prayer that through her testimony<br />readers will be encouraged, strengthened and challenged. Ms. Dupree<br />believes if someone can learn from her experiences and avoid the<br />pitfalls that ensnared her, then her living will not be in vain.<br />Special attention has been given to those who are waiting for a<br />promised mate. She readily cautions that as God moves you towards<br />the person He has chosen for you, things may not happen the way you<br />expect them to. But if you look forward expectantly, there will be a<br />reverbrating ring to the words, &quot;What God has joined together...&quot;<br />THOUGH THE VISION TARRY: Waiting for My Promised Mate is a candid<br />and diaphanous testimony of one woman's journey towards the fulfillment<br />of a God given promise of marriage.

Her clearest memory is of being abandoned near garbage cans in an alley. Allison's husband, Thomas, has his own secret life that revolves around a father he doesn't understand. Thomas' father, Pop, is a dedicated preacher who is determined to tell the Indian, Ishi, who walked out of the woods one day, about Christ even though neither understands the language of the other. To Pop it doesn't matter. He shoves the Bible in Ishi's face, waves his arms around and shouts about the Lord. Mrs. Whitson who is wealthy, arrogant and obnoxious, is into controlling everyone and every situation.<br />Risking disgrace and ostracism, Allison secretly learns Ishi's language and he begins telling her a long story that he heard from his now extinct people. He tells her he is compelled to tell her the story so that it won't die when he does but will live on as his people would want. As Ishi tells his story, Mrs. Whitson finds out Allison speaks Ishi's language and forbids her to talk with him again. After all, a decent white woman would not get that close to a savage. Thomas, who works for Mrs. Whitson, is forced to go along with her demands. Ishi becomes ill and is close to death. Will Allison and Thomas disobey Mrs. Whitson and let Ishi finish the story?<br />This is a story that can teach many lessons, especially with regard to making assumptions about people you don't know. Some of the secrets you can guess but it doesn't take away from the suspense of the story and the need to hurry to the end. It is a book that gives insight into the plight of Indians in America in 1911 as well the how subjugated women were.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-03-03
Nothing should be this hard	Anthony Banks is the child of an addict who is forced to take care of himself almost from the time he was born. He, his mother and aunt live in crack houses and anywhere else they can crash. Frequently, if they have a legitimate place to live, they are summarily evicted since every check from welfare or social services goes for the next fix. Lights, heat and food are rare for the young boy and he has to depend on the kindness of friends and strangers to survive day to day. As a result, he often strikes out in anger and pain, beating up anyone he can. It is not a life anyone would wish to have under any circumstance. But there is something deep within Anthony, a goodness that makes him seek a way out of his tumultuous life.<br />LIVING 2 MANY LIVES is a narrative of Anthony Banks' life and includes the poems he pens.

Tangled web	Anita Bunkley introduces her readers to Kira Forester, a journalist who has just returned from a special assignment in Africa.  Upon her return, she learns that her only living blood relative - a six-year old niece, Vicky - is up for adoption after her foster mother dies.  This revelation leads her to Sheltering Hearts owner Evan Conley, the person responsible for placing Vicky with the adopting family.  Kira decides that although she cannot personally adopt Vicky, she would still like to have contact with her.  However, her request does not come without opposition from the adopting family who happens to be white and wealthy.  They believe her motive is strictly monetary and are adamant about making sure Kira isn't granted visitation rights.<br />Ralph Roper, a wealthy mayoral candidate in Monroeville, NC, is causing quite a stir with his political campaign, business practices and pending adoption of Vicky.  It is believed that the adoption of a black child is merely to boost his black votes.  Frank Thompson, his opponent and the first African-American in Monroeville running for mayor, sets out to show Ralph's true colors and to win the mayoral vote.<br />Kira, Evan, Ralph and Frank each become deeply involved in the political campaign and the adoption proceedings.  Each is on a mission to win.  They end up in a tangled web that leads to deception, disharmony and eventually turns into love...for some.<br />RELATIVE INTEREST was a very slow read.  Although the story is a fascinating one, it took too long for the plot to develop.  However, Bunkley still maintains her ability to keep the reader intrigued with her knack for storytelling.  There is an important message about chosing what you love over whom you love and I'd recommend it to others.	2004-02-01

Searching for Mr. Right	Is finding Mr. Right turning into a trail of Mr. Wrongs? Do marriage and family seem unattainable? Does your significant other always have an excuse for not popping the question? These are just some of the questions that frustrate many single women who have marriage on their minds.<br />CONFESSIONS OF AN EX-BACHELOR: HOW TO SIFT THROUGH ALL THE GAME PLAYERS TO FIND MR. RIGHT reveals what goes on inside the minds of men when women and commitment issues are involved. Each chapter seems to dissect the stages of bachelorhood and shares why men have a need for freedom and how they view women in general. But the author does not stop there, he gives women a wealth of suggestions on how to meet men and ideas on how to keep them interested. He has also included journal writing activities and surveys that force women to look at themselves to determine what they want in a mate and what they will not tolerate in a relationship.<br />CONFESSIONS OF AN EX-BACHELOR: HOW TO SIFT THROUGH ALL THE GAME PLAYERS TO FIND MR.RIGHT is informative and thought provoking. The author speaks from experience and what he writes will capture reader's attention.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
Fully Figured Lyrical Gems	Michelle J. Pinkard is a brilliantly talented new voice in the AA community.  In her volume THE EYE OF THE TORNADO; FIFTY POEMS FOR RHYME AND REASON, she blesses the world with her thoughts and feelings on life and all it encompasses.  Rocking to its own beat, Pinkard's writing comprises of slow, graceful dedications; quick, sassy descriptions; deep, rhythmic sociologies; and sweet, passionate romances.  Divided into five weather-related sections, these lyrical gems provide comedy, encouragement, wisdom, compassion, and a sense of connection. Her poems make you say, \\"Hey, that's me! I've been there, too,\\" or \\"Wow, I never thought of that before.\\"<br />There are so many poems in this book that I simply adore.  A few of them are \\"Fully Figured\\", \\"One day wiser at the pond\\", \\"Do we love us anymore\\", \\"I've seen God\\", \\"Letter to a college friend\\", and \\"To a special black woman.\\"  The life lessons presented in these pages have given me inspiration.  Her eloquent, energetic command of the English language drove me to read and reread until my appetite for exceptional poetry had been temporarily sated. I love how she connected the title with the sections, metaphorically building on the theme of tornadoes and other weather phenomenons while sharing her thoughts on various themes within the big tornado of life. THE EYE OF THE TORNADO is a definite treat for any reader; a book that I will pick up again and again.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
Prayer changes things	Like water to a man dying of thirst, so is GRIP THE ROPE: PRAYERS FOR SINGLE MOTHERS to the single mother.  Carla J. Curtis has put together a treasure trove of prayers aimed at assisting single mothers in an often times one-sided battle to raise their children.  She literally reached within her own life and her relationship with God to pull together prayers for the single mom to cover concerns they face from A - Z.  Each prayer is led by a verse from the Bible showing God's word on the subject.  She left no stone unturned and covered things like burnout, enthusiasm, loneliness, oppression, and time management, to name a few.<br />From a scant eighty pages, I found a tool to assist with me the emotions and issues that abound in my life on this journey as a single parent.  Ms. Curtis also reminds us that prayer is a handy and readily available weapon to fight off the attacks of Satan.  What is so unique about this book is that just reading the prayers added a great source of encouragement to me.  They are some simple yet awesome prayers that can benefit all people, not just single mothers.  Curtis is to be commended for a very timely and handy reference tool.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

A House Full	NO ROOM tells the story of Rob Calloway, a successful businessman, father of ten children, well respected community figure (even among whites) and the grandson of a former slave.  He has spent most of his life living in Callowaytown, a small rural community in North Carolina that is essentially a self-supporting and all black community named after his ancestors.  Still the horrors of the Jim Crow South are inescapable for Rob and his family.  For example, he wants his children to have a good education but they are faced with the challenges of segregated and distant schools and a county that refuses to provide transportation.  When they go into Flaterton, the closest thing to a nearby city, they must endure the fear and humiliation that often accompanies \\"Separate but Equal\\" facilities and poor racist individuals.  However, Rob doesn't let these hurdles hold him back; he is the pillar of his family and the local black community.  As the story unfolds, we follow Rob through a variety of events, ranging from mundane daily tasks to emotionally charged dramatic occurrences.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but I think I would have enjoyed it more had there been more dialogue, because at times it seemed like the narrative dragged on and on and was a bit hard to follow.  In addition, there were times when the story seemed repetitive and at other times too brusque.  Some may find the language used in the book difficult to stomach, but I think it was included to reflect the time period in which the story took place and to add authenticity. I was also disappointed by the somewhat abrupt ending of the book.  But Mr. Lorca's writing really took me back in time; I felt like I was experiencing the book, not just reading it.  It is because of this, that in spite of the book's shortcomings, it was still an enjoyable read.  NO ROOM is the first book in a trilogy; I look forward to reading the next installment and seeing growth in this author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerse RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01

A Day in the Life	Told in a series of diary entries, ALMOST 18 is a short but interesting look into the innermost thoughts of a seventeen year-old girl named Juliet Lee.  Juliet is beginning her senior year in high school and from the start it is a year wrought with many ups and downs, big changes and even bigger choices.  As the school year begins, she is placed in a more advanced track of classes and has to adjust to a more demanding workload while making plans for college.  To make matters worse, because of her new classes, she is separated from her friends and forced to become a part of a new peer group.  On the home front, Juliet is still coping with the death of her father and forced to confront the reality of her mother's mortality as her mom copes with an illness that the two of them have failed to discuss in any detail.  On top of all that, she is dealing with romantic feelings that she doesn't quite understand and learning to cope with both the attention of and rejection from other boys.<br />With rather mature themes, this book may be inappropriate for some young readers because it deals with such topics as sex, abortion, and substance abuse.  However, more mature young readers are sure to embrace this book for it's earthy feel and it's sense of \\"realness.\\"  Adults, especially parents, may also enjoy this read because it truly provides a window into the minds of young teens and captures the essence of their thoughts and feelings.  The author does an excellent job developing the sense of teen angst that is not uncommon for girls at this age of transition and helping readers understand it.  Telling a story through a series of diary entries is not an easy task, but the author pulled it off seamlessly and effectively.  I recommend this book and look forward to future work from this author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay....	2004-02-01
Washington has its politicians and its vampires	In his first novel, Frederick Louis Richardson takes us on a journey that spans more than two hundred years in BLACK RUSH. The journey begins in 1750 on a slave ship crossing the Atlantic that shipwrecks on an island in the Caribbean.  The only survivor would continue a bloodline that eventually comes to reside in the United States.  The Zacharias family, now living in Washington, DC is a very close-knit and unique family.  They carry a disease called porphyria, which is a blood disorder that could cause them to bleed to death. They are also a clan of vampires living and feeding in the Nation's capitol. They can turn a simple act of love into a truly painful and final experience.  As scientists and industrialists are trying to harvest their blood for further study and possible ill gain, the clergy wants good to prevail over evil and the government wants all traces of them extinguished.  There are also those from the Caribbean that want the whole race eradicated, but for other reasons.  In a fight for their very survival, Isaiah \\"Black Rush\\" Zacharias is leading the children of darkness to rid them of all their enemies.  Who will triumph in the end?<br />In this classic tale of good versus evil, Richardson has put a different spin on vampire stories in this horror yarn.  He blends a story about black vampires from Africa, a tale of cornering the market on the world's blood supply and witchcraft with a governmental cover-up to produce a story with some remarkable believability in some parts.  In others, it was a little far-fetched.  Although I had an issue with some of the editing, this is one to read for all you lovers of vampire stories.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Missing Pieces	Eleanor Taylor Bland is gifted at bringing all of her subplots to a head. WHISPERS IN THE DARK is the best yet illustration of this talent.  Marti McAllister, the only black female cop in the town of Lincoln Prairie, Illinois, is back on the case. This time, Marti and her endearing partner Matthew &quot;Vik&quot; Jessenovik are called out to the scene when an arm is found in the weeds. Marti and Vik have to &quot;piece together&quot; the clues to find out not only why the arm turned up, but, more importantly, the identity of its once owner.<br />Meanwhile, Marti's best friend Sharon has gotten herself in a hairy situation when she marries a man she hardly knows. Sharon is then taken to a remote location in the Bahamas for the so-called honeymoon, but it turns out she's gotten into more drama than she bargained for. This mistake could cost her her life and that of her daughter Lisa.<br />I find that Bland adds a human element to the stories that is unparalleled.  Not only does she provide a fabulous mystery, but she also gets the reader attached to all of the characters, both new and recurring. I look forward to many more moving McAllister mysteries.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
Divine Intervention	We've all heard horror stories about life behind bars, but Azarel brings these rumors to a harsh reality in her novel A LIFE TO REMEMBER.  The narrator, Divine Jones, came from a decent upbringing, good education, and decent job.  He was the model of affluence, working in the financial sector until he started hanging with the wrong crowd and got caught up in illegal activities.<br />Now Divine and his buddy Niko are paying for their sins in a state penitentiary - to the tune of twelve years.  In the fashion of true brothers, Divine and Niko look out for one another in the prison.  That is, until a murder is committed and the truth about what Divine agreed to after the trial that put him and Niko away comes to light. It seems that Divine made a deal with the judge to snitch on Niko in order to reduce his sentence. Niko, a strong and rough brother, is not happy about this discovery, and soon Divine's life becomes an even worse nightmare.<br />The rapes, the shanks, the drugs, the beatdowns that take place in the prison where A LIFE TO REMEMBER takes place are vividly portrayed. Azarel constructs her narrator well, and the reader feels sympathy, empathy, and outrage at the things he endures. The book reminded me of the HBO series Oz, translated into prose.  A LIFE TO REMEMBER is certainly not a book I will soon forget.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
From the mouths of babes	THE VILLAGE POET AND COLLECTION OF WRITINGS is a series of stories and a play written when Leon Newton was about ten years old. The stories and the play show an amazing amount of knowledge, caring and kindness for a child so young. In the play, Emperor Titus is rather taken with himself, arrogantly referring to himself as the great emperor. He is also very loyal to his Chief Administrator because he had been a good administrator to the emperor's father. His son attempts to get him to see how corrupt the Chief Administrator is but his advice falls on deaf ears. The results, of course, are predictable.<br />In his short story \\"The Newspaper Boy,\\" Newton successfully illustrates what is important in life. He shows us that it is not money, fame or worldly success, but what we do as human beings for others less fortunate than us. He also deals with the issue of racism in America and how debilitating it really is to all concerned.<br />It is amazing how appropriate his writings are for today's America. If only all of us could take his stories to heart the world would be a much better place. It is a short, easy read and well worth the time spent...	2004-02-01
What do cockfights have to do with it?	A half black, half Vietnamese emergency room doctor, Carmen Nguyen, who knows better, gets involved in the affairs of a dying patient, Luke Redstone. Luke, who is suffering from leukemia and has only a short time to live, begs her to go check on his gamecocks that he keeps behind his cabin. When she rides her motorcycle to his house in the woods, she is shot at before she gets close enough to see how the cocks are faring.<br />Another patient, Walter Rios, who is recovering from a rough tumble over a rocky cliff, also becomes entangled in the gamecock affair. Even though Redstone's gamecocks are superior birds that win most of their matches, Rios and Carmen feel there is something else about the birds that make others wish to steal and even kill if necessary to obtain the cocks. Their path crosses that of a ruthless businessman, a cadre of killers, several scientists and a group of Navajos who have somehow become involved.<br />Much to the disgust of Nguyen's Vietnamese aunt who is not fond of American men, a romance begins to build between Rios, a guilt-ridden white water rafting guide and Nguyen. Nguyen is torn between pleasing her aunt and her love for Rios. There is plenty of background on Carmen's Vietnam beginnings and the reasons for Walter's guilt. The mystery plays out in the stunning scenery of the Grand Mesa and over the contaminated grounds of former uranium mines in western Colorado.<br />Robert Greer has written a fascinating mystery that includes science, medicine, murder and romance. It is a wonderful book that holds your attention to the last page.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01

It seems that one of the men Johnny McAllister helped to put behind bars has an agenda to avenge the wrong he felt was done to him by the system, by the world, and, namely, by Johnny McAllister.<br />Marti and her partner Vik are also reunited with a child from one of their previous cases.

Changing Times	STAGES OF A WOMAN is a collection of short stories that highlight the various stages of life which all females pass through in the process of living.  The book begins with a section on growing up, which features a heart-wrenching story about a young girl who is the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of one of her teachers.  The story tells not only of the harmful effect this abuse had on the main character's psyche, but also of the arduous process she must endure in order to heal.  In another story entitled \\"Finally a Family,\\" we meet KeKe.  From her birth, KeKe has always been rejected by her hard-hearted grandmother because of her grandmother's distaste in her father and more specifically his dark skin color.  As her grandmother enters her twilight years and faces health issues that require special care, it is up to KeKe to decide if she can look beyond the years of mistreatment and see if the two have time left to forge a relationship.  Other stories feature themes such as finding true love, losing a parent, interfering family members, motherhood, abortion and death.<br />In spite of the fact that some of the stories left me wanting more, I really enjoyed this collection.  I would love to see some of the stories expanded into full blown novels.  The author shows her flexibility and creativity by writing stories from varying points of view, some of which were truly unique.  Many of the stories are laced with moral questions that left me reexamining myself and my views.  While some of the stories dealt with heavy issues, Ms. Caldwell throws in dashes of humor at just the right moments to lighten things up.  J.J. Caldwell is truly a writer to watch.	2004-02-01
Star Light, Star Bright	Just as an enormous star shoots across the night sky, John and Patsy grab hands and wish with all their might for the child they can not bear.  Soon after, a beautiful baby girl appears on their doorstep.  They take the child into their home and heart and name her Starla. For years, John and Patsy shower her with more than enough love; yet, it is not enough for their beloved daughter.  She desperately wants a sibling and becomes discontent and lonely. One day, Starla wishes upon a star for special powers that she thinks will comfort her and ease her loneliness.  What she receives, instead, is a hard lesson in pride.<br />Adlai O. Yarbrough fabricates a wonderfully moral tale about a young girl's journey from selfishness to selflessness.  The descriptions he uses to illustrate Starla's body as it metamorphoses into varying grotesque stages are colorful, effective, and easy for children to understand.  Children reading the book will learn the possible effects of pride and the importance of helping others. I enjoyed the story line in CHED; however, the abundance of grammatical errors would keep me from purchasing this book for any child. I also did not care for the 60+ pages of inconsequential pictures and drawings located at the back of the book.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
Family Ties	The day I received Jessica Tilles' latest novel, IN MY SISTERS' CORNER, I decided to read a couple of chapters before bed.  A little over three hours later, I had devoured the entire book and was hungry for more.<br />IN MY SISTERS' CORNER immediately catapulted me in the drama infused world of the Howard sisters.  Free is the oldest and mother-like figure.  She has taken it upon herself to keep her sisters in line no matter what it takes.  China is the married mother of two.  Her domineering husband and her \\"too-grown\\" kids make her life a struggle.  Jade is successful, yet sexually confused.  One moment she cannot have enough  men, then the next moment she is a lesbian.  Maya, the youngest sister, moved to California with dreams of becoming an actress, but instead ended up with a pimp.<br />Jessica Tilles' sophomore novel is an instant hit.  The story follows seemingly different women, bound only by their familial ties, as they cope with life and love.  It follows their ups and downs and shows that no matter what curves life may throw, they are always in their sisters' corner.  Tilles combines well-developed characters with an intriguing storyline that has a hint of suspense, a little romance, and a great deal of drama. I highly recommend this novel and cannot wait to see what this author comes up with next.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
He will give you the desires of your heart	Have you ever loved someone that you never had?  This is the theme around which PROMISES BEYOND JORDAN by Vanessa Davis Griggs was written.  Reverend George Landris is the charismatic pastor of the Wings of Grace Faith Ministry Church in Birmingham, Alabama.  As the story begins, Pastor Landris is about to marry Theresa Jordan in a few days.  He has had some urgings from the church membership that it was time for him to get a wife.  Theresa is everything a Pastor could possibly need in a wife or at least his congregation thinks so.  They appear to be perfect for one another.  But, they each have secrets that begin to unravel and drive a wedge between them just days before the wedding.  They both begin to see a side of the other that neither realized was there and it brings into question their commitment to each other.<br />In this suspenseful Christian love story there are several lessons to be learned.  Ms. Griggs did a fantastic job of relaying them all to the reader.  She brought up several questions that are tackled at one time or another in daily Christian living.  What is the face of true love?  Should a person deny himself to make others happy?  When should one listen to the desires of his/her heart?  How does a minister live his life free from the influence of his parishioners?  When your honor is at stake, should you throw integrity out the window?  Can emotional scars be healed?  These are just a few of the questions dealt with in this astonishing story.  Griggs did an excellent job of answering them through her cast of characters.  This book was hard to put down and it's one I would recommend highly to both men and women.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01

One In the Same	DIFFERENT TREES FROM THE SAME ROOT by Cheril N. Clarke take us back into the lives of Walter, Rachel, Christina and Sheila with a new character,  Deliah \\"Journey\\" Noble, added to the mix along with several other secondary characters.  The aforementioned characters first appeared in Clarke's debut novel Foundations and while it is not absolutely necessary to read that novel, because Clarke does an excellent job of revisiting, Foundations is a good prelude to the awakening of the characters you will find in DIFFERENT TREES FROM THE SAME ROOT.<br />DIFFERENT TREES FROM THE SAME ROOT, told in first person, opens with an introduction by Journey; she is as raw as she is real.  Journey, now in her early 40s, was a teenage mother who abandoned her infant daughter and both were left to fend for themselves in life.  Watch as Journey makes a trek through life and find out where she ends up and how.  With the return of Walter, we find his landscaping business thriving and his love life at a standstill.  Add in Walter's love poems and you have a very committed and loving single father.  When we left Rachel in Foundations she was on a mission to find her true self.  Rachel travels to Miami from Silver Spring, Maryland, to New York City and back again only to be faced with the realization of what life holds for her.  Christina, the daughter of wealthy parents, appears again and is as confused as ever as she searches for meaning in a pending relationship and a desire to rekindle a friendship.  All of the characters connect in more ways than one which will definitely surprise the senses.<br />While some scenes are predictable, this is a very emotional, high impact and spiritual novel about fate, self-awareness, the love of self and the ability to carry on as long as you have faith in a higher being.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

The mind does play tricks.	In her sequel to Mama, Please Forgive Me, Toi Moore delves into the repercussions from domestic abuse and it's affect on the family.  MIND GAMES takes up as La Vonne Brown has just finished her ten-year prison sentence for killing her husband, Jonathan. Her children, who've been living with their grandmother all this time, are now teenagers with lives of their own.  As La Vonne struggles to rebuild her life, reconnect with her children and deal with her guilt, her mind begins to play games on her.  She starts to see a man resembling her dead husband.  These visions begin to wreak havoc in her life as she convinces herself that a conspiracy is in order and now her husband is out to kill her.  But, is this really the case?<br />The fallout from living in an abusive relationship can be devastating on a family, especially if there are children involved.  Ms. Moore gives a fascinating and suspenseful account of the aftermath of domestic violence and I was sucked in right up until the ending.  However, the ending took an unbelievable twist that left me wondering if my mind was playing tricks on me.  Although I never dreamed it would end in such a fashion, I would still recommend this novel.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
The beat of a different drummer	[ostinato]: a musical figure repeated persistently at the same pitch throughout a composition. -- Webster<br />Wanda Coleman has been dubbed the unofficial poet laureate of Los Angeles and with OSTINATO VAMPS she continues the traits that have been her hallmark for more than three decades. Her style is lyrically breathtaking as she repeatedly weaves voices and snippets of blues lyrics into poetic expressions that focus on the human struggle. Her words do both, explore familiar territory and shatter stereotypes, but her fidelity to the truth is buffered by the syncopated way she delivers. The poetry and prose possess a soaring openness and a biting wit, where socially imposed fate begins to burn in the reader's mind at the indifference of humankind. The empty sadness in the title 'Olio Intaglio', where a mother is left to suffer alone over the loss of her son, touches on how family and friends can be the cruelest of them all.<br />One caption refers to her as the poet with a warrior voice because of her inclination to peel away polite veneer and verbally dissect the heart of issues. She artfully reminds us that life is unfair, but it still belongs to the living. If you have a penchant for poetry that is rhythmic but not rhyming, that reaches to the core of a psycho-social America, I recommend OSTINATO VAMPS. It invites the mind to venture beyond its comfort zone.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01
When we practice to deceive.	In this captivating tale of deceit and betrayal, we are introduced to Reginald Brooks who has seemingly mastered the art of living a double life.  On one hand, he is a devoted family man with a wife of 18 years and two children.  On the other hand, he lives with his much younger girlfriend and their six-year-old daughter.<br /><br />After six years, the stress of trying to keep both lives separate is eating away at Reginald, so he decides it's time to choose which life he wants to live.  After making his decision, he comes to realize that exposing his secret does not bring the peaceful resolution he was expecting.  Instead, it opens up a chasm of lies and deceit so deep that it's anybody's guess who, if anyone, will escape unscathed.<br /><br />Like an F5 tornado, THE GREAT PRETENDER sweeps you deep into its vortex, drawing you into this enthralling tale of secrets, secrets and even more secrets.  With a surprise ending that is so intense, you will be left slack-jawed and wondering why you didn't see it coming.<br /><br />Look out literary world!  Millenia Black, a very prolific mystery writer, has hit the scene as a force to be reckoned with.  THE GREAT PRETENDER is a wonderful debut novel and I highly recommend this to readers everywhere.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-02-01

You can run�	You can run...<br /><br />In THE LAST AND FINAL KING the reader follows the life of Noel Bodie, a protagonist who believes his life is normal.  He marries his high school sweetheart, Ruby.  Uncertainty about his life's goals leads him to join the U.S. Air Force.  Shortly after his first tour of duty, he gets order that he is being transferred to Germany.<br /><br />In Germany, Noel's life begins to change drastically.  His wife immediately relocates there with him.  They are lucky in finding suitable housing at an affordable price, especially since Americans are usually charged outrageous rates since it's believed they can afford it.  After settling into their new apartment, Ruby begins to spend a lot of time with their landlord - Anna M&uuml;ller a.k.a. Mighty Red.  Unusual events begin to take place, but Noel doesn't realize that each has significance.  That is, until he meets Lillian Doss, the woman who tells him of his striking resemblance to the past leader of an organization called Siene Kinder.  He is told that he is believed to be the returned Messiah - THE LAST AND FINAL KING.  After a failed attempt on his life (by his wife) Lillian also reveals that Mighty Red is the leader of the opposition that wants him killed and his wife's attempt on his life may have resulted from her being drugged.<br /><br />Ordinarily one would think a man would jump at the opportunity to lead an entire people.  It's comparable to one reaching their level of self-actualization.  However, Noel isn't ecstatic about the possibility.  Instead he chooses to flee Germany, goes into hiding, changes his identity and becomes Al Pearson - in hopes to stay alive.  Does it work or does he learn that you can run but you can't hide?  Will he eventually accept his reign as the new Messiah?<br /><br />Author Obi's writing is very poetic and flows nicely.  THE LAST AND FINAL KING was an interesting read, but I'm still trying to figure out the significance of his elaboration on all the steamy sex scenes.  Other than knowing the important role of the women he had sex with, I didn't feel the scenes were a necessity.  Perhaps they were indicative of his being a king?  Regardless, I'd still recommend this book.<br /> ...than knowing the important role of the women he had sex with, I didn't feel the scenes were a necessity.

Love is a splendid thing	Robert Fleming has put together a wonderful collection of erotica written by<br />some of the hottest African American male writers of today.  Ranging in<br />temperature from lukewarm to steamy hot, INTIMACY has something for everyone.<br />The stories are rich in detail and plot making them much more than the<br />average erotic tale.  Each writer has his own style which gives great<br />versatility to the entire text.<br />As I read each story,  I was hard-pressed to choose a favorite especially,<br />since each one touched me in some way.  When I first picked up INTIMACY, I was<br />prepared to be pulled into a deluge of oversexed passages and encounters.<br />Instead, I was treated to stories about relationships and couples dealing with<br />issues while loving one another in the most passionate and intimate ways.  Of<br />course things got racy at times, but it was done in style and woven into a<br />pleasing tale.  INTIMACY is a thoroughly satisfying volume of erotica from the<br />male perspective.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-27
The Sight�	In a world of the unseen, The Mobleys are plagued by gifts that are not privy to the norm.  Grace, Mary Nell and Eva, the daughters of Frank and Joy, are constantly driven to odds against the world.  Amongst shattered dreams and stolen moments, the three girls are brought full circle through turbulence, turmoil and adulthood.<br />Mary Nell and Eva share the sight of knowing the future.  As little girls, they were inseparable; from the bed they slept in, to every waking thought.  The painful process of growing up leads them through a whirlwind of events:  Mary Nell gets married to the town's bad boy, her husband rapes her sister Eva at thirteen and Eva gets pregnant and has a baby.  Although Mary Nell witnessed the rape with her own \\"sight\\", she still blames Eva for her husband's disloyalty.  After being raped, Eva is never the same and longs for the same sisterhood bond she shared with Mary Nell.  Through all of this turmoil, Mary Nell develops a deep-seated resentment and steals the very same baby from Eva that she could never give her own husband, developing a life of hatred and bitterness towards Eva.<br />Grace, the oldest, has the gift of knowing the past.  Through this gift, she experiences hardship and pain, as the spirit of her dead great-grandmother Bessie and her alter-ego Ayo completely engulf her on a regular basis.  Not only does the spirit give her insight and depth of the struggles she endured as a slave while in Africa and the States, Grace also has the ability to feel the same pain as her grandmother did, complete with scars, blood and bruises.  Grace gets married, has kids and tries to move on, but eventually has to leave everything behind, trying to run from the one thing that has always had full rein over her life...<br />Phyllis Alesia Perry does an excellent job of giving a true-to-life depiction of how the myth of having \\"the sight\\" may actually be true.  A SUNDAY IN JUNE is a well-written, captivating story with depth, feeling and compassion.  The characters portrayed in this novel are finely-tuned, keeping the readers entranced within the story.

The musings of a postmodern girl	Too hip to be existential but filled with age old truths, SWERVE by Aisha Tyler<br />is a commentary on maintaining a sense of self while trying to weather the<br />often cold dating climate.  It is packed with clever anecdotes, personal<br />accounts, and common sense rules for preserving dignity in the face of trying<br />to hook the hot guy at the end of the bar without appearing to be a harlot.<br />Tyler begins with a basic definition of postmodernism and then she flips it<br />and tells what it means to her.  She goes on to discuss how she doesn't know<br />if SWERVE is postmodern or not. She began writing it with the idea of sending<br />a helpful message to women. What she ended up with was a witty observation of<br />life, dating, and self-esteem. Her humorous slant on the subject matter keeps<br />it from being a self-help book, but her many descriptions and stories will<br />undoubtedly lead readers to identify with some characterizations in the book.<br />With chapters titled \\"The Ballad of The Yogurt Girl\\" and \\"The War of Art, or<br />Aiken v. Studdard in the World Series of Love\\", Tyler is entertaining and<br />truthful in her depictions of people at work and at play.  Many times the<br />chapters read like a conversation that Tyler was having with a friend - one<br />that started off on one subject, but ended up somewhere else entirely - and it<br />still managed to hold my attention.  Where else can you find, in one chapter,<br />a discussion of people mimicking the personalities of Ruben Studdard and Clay<br />Aiken at a karoke bar and end up with a discussion of The Art War as it relates<br />to dating?<br />Using language that is spoken by those in their twenties, Tyler addresses issues<br />that have long been debated in sociology classes and in bars throughout the<br />country. How does a girl land a hot guy, beat out the competition and maintain<br />her dignity?  What does a woman do when she has made a fool of herself during<br />her quest for a man?  These as well as a multitude of other topics are<br />among those touched on by Tyler.  Her underlying message is to be yourself in<br />the face of any dating or social disaster and all will be fine in the<br />end.  Regardless of the subject that Tyler flows to, she is entertaining and<br />has put together a book that is simply fun and amusing.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersother topics are<BR>among those touched on by Tyler.

She shares things such as loving yourself first, not giving up on yourself, sticking to your values, choosing battles wisely, knowing your past, and a host of other lessons.

Sisterly Bonds	The Cates are one of the richest and most prominent families in the small town of Peoria, Illinois. Gracely, Rebecca and Claudia are the daughters of a powerful businessman and his beautiful, genteel wife. When they were young women they wanted no parts of Peoria, but as mature women in their 50's there is no place they would rather be. They now appreciate the influence and power they wield in the community.<br /><br />On the surface the Cates sisters appear to be happy, but they could not be further from the truth, they are all in unfulfilling marriages. And recently they have began to feel that life has dealt them a cruel hand. They are saddled with sick, helpless husbands who make their lives miserable. Frustrated and yearning for better days, they decide that committing their husbands to institutions is the best solution for all involved. They concoct a plan to dump the men, but they must do it in a manner that will not affect their upstanding images in the community.<br /><br />LAELIA by Ruth Miriam Garnett is full of surprises, it is entertaining and a bit outrageous. And though the characters are middle aged women, I believe that people of all ages will appreciate and enjoy this story.<br /><br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Touching on a broad range of subjects centering on the aspects of our daily lives, the authors have given an insightful glance into relationships, what makes them tick, and the joys and heartaches that can result from them.  Not only do they cover relationships between lovers, but also those between family members, and friends.<br /><br />SCATTERED PIECES is a wonderful title for this multifarious read that is one of my favorites of short stories I've read.  My only dissatisfaction came in knowing that some of the pieces were only short stories vs full blown novels.  I look forward to seeing more work from this duo as well as reading individual work they may produce.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-25
Bloom	Falling back on the romantic notion of old-fashioned love, Linda Dominique Grosvenor presents the second book in The Craddle Robbers series, BLOOM.  Lily Manchester is a divorced flower shop owner who has established herself in her community, gotten through her past hurts, and is content with her life. Yet when she meets Alex, a handsome substitute delivery man twelve years her junior,  her world changes and she begins wondering what the future could bring.  On top of this, her ex-husband returns to town wanting to re-claim the spot in her life he forfeited 11 years ago when he entered into the military and after a brief time stopped all communication with her.  She also has a town busy-body dipping into her business and spouting unsolicited words of warning regarding the potential relationship with Alex.<br />Lily deliberates back and forth over her feelings for Alex and her ex-husband and in the process comes to term with her fears, her insecurities, and what's important to her.  She even manages to face the impact of being deserted by her husband so long ago.  Alex, on the other hand, also comes to terms with some of his flaws, yet he's not willing to let Lily go.  The relationship that evolves is beautiful, inspiring, and sweet, but how will the town of Bliss, North Carolina, adjust to an older woman dating a younger man?<br />Grosvenor has added another well-written story to her collection of books, but I was left wanting more of &quot;something&quot; from BLOOM to make this more than just an ordinary read.  Even with romance books which are very formulaic, there seems to be some type of conflict for the main characters to go through in order to get to what they're searching for either in their own lives or in their relationships.  With BLOOM, I loved the author's writing, the flow of the book, and the overall premise, but I simply wanted more.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-25
Independent or not?	In LIVIN' JUST ENOUGH, author Lea Mishell introduces readers to Rachel, aka Baby Girl, a young woman caught up in the game of life, her ex-boyfriend Aaron, and her new boyfriend Alonzo.  This is a tale of love lost (or at least something imitating love), love found (or at least something that'll do in a crunch), and a promise made that must be kept.<br />Caught at an early age in a life of relying on a man to provide<br />for her, Baby Girl is at a loss when Aaron is sent to prison.  He casually and cruelly tells her to do what she has to do in order to keep his apartment.  When she balks at the thought of sleeping with the landlord, Aaron tells her to be out of his place by the time he returns from prison.  Baby Girl puts on a brave front and is convinced that she can make it on her own; that is until Alonzo shows up.  He offers her everything Aaron did in the past, except he throws in a bit of respect, charm, and love.<br />Re-enter Aaron.  He's on the way home from prison and has sent money to Baby Girl to get everything &quot;ready&quot; for his arrival (and his claim back in her life), but she's convinced she's through.  So, she plans to take the money to his grandmother whom she has grown to care for and has stayed in touch with through his imprisonment.  Bad move!  Unbeknownst to her, Aaron arrives home that very same day. He comes home to find Big Mama on her deathbed and her dying wish is that Baby Girl forgives Aaron and that they get married.  In an effort to ease Big Mama's mind, Baby Girl agrees.  One can only imagine what happens next.  Does Baby Girl keep her promise?  Does Alonzo just let go?  Does Aaron shape up and fly right?<br />LIVIN' JUST ENOUGH is an interesting enough story, told in an easy to read manner, but I was quite turned off by Baby Girl's road to &quot;independence&quot;.  In my mind, she never really grew up or handled her own responsibilities.  She went straight from Aaron taking care of her to Alonzo resuming the role.  This takes away a bit of the moral to the story for me and along with a few other things, makes the story seem far-fetched and unbelievable.  Nonetheless, the dialogue was entertaining, the relationship with Big Mama was endearing, and the ending (while a bit predictable), was quite interesting.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A flight to marriage	Wickedly funny and wonderfully told, BAGGAGE CLAIM is a divine debut into the literary world by playwright David E. Talbert.  Montana Moore is not only a flight attendant, but she's carrying enough baggage for two or three other people: baggage in her personal life and also in her family life.  She is 35 years old and on a mission to find her a husband in 30 days or less using her connections to fly the friendly skies.<br />The women in Montana's family are obsessed with the idea of marriage and have come up with a ridiculous tradition of putting pressure on any woman nearing thirty who remains unmarried.  Montana's the only one left and the noose around her neck starts to tighten as her mother just finalized her fourth marriage and her sister unexpectedly announces her engagement.  Montana loses all sane thoughts, dismantles her theory of men and their similarity to various pieces of baggage, and gathers her flying buddies Sam and Gail for a master plan.<br />Sam and Gail have major work to do, but manage to reinvent Montana and get her ready for the flight of her life, as they go through her address book selecting men who will make marriage material for her.  After checking the airline schedules, they are able to find out when the men will be taking flights for the holidays and in order to make the project work, Montana is set up to &quot;accidentally&quot; bump into them.  Imagine it.  Five different men, in five different cities across the United States; all with a history.  From an imitation P.Diddy to a spineless minister, to a wealthy millionare and an attorney, she hopes to find &quot;the one&quot; who will help her break the &quot;Moore Family Curse&quot; and arrive at her sister's engagement party with an announcement of her own.<br />Getting from point A to point B in BAGGAGE CLAIM is outright hilarious.  The dialogue of the characters intertwined with the proposterous plan of finding a fiance' by flying through the friendly skies will keep you reading this book from cover to cover.  Talbert has a knack for bringing these characters to life and what a great transformation it was.  I fell in love with some of the protagonists and felt a sense of loss as the story ended.  He did a wonderful job of showing the reader that sometimes traditions are not always what they're cracked up to be and that they should not always determine how you run your life.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

An exciting adventure	When money, sex, and violence converge, you have PUSH by Relentless Aaron.  Reginald \\"Push\\" Jackson is a black man living in Harlem, determined to make a better life for himself, his sister, and nephew.  Spending the better part of his younger years in prison, he's come back to the streets of Harlem with a mission, never to return to prison again.  In spite of this, he also plans to avenge the death of his parents who were brutally murdered when he was a child.  Push will stop at nothing to get what he wants, even if it means taking the risk of getting caught.<br />When politics come into the picture and millions of dollars are available for the taking, the story starts heating up and it doesn't stop until the very last page.  Push is one brotha you don't want to mess with. Reminiscent of movies such as Dead Presidents and Sugar Hill, PUSH is an exciting adventure into the street life of Harlem. The book is real, raw, in-your-face, and graphic!  Relentless Aaron manages to capture the reader and take them on a full-fledged journey into the reality of Push's world.<br />Although it started slow for me, the book turned out suspenseful, engaging, and read as vividly as if I was watching a movie.  In spite of this, the numerous typos, grammatical errors, and structure of the book severely took away from the story.  There are also scenes in the book I felt were too graphic and too demeaning to women, yet I do understand the need to use them to complement the lifestyles and images portrayed, thus fully developing the characters. Relentless Aaron has a certain style that seeps through the aforementioned problems and I'm sure readers of street fiction and true crime stories will enjoy his books.  He's an author I'll definitely be watching.<br />I only hope that readers do not become consumed with the crimes committed and the end result for Push.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Jas is raising his two-year-old daughter alone. Each one needs someone else to be complete but they have no idea how to accomplish that. They dance around each other, afraid to get together because of the pain of their past relationships.<br />Jas and Tayrn's former significant others are horrified when they realize that Jas and Taryn might be getting together. Donald, the rich boy date rapist, suddenly needs his child in order to get his inheritance. Dianne, who never wanted a child in the first place, now needs her to collect child support. What will come of all these run-away needs? That's where the suspense comes in.<br />This was a very interesting, well thought out book that could have been much better with a bit of editing. The changing of tense and grammatical errors definitely take away from a very interesting plot. In spite of the mechanical issues, the book is still worth reading.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-25
Beautiful, but missing something	If you're looking for a beautiful, decorative coffee-table book to fill space in your living quarters, look no further.  STYLE AND GRACE: AFRICAN AMERICANS AT HOME is a beautiful escape inside the home of African American celebrities.  Showing a diversity of styles and tastes, the reader is given a glimpse of quiet elegance, sophisticated clutter, and even over-indulgent artifacts.  Showcasing the houses of celebrities such as Russell Simmons and Gordon Parks to Nancy Lane and Michael McCollom, this book is resplendent, and quite an inspiration to those who can afford to hire someone else to fix up their house.<br />Photographer Mick Hales has beautifully portrayed areas both inside and outside of each house.  And, while I did think the book was beautiful, it was a bit annoying that it only focused on celebrities as if to say that other African Americans do not have style and decorating abilities too.  It would've been nice to see a section devoted to those who do their own interior decorating.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-25
Secrets, secrets, secrets...	In this intriguing tale of suspense we are introduced to Cara Fleming, a young wife and mother whose life seems to be going along pretty well.  That is, until her husband accuses her of infidelity.  Not understanding why her husband believes \\"the proof\\" he received from an anonymous phone call, Cara sets out to prove her innocence. While on this mission, Cara stumbles upon a family secret that, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the lives of many, including her husband.<br />Full of twists and turns, \\"whodunits\\", mystery and suspense, I found this to be an enjoyable read.  There were some parts of the story, though, that I had to re-read because I was left wondering what happened, causing it to be a bit disjointed.

Emotions from the city	THE VOICES OF SOUTH CENTRAL poetically paints the emotions and issues of the<br />South Central section of Los Angeles.  Charles Chatmon tackles many topics in<br />this volume of verse, which uses the often controversial and misunderstood<br />location as its muse.<br />Politics, racism, love, and discrimination are a few of the featured themes.<br />Written with stark sensitivity and style, the poems give a poignant and real<br />view of life and the circumstances that people face.  Reading THE VOICES OF<br />SOUTH CENTRAL will erase \\"The Boys In The Hood\\" thoughts of South Central and<br />replace them with thoughts of hope and inspiration.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Hill is a college educated young man who is trying to make a difference by teaching.  He does not fit the usual stereotypes that one often sees in the media, depicting Black men in a negative light.  Instead, despite what the title suggests, Hill is an average guy.  The book follows Hill as he experiences true love and heartache while all the time trying to define himself and what he wants to achieve in life.<br />Seay has written a novel that shows men in a positive light and debunks the old myth that \\"nice guys finish last.\\"  He gives a realistic portrayal of the life of a positive, young Black man.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

It is his mission to find legitimate employment, and shy away from the lifestyle that landed him in prison.  When he meets up with his old friend Dawg, his resolve is severly tested.  Will the lure of fast money, fancy homes and expensive cars be too strong for Jamal to resist?<br /><br />In ENTANGLED, author K.

Golf?	Can you imagine a game that involves hitting a little ball into a little hole could be so exciting?  Well, Brian Egeston enters with his novel, THE BIG MONEY MATCH.  Four major money backers put thousands of dollars on the line with four seasoned golfers and what emerges is the golf game of the year.  Each of the golfers is facing disastrous financial situations.  Joi Trottleman is involved in a major embezzlement scheme on her job.  Jeff King is trying to save his brother's life.  Kevin Tanner is broke from a serious gambling problem.  Bob Berry is facing political suicide.  As these players take to the course, who will walk away with the money and what is the cost to the other three?<br />Mr. Egeston masterfully weaves a tale about the lives of four people in trouble around a game of golf in this very well written and compelling story.  Even a greenhorn such as I could understand and follow the game.  His writing style is simply eloquent.  The imagery he uses is exceptional.  I actually felt like I was on the golf course as the game was in progress.  The well-developed characters will evoke a myriad of emotions ranging from love to hate.  This is a great book and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Can you hear the call?	Imagine what would happen if God were calling you today and you could not hear him.  Derek A. Jackson, a newcomer to Christian fiction, has written a novel about heeding God's call in your life.  In DESTINY'S CRY, we meet three individuals who are at crossroads in their lives.  At a young age, Andre Benders is already a husband and father dealing with the disappointment of not being able to take care of his family.  His answer has been more or less to seek solace in the streets.  But he has a praying mother who refuses to give him over to the streets.  Lauren Dillard, a black college student, is trying to find love, but has been looking in all the wrong places.  She is tired of the life she's living but doesn't realize it.  Terrell Robinson was once the Chaplain for the Victory Student Fellowship.  He feels that he has lost touch with God and is clueless as to how to get it back or even if he wants it back.  These three people are obviously in search of something that man cannot give them.  How do they solve the mystery of their lives?<br />Derek A. Jackson has written a powerful and inspirational piece about God's call on our lives and how to answer. We see that God can work divine miracles when a person is at their lowest point in life. He can pull a man from the depths of the streets and a woman from a life of uncertainty and give them each a new joy, if only they would open their hearts to fully receive Him in their lives.  Jackson also shows that it is not that God has deserted us, but that He is waiting to see what we do with the gifts He's given us.  This was truly an inspiring read, one that I would recommend to both believers and nonbelievers.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
THINGS FALL APART	Achebe has spun a classic tale of redemption and tragedy which takes<br />place in the Nigerian village of Umuofia. Readers learn of the tribal<br />rituals and traditions of the Ibo tribe through the eyes of the<br />tragic hero Okonkwo. Okonkwo is obsessed with rising above the<br />shameful legacy his father has bestowed upon the family. He  becomes<br />a champion wrestler, prolific farmer and a stern  husband of three<br />wives and many children. In the eyes of the villagers this gives him<br />respect and importance, redeeming him against the deeds of his<br />father. Yet, there is a dark side to our hero, as a result of his<br />pursuit of acceptance.<br />Okonkwo becomes a cruel man to his wife and children, demanding near<br />perfection from them, so that he is never disgraced. Ironically, it<br />is through a tragic chain of events that he disgraces himself. After<br />years of banishment Okonkwo reenters Nigerian society under British<br />rule. No longer are rituals, traditions and the religion of the<br />forefathers honored. Okonkwo must come to terms with reclaiming<br />respect and importance in a land that has left the old ways behind<br />and is slowly spinning into chaos.<br />Achebe gives the reader a rare glimpse into a pre-colonial Nigeria<br />that is both brutal and beautiful;a Nigeria that had respect for its<br />people and their way of life. THINGS FALL APART is slowly paced, and<br />some readers may become frustrated with flipping to the glossary to<br />find the meaning of some Ibo words. However, the novel is well<br />written and constructed.  Readers who venture into this tale are<br />given a unique glimpse into a traditional African hero standing tall<br />against the onset of Western influence. A special treat.<br />Reviewed by Raven James<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Everybody deceives	In PRIVATE DECEPTIONS, Roy Glenn first treats readers to a short story entitled \\"In Your Arms\\" and later works it into this fast-moving mystery.  Followers of Roy Glenn may remember Nick Simmons, a character from Is It a Crime who turned his back on Vicious Black and joined the military.  Well, that was ten years ago and Nick is now out of the military and a Private Investigator in New York City, or so it would appear. Nick and his team are hired by Gabriel Childers to find her brother, whom she believes has been killed by her husband, Chilly.  In his search to find Jake Rollins, Nick comes face to face with his past from ten years ago.  The investigation takes numerous twists and turns ultimately causing Nick to lose an acquaintance and become wanted by the police for several murders.  As he discusses the sequence of events with Wanda Moore (Is It a Crime), his attorney, all the clues point to some unknown factor working in the shadows against him.<br />Roy Glenn has penned a good mystery that is packed full of stealth reconnaissance, gangster action and a little love on the side.  Glenn does a pretty good job of informing readers about the status of the recurring characters from Is it Crime so that this novel can stand on its own.  However, the constant switching between the past and present served as a point of confusion a few times. Incorporating some of the storyline from the short story served to whet my appetite, as I was looking for a lot more from that story.  Despite the few shortcomings, this was still a pretty good read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
When it�s right	Using the Virgin Islands as its backdrop, JUST AN AFFAIR is a love story about putting it all back together after being hurt and humiliated.  Caryl Walker is an attorney turned sea captain trying to escape the trauma of an affair gone bad with a married man.  Having put that relationship behind her and vowing herself to a year of celibacy, Caryl's life takes an unexpected turn when she meets the handsome and successful Joshua Tain just weeks before her year is up.  Joshua is in the Virgin Islands taking a much-needed break from the manipulative dealings of a corporate raider trying to take over his company.  His itinerary puts him on the Elendil, a chartered boat on which Caryl is the captain.  As she takes him on a tour of the Islands, they become infatuated with each other, making her vow of celibacy hard to continue.<br />As Joshua's vacation ends, both he and Caryl are secretly hoping their liaison was more than just a fling.  An unfortunate diving accident leaves Caryl with short-term amnesia and a man from her past trying to make sure it lasts long enough for him to get what he wants.  Alexander Thorne has divorced his wife, lost most of his financial standing and has promised to make Caryl a part of his life again by any means necessary.  Joshua is just as determined to have Caryl too. He is confident that her memory will return because of what they shared before the accident.  When Alexander and Joshua meet, who will remain standing once the dust has settled?<br />Eugenia O'Neal has constructed an interesting tale of love about a protagonist in a non-traditional role and she's managed to lace the novel with some of the environmental and social concerns of the Virgin Islands.  She's created an interesting cast of well-developed characters, each contributing a unique twist to the story.  I enjoyed this well-rounded novel for its tender view of love conquering all and making me aware of the societal issues prevalent in many countries and not just my own neighborhood.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Mixing professional and personal lives, can it work?	In EVERYBODY GOT ISSUES, V. Anthony Rivers takes an interesting and often comical look at relationships on the job.  In the office, you're likely to work with an assortment of individuals who may have some very deep issues.  There is the ambitious man who will use anybody and any situation to climb the corporate ladder.  There is the consummate professional who always dresses the part, acts a little uppity with the staff, but has a hidden freaky agenda.  Then, there is the young woman from the other side of the tracks with a different outlook and appearance, trying to make it in a world where the cards are stacked against her.  You've just been introduced to Avont&eacute;, Ina, and Nakia, respectively.  The three work for an advertising company. While working with the firm, they develop some interesting associations with each other as well as other employees. They learn that friendships in a professional setting can be threatened by vicious office gossip, petty backstabbing and needling jealousy.<br />Yes, there is drama in the office too.  Professionals can either deal with the drama with aplomb or sadly become a part of it.  Rivers has written a very good book characterizing common everyday office politics and conflicts, which can spill over into our personal lives.  He gives a good case for the need to keep it at a professional level.  Working for a large organization, I could relate to many of the characters' attitudes and issues.

Bling, Bling	LOST IN ATLANTA is an interesting story that follows several young men in their search for lives' meaning and true love.  Brian and Glenn are best friends with a lot of money and they share an attraction to gold digging women.  Both men seem to use their money to attract women and keep them interested.  They quickly learn that when dealing with that type of women it is best to keep their emotions in check because otherwise they may end up with broken hearts.  Malik is a blue collar man with a very lucrative business; however, he develops a hustler type persona because he feels that despite his financial success, women will not respect him if they know his true profession.  He tends to treat women as objects and keeps his heart locked away.  Sean is Glenns younger brother and has fled to Atlanta to start a new life after a series of events force him to leave his hometown.  He falls in love and seems to do well until his past begins to play a game of catch up.  Each of the men come to points in their lives where frivolous relationships are no longer enough to sustain them.  It is at this point that each must go on a journey of self enlightenment and growth.<br />This book started out slowly for me.  It seemed as if the author spent more time describing clothes, jewelry, and cars, and doing high end name brand endorsements than developing the plot.  However, about halfway through the book the name dropping seemed to fade into the background and an intriguing plot took the forefront.  From that point on, the book became more of a page turner for me.  I was suddenly emotionally drawn to the characters and enraptured by the plot.  The story began looking at real relationship issues that both men and women must confront in every day life.  While most of the female characters in the book were portrayed as fairly weak minded and dependent, the few strong female characters were lauded for their positive traits.  I was left wondering what happened to Brian, which was a little disappointing, but I was impressed by the tremendous growth and transformation that Glenn, Sean and Malik realized.  Once the story gets moving, LOST IN ATLANTA is a worthwhile read that will remind readers that sometimes you have to change what you are looking for in order to find the right mate.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerstle disappointing, but I was impressed by the tremendous growth and transformation that Glenn, Sean and Malik realized.

This visit will provide Joske with a dilemma that will surely test her Christian faith.  It would be much simpler if Brinae could believe in forgiveness and move on like Joske has.<br />At an office Christmas party, Joske briefly meets the handsome Paul Mason but the moment is preserved in her memory forever.  For Paul, Joske is the first woman who's garnered his attention in some time, but the appearance of a wedding ring means she's off limits to him.  Unbeknowest to Paul at the time, Joske has been recently widowed.  Being employed by the same company, Paul leaves the party in hopes that his path will cross Joske's again.  Fate and friends conspire to get the two together.  With the imminent arrival of Brinae and Jon, the idea is borne for Joske to pretend she has a man in her life. If Joske appeared unavailable and happy with a new love interest, then Brinae wouldn't feel the need to be insecure around her.  So Joske and Paul contrive a way to appear the happy couple to Brinae and Jon.  The only problem is feelings.  What will happen after the game is over?<br />In THE BOYFRIEND GAME, newcomer Dionne Speight gives us an delightful love story about two people overcoming personal adversity, having a little fun and finding love in the process.

Don�t Judge A Book by Its Cover!	THE ODYSSEY OF THE SECOND PEOPLE by Edward F. Wagner is an interesting take on interpersonal relationships; those of caring, love, a sense of family, and exploration of intimacy.  This sequel to THE SECOND PEOPLE - THE BEGINNING, revolves around the characters of the band leader Anbessa, and his mate Umfazi, their daughter Caraga and a the medicine man known as The Wanderer.  Setting his novel in ancient Egypt, Israel and the surrounding regions, the author is meticulous in selecting names in the story that are authentic.  These names are highlighted to reflect the oneness of a \\"common ancestry\\"  and the meanings of these ancient names are included in the introduction to the story that serves as a reference throughout.<br />As the band grows, they face many struggles of daily survival. Will they learn to grow together in order to continue to thrive?  Will the men accept the women members as their equals?  When difficult decisions arise, what is the band's ultimate decision?<br />This book offers the reader something different in terms of its setting and its approach.

Do you know what motivates you?	How does knowing what motivates you impact your life?  According to Annette Johnson, motivators determine your destiny.  In WHAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION, Ms. Johnson separates our being into four distinct parts and calls them motivators. They are the body, mind, heart and Spirit.  Each of these motivators has certain characteristics that direct a person's behavior.  When applied to certain areas of our lives, the motivators we value most tend to be the overriding factor in our actions.  As an example, Johnson states, \\"The body motivates those who live to satisfy the senses.\\"<br />Ms. Johnson has assembled a very informative guide to analyzing motivation in one's life.  She interjects scriptures from the Bible and her real life experiences to enhance readers' understanding of how motivators work in particular areas of their lives.  She also imparts some knowledge about maintaining proper motivation as you grow spiritually and how to recognize motivators in others.

Fairytales with a twist	BEDTIME STORIES FOR WOMEN are guaranteed to give rise to your senses...and your libido. You will never read fairytales the same way after reading one of these stories.

BEDTIME STORIES FOR WOMEN are told in an eloquent manner that is insatiable; they may even tempt you to want to create your own ending. Curl up with your significant other and prepare to read him a bedtime story. I must warn you that these stories are not meant to put him to sleep, but to wake him instead.

Powerful	In the first of six studies, Bishop Jakes takes the reader on a journey through the first book of Ephesians.  The book opens by providing a history lesson as to the type of people the Ephesians were, and the lifestyles to which they were accustomed.  The books discusses the apostle Paul's relationship to the Ephesians.  It explains that although they were wealthy and enjoyed the finer things in life, the Ephesians were introduced to a different manner of living by Paul.<br />Each chapter of the book of Ephesians is carefully analyzed.  These are reinforced with other Biblical references, as well as narrative that causes the reader to delve further into the Word and provokes further revelation.  This book is small in size, but it is mighty in terms of the message it conveys!<br />The \\"Harmony\\" chapter based on Ephesians  1:4 is my favorite chapter.  It draws parallels between our walk with God and music.  \\"Our destiny is to be harmonious with what God has chosen for us.  Harmony only exists because there is his melody.  In our lives, God is the lead singer!  He sings the melody line, and our role is to harmonize with Him.\\"<br />Once again, Bishop Jakes presents a compelling and educational literary work.  The examples and other references that are used provide greater enhancement and enlightenment to the reader.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Following the tragic death of her son, her husband, District Attorney Josh Williams, publicly humiliated her, divorced her and blamed her for their son's death.  Jillian proved her resilience and made her law firm a success, although the long hours at the practice consumed much of her time for friends, quality time with her family, and dating.  Despite her having little time for socializing, she is proud to help out clients who have been victims of bad police work.  When she witnesses a murder in her office parking garage one night, things turn upside down for her yet again, and she is forced to deal with the same police she has battled in the past.<br />Detective Harrison Blake is leading the investigation into the slain accountant's murder that Jillian witnessed.  His attraction to his witness is instant and electric, in spite of their difference in skin color. When Jillian's life is threatened, Harrison's protective nature kicks in full force as he vows to protect her from the people who want her silenced about the events that took place the night of the murder. In the midst all of the threats, the protection, and the danger, Jillian and Harrison continue to dote on one another.<br />I'LL BE YOUR SHELTER is a great blend of romance and mystery.  The characters are likeable, despite their situation being annoying at times. The plot is fairly fluid and the story moves along at a nice, steady pace. At times the writing seemed a bit awkward, but it didn't detract from the story.  Additionally, I liked how the race issue was addressed and not totally forgotten, as it is an issue interracial couples need to be prepared to deal with. This is a read that lovers of both romance and mystery will find enjoyable and captivating.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
DECISIONS, DECISIONS, DECISIONS	Laine Highsmith's DECISIONS picks up where her first novel Choices left off.  The reader is immediately thrust into the  lives of Raven McNeill, Wesley Charles, and Derrick Kincaide.<br />Raven has drama in all  aspects of her life.  She is trying to adjust to a promotion at work, she is still dealing with the childish antics of Derrick's ex-wife, and she is pregnant and is unsure of her baby's paternity. Derrick is enjoying the bliss of being in love, but he harbors a dark secret that will either strengthen his union with Raven, or forever tear it apart.  Wesley finds himself trying to get over Raven, but is unable to deny his love for her.  He soon discovers that all is not what it appears, and that the bond he shares with Raven runs deeper than either of them could ever imagine.<br />Laine Highsmith has proven that she is on top of her game with her second novel DECISIONS.  The characters are so real and true to life that it was like having a reunion with old friends.  The story flows well, but I will caution that this book does not stand alone.  It is imperative that you read Choices first to fully grasp the history and complexity of the relationships the characters share.  Nonetheless this book is an excellent read that shows how the decisions one makes can alter the course of their life and the lives of those around them.

Plenty of Native American and African American history is uncovered as they search for answers. Along with a very good mystery, we get a marvelous history lesson about the entwined lives of early Native Americans and African Americans. If I had one wish for the book, it would be that the past and present had been tied together in a stronger way at the end. Otherwise, it was a very good read.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Following Your Heart	Captain Jeff Williams is an African American fighter pilot during World War II stationed in China and fighting against the Japanese.  While in China he meets a young Chinese woman named Nulinh who works in her father's store on the military base and there is an immediate attraction between the two.  Since Jeff is in a committed relationship with another woman back home, the two decide to become friends.  In addition, they both realize that their cultural differences would make it difficult for them to pursue a romantic relationship.  However, after a series of difficult events they discover that there may be a chance for love after all.  The war serves as a backdrop for the story and between the battle scenes and the slowly developing story of forbidden love, this story has a wide reaching appeal.<br />For the most part I enjoyed this story, but the pace of the book lacked continuity.  There were times early in the book when I felt the story dragged along, but the last 100 pages seemed more like a race to finish the story and tie up loose ends in the plot.  As a result, the relationship between Nulinh and Jeff was slow getting started but then seemed to progress unrealistically.  The author did an excellent job providing enough back story so readers could understand what made the characters tick.  He also did an impressive job including period related details such as desegregation of the US military and racism into the storyline, though there were a few anachronisms in the book.  For example, there were times the characters used slang that was out of period.  With stronger editing HAVE YOU EVER? could have easily been a five star book.  Victor McCullum is a promising young author with a great deal of potential.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Who Are You?	Vanessa Morman's novel, KONFLICT OF INTEREST, is an interesting read that intertwines romance, mystery, politics and the armed forces.  Yaniesha \\"Yani\\" Bowe is a United States Air Force Captain that is kidnapped while on vacation because it is believed that she witnessed  a murder.  Her kidnapper is the gorgeous and ever so dangerous Alec Poore.  Yani and Alec marry out of convenience and soon find themselves mutually attracted to one another.  Yet, there is a small problem.  Instead of being the notorious crime loard Yani thought he was, Alec is revealed to be Agent Quansi Harrington with the FBI. Drama ensues when Yani is not sure who she is married to and when multiple women stake claims to both Alec and Quansi.  Both parties are forced to look deep within themselves and within each other to establish trust, a meaningful relationship, and most importantly to stay alive.<br />KONFLICT OF INTEREST is a well-written novel that is at times slow and a bit far-fetched, but still keeps the reader engrossed through over 400 pages.  The story spans over several decades and allows the reader an opportunity to feel a real connection with all of the characters.  Morman does an excellent job portraying women and the military in an extremely positive light, while at the same time exposing potential problems within the government and its agencies. I recommend this novel to those looking for an intelligent, yet romantic, action-filled read.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Have a Merry Christmas?	Tomalis Wolfe, CEO of Wolfe Industries has everything his heart desires: a healthy best friend, beautiful wife, plenty of money, successful children, and honest, hardworking, loyal employees - or does he?<br />With the holiday season and annual company Christmas party fast approaching, Wolfe Industries is far from being full of Christmas cheer.  Zetta, the wife of the CEO, gets her kicks finding new acquisitions; or should I say men to occupy her time.  Anastasia and Shakia, secretaries in the assistants' pool, offer more than just office services to clients of Wolfe Industries.  Being guided by the right-hand man, Bradford, their pockets are definitely being laced with more than a meager salary.  Diana, Bradford's assistant, would like nothing more than for Bradford to crawl back under the rock from whence he came.  Constantly being sexually harassed by him is getting to be a little bit more than she can take.<br />With all of this hoopla, can things get any wilder?  Tomalis grieves over information he receives from his best friend, realizes that he wants out of his marriage, and finds out that his children are deeply disturbed.  What next?  It's true what they say about the tables being turned.  As all the back-stabbers plot to hurt Tomalis, the annual Christmas party dishes a healthy dose of laughter upon them all...<br />Christmas this year was done up right - Zane style.  With all the right doses of drama, erotica, love, and laughter, readers can only expect the best from this present.  The additional gifts don't hurt either; Zane adds spice to everyone's lives with her added bonus section.  What's in it?  You'll have to unwrap those specialties yourself to see...<br />Reviewed by T. Belinda Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Speculative fiction...	Sheree R. Thomas' first compilation, Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction From the African American Diaspora, received critical acclaim for its quality and historical value.  Her second collection is due similar accolades.<br />DARK MATTER: READING THE BONES is speculative fiction from multiple vantage points.  With contributors ranging from W.E.B. DuBois to Charles Johnson to Nalo Hopkinson, this collection brings forth an opportunity for many different stories to be told and many voices to be heard. DARK MATTER: READING THE BONES is a mystical journey that is somewhat sequential in its presentation; the stories of the Middle Passage are placed at the beginning, and the tales of future worlds are placed near the end.  The result is a time travel experience sort of like that depicted in the final story, \\"Trance\\" by Kalamu ya Salaam, where the reader only has to flip back a few pages to recount history or flip forward to get a glimpse of the future.<br />There honestly was not one story in the entire compilation that I could say I disliked, but there are some favorites that I feel I must mention by name.  Pam Noles' \\"The Whipping Boy\\" was heartwrenching. Walter Mosley's \\"Whispers in the Dark\\" was thoughtful and amazing. John Cooley's \\"The Binary\\" was adventurous and exciting.  Charles R. Saunders' \\"Yahimba's Choice\\" was heartbreaking and poignant. I could go on and on.  This is a book I would suggest every science fiction, fantasy, or horror lover read as soon as they can.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Testing your faith	BETWEEN FLOORS AND OPEN DOORS is about spirituality and what happens where your faith is tested. Jonas Brooks is having a lot of hard luck in his life and feels that God isn't on his side anymore.  The last straw comes after he catches his wife cheating; he vows never to go to church again.  He no longer wants to be a Christian.<br /><br />Ronez \\"Rony\\" Lee meets Brooklyn Davis after rear-ending him in a traffic accident.  They have an immediate attraction towards each other and eventually begin dating. She is a Christian and he has been struggling with his faith for the past twelve years. Rony starts witnessing to him hoping to help him realize the power in loving God.  Brooklyn isn't really interested in rekindling his relationship with God.  However, although he feels hesitant, he also feels that if he doesn't comply he may lose Rony as a mate.<br /><br />In the end, each of the characters experiences a life-changing event.  Brooklyn witnesses a robbery.  Jonas finally confronts his cheating wife.  Rony loses a good friend.  What will be the outcome for each?  Will each incident help them realize the power in loving God?<br /><br />BETWEEN FLOORS AND OPEN DOORS had a good message but it wasn't articulated - at all.  It reads like Mr. Williams merely cut and paste the pages of a journal into a book without having it professionally edited.  I got lost trying to figure out the dialogue. The scenes switched so often, I had to reread them to get a better understanding.  The fragmented sentence structure, grammatical and punctuation errors, different fonts, misspelled words, and overemphasis on words and phrases significantly depleted the quality of the book. An example, the final chapter is called \\"Revolation.\\" As if I weren't taunted enough, the ending is a book of poetry called Jonas Wail. I guess the typos are more acceptable in poetry.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ess Mays<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Sugar and spice and everything nice�not!	Move over James Patterson and Detective Alex Cross, mayhem, murder and<br />mystery has a new team-Keith Lee Johnson and FBI Special Agent Phoenix<br />Perry.  In SUGAR & SPICE: A NOVEL, author Keith Lee Johnson bursts onto<br />the literary scene with a spellbinding page-turner about a set of twins<br />with an evil set of minds.  The twins are being paroled from prison after<br />serving a ten-year stretch.  While in prison, they made the choice to stay<br />alive.  In order to survive, the two chose to become the \\"property\\" of<br />those with the power to protect them and suffered many indignities as a<br />result.  With hardened hearts, they used their free time planning to<br />extract revenge on everyone responsible for putting and keeping them in prison.<br />Now out of prison, with some major axes to grind, the twins set off on a<br />rampage of plunder, murder and rape that began on the east coast and moved<br />to the west coast. The brutal crime scenes left behind appeared similar,<br />yet unconnected because of the distance and the seemingly unrelated victims<br />involved.  With little evidence found at the scenes, the job of solving the<br />crimes fell into the hands of one of the city's finest and she just happened<br />to be a sister.  That's right, FBI Special Agent Phoenix Perry is a badge-<br />carrying African American female with the power and skill to make life a<br />little uneasy for the murderers.  As Agent Perry uncovered the truth, she<br />put herself in danger and unearthed some truly shocking evidence.<br />Keith Lee Johnson has crafted a masterful tale of murder and mystery with<br />lots of twists and turns; some of which will leave you with your mouth<br />hanging open while holding on the edge of your seat.

Dealing with Death	Often too grim or frightening for open discussion, death is not a popular topic for conversation, neither is it common for books.  However, undaunted by this dark theme's prevalence to intimidate, author Jeffrey L. Scudder accepts the task of openly dealing with death. In his novel WHEN DEATH WALKS AMONGST US, Scudder presents readers with a collection that includes five true stories and one fictional story of life, death, and how people grieve.  His accounts illustrate various ways in how people deal with losing loved ones, how children cope with death-threatening bullies, and how troublesome it can be for adopted children to uncover their true identity.  Including romance in one story and science fiction in another story, Scudder presents his message of dealing with death to readers of varying tastes.<br />WHEN DEATH WALKS AMONGST US is a very interesting read, and the author is a good storyteller. However, the grammatical errors in the book seriously distract from the stories.  Were it not for the editing, I would rate this collection of short stories a 4/4.5 as I truly enjoyed Mr. Scudder's work.  I loved the romance in \\"A Grievous Reckoning\\", and I totally enjoyed \\"The Forlorn One\\" and \\"The Last Delivery\\". He obviously enjoys writing and sharing with readers different medical facts along with the different ways in which death, or the threat of it, affects us all.  I could empathize with his characters and, in sharing their troubles, I learned more about myself.  Even still, grammar is a major part of good writing, and, unfortunately, it is the only part lacking in this book.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Careful what you pray for	TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING is the long awaited sequel to Casting the First Stone.  Curtis Black, the man with a gift for gab, returns and is once again called to ministry.  Members of his previous church - Faith Missionary Baptist Church - formed a new church called Truth Missionary Baptist Church and want the infamous Curtis Black to be their senior pastor.  A stipulation: he had to be married within two years because it didn't look right to have a pastor who is single.  He has been courting Mariah for six months and she prayed everyday hoping the fine Curtis Black would ask her to be his wife.  So, in an effort to appease his board and regain his notoriety, he asked Mariah to marry him.  Her prayers were answered, but shortly after marrying him, Mariah began to realize that she had to be careful of what she prayed for. She was now praying for a calm resolution to her personal dilemma.<br /><br />The humiliation that previously caused Curtis to lose his family, his church, and his unborn child five years ago only proved to be a temporary restraint.  His constant lust for women, greed for money, and need to have power remained ever present and were now leading him down the same detrimental path to corruption.  Only this time, his wrath filters into his family and could possibly cause him to permanently lose not only his church, but also his 14-year old daughter Alicia, his 5-year old son Matthew, and one of his mistresses.<br /><br />TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING is a novel that left lingering questions in regards to how much fiction the story is - really.  It also serves as a lesson to those who believe that asking for forgiveness is justification for an act.  In this eye-opening novel, you come to realize that forgiveness is truly granted when you finally realize that your indiscretions can (and will) have a lasting affect on the people around you. Mrs. Roby has a vivid imagination and pulled me into her story.

The Beat Goes On...	In SHIFTING, noted psychologist Kumea Shorter-Gooden and newspaper correspondent Charisse Jones take a sobering look at what they hypothesize is a uniquely African-American phenomenon.  \\"Shifting\\" is the terminology they use to label behaviors they classify as a coping strategy, developed by women of color, to deal with race and gender bias in a largely white, male dominated culture.<br />The authors use research, interviews and surveys to show how African American women are forced to lead double lives in their efforts to assimilate into a society that tends to marginalize and stereotype them and their abilities.  This book does a remarkable job of raising awareness on how the lives of these women are impacted in their communities, the workplace, and other areas such as child rearing, religion, personal grooming, and even amorous relationships.<br />SHIFTING is an outstanding collaboration between two noteworthy women that deals with a mostly unaddressed but nonetheless troubling issue from the perspective of the victims.  The book makes for a very interesting read and imparts a wealth of information regarding the ongoing plight of people of color in a society deeply scarred by racism and sexism.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Now she's been given a chance to tell her story from the highs to the lows and back again, and the result is a gripping biogrpahy of one of the most talented singers to ever pick up a microphone.<br />Despite what people may think, Chaka's life was not all glitter and stardust.  In fact, it wasn't until her teens that the idea of becoming a professional singer even entered her mind.  Raised in Chicago during the tumultuous era of the Black Panthers and civil unrest, Chaka had her share of reasons to grow up and leave the violence and heartache that the movement often brought. Thus began her journey.<br />THROUGH THE FIRE highlights Chaka's ups and down in the recording industry as well as her personal life. The book was an eye-opener to many of the things that are wrong with the music business, but it was also a memoir of Chaka's struggle to maintain control of her world in an industry that has been the fall of many.  Chaka's story reads like a letter to the reader in many ways. The language is casual and the stories are somewhat chronological, bringing to mind an old friend telling a story over a cup of coffee. I felt as though I had been a part of Chaka's journey.  I'd encourage all of Chaka's fans and naysayers, as well as those who have yet to experience her, to read this book.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

There is just one major drawback, he lives in another country so she now has to decide if he is worth her taking yet another chance at love and maybe relocating again.<br />With MY DIET STARTS TOMORROW, Ms. Handfield has crafted a hilarious yet emotional look at dating. This is a story that to which anyone who has experienced the tumultuous world of boy-meets-girl can relate. As I read this story I reflected on some of my dating experiences, and I have laughed so hard. I thank the author for letting others know that there is someone out there who understands how stressful, funny, and demanding dating can be. I enjoyed MY DIET STARTS TOMORROW and look forward to more of the author's work.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of THE RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Secrets can destroy	Children are a precious gift from God and they should be nurtured and protected. Imagine how you'd feel if you failed to protect your gift from heaven. In REHOBOTH ROAD, we meet the Turners, the Olivers and MaDear. These unforgettable characters tell a story of lost innocence, familial love, Christianity and that old time caring of a community. This story begins in the 1950's on Rehoboth Road in a rural community just outside Macon, Georgia. And for the next thirty-six years or so, we follow the growth of two families as they deal individually with a secret that works like a cancer as it touches each one of them.<br />Anita Ballard-Jones uses her excellent storytelling abilities to capture the disposition of the African American culture in rural communities during the 50's and 60's. She told a very inspirational and heartrending story. I could not put this one down, as I soaked up the essence of the characters and lived through the pain inflicted because of one man's sin. There were times I cried because of that pain and other times I rejoiced because of the healing that occurred. REHOBOTH ROAD is a stimulating read and I highly recommend it.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Matters of the Flesh	IF ONLY YOU KNEW by Marian E., details the history of two characters that is sinful and despicable at best.  A chance encounter between the two at their place of employment has dire consequences some years later for all involved. Tyson Taylor, a man whom you would assume has everything going for him, falls in lust with the beautiful Zyelle Brooks. Tyson does what is so unlike him, he falls for a stranger when he has a dependable and steady girl at home. Zyelle does what she does best and that is bedding unknown men.<br />The beginning of this story gives the impression that it is another tale about adults unable to control their raging hormones. The mannerisms and vocabulary of Zyelle is street and makes you wonder where the story is going.  Halfway through, substance comes into play, the writing is improved and the story becomes stronger, begging you to read on.  Additionally, the second half showcases the author's lyrical writing style that is not apparent in the first half.  The author adds secondary characters that are strong in personality and in deed.  They play a vital role in the overall story and assist in the readers' understanding of the main characters' irresponsible behaviors at the expense of themselves and others.  In the end, what unfolds is a sad story of the choices we make and the retribution.  The emotions displayed are realistic and the characters' actions wreak havoc like none we have seen before.<br />My disappointment with this book is that it is a labored read, caused by the lack of transitioning between the past and the present.  However, Marian E., has penned a story laced with information that is necessary for our survival.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
My Love Is A Challenge	THORN'S CHALLENGE by Brenda Jackson is the third delightful installment of the Westmoreland Family series.  Initiated by Delaney's Desert Sheikh and A Little Dare, respectively, THORN'S CHALLENGE showcases Thorn Westmoreland who is appropriately named because he is a thorn in everyone's side, especially his family.  Moody, cantankerous and temperamental, Thorn is a professional motorcycle designer and racer who withholds himself from others to prepare for the big money making races.<br />Thorn's challenge is none other than the feisty Tara Matthews, resident doctor and best friend of Thorn's sister Delaney.  Tara was introduced in Delaney's Desert Sheikh and because of a love gone wrong, Tara now has no time for romance or one night stands.  Thorn's motives are all wrong as he sets out to tame Tara with a deal that will either make or break both of them and the entire Westmoreland family.<br />I truly enjoy Brenda Jackson's connecting books because she sets the stage for the next book with subtle hints of hits and misses that will pique your senses.  The remaining brothers, Stone, Chase and Storm, are endearing and hilarious and it will be a treat to see their stories unfold.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

True Account of Ninteenth-century Racism	During the early 1800's Sarah, a South African Khoekhoe tribal woman(degradingly refered to as Hottentots), witnesses the salughter and displacement of her people by European settlers. In desperation, she leaves her home to seek a new life in the city of Cape Town. However, the only thing that awaits her there are menial jobs with slave-like conditions, physical and emotional abuse. Alone and easily seduced, Sarah willingly leaves South Africa for the promise of love, fame and fortune in Europe. Sarah was told she would become rich as an African dancing queen. However, her white companions had another agenda in mind for her. For it was her unique bodyshape(manipulated by tribal rituals), of extremly protrudding buttocks and genitals described as an \\"apron\\", is what her white caregivers wanted to exploit. Finding herself in Europe touted as a \\"freak\\", caged and naked, for all who pays to see, she is billed as the \\"HOTTENTOT VENUS\\". What ensues is a tale that spans seven years in a life that is filled with broken promises, rascism, suffering, and hearbreak.<br />Barbara Chase-Riboud brings to life the heartwrenching tale of Sarah Baartman by combining factual, historical data with gripping story telling. In HOTTENTOT VENUS, Chase-Riboud steps back in time to the ninteenth-century and recreates a world steeped in sexism, and the ideal of European superiority. Told in the voice of several of the main characters against the backdrop of slums, courtrooms and medical facilities the reader is emmersed in the thoughts and attitudes of the day. There are shockingly vivid scences describing what Sarah endures that will leave readers angry and sadden. However, the ending will give a since of long overdue justice for Sarah. A truly haunting read, one that will stay with you long after the book is read. I recommend the novel  to all.<br />Reviewed by L. Raven James<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

The sins of the father	LUST OF THE FLESH is a compelling account of people living on the<br />edge of lustful madness, swept away by the waters of carnality,<br />leaving a trail of death, deceit and destruction. This story<br />begins in 1963 in Cottonplant, Georgia. Big-Blue Fleming visits<br />a gypsy witch doctor seeking a cure from one of his sexual<br />encounters and is informed that he is filled with perverted<br />spirits.

When love comes calling.	Rap sensation and player extraordinaire, Anthony \\"Animalistic\\" Talbert thoroughly enjoys all the trappings of his success - fame, fortune, and a different woman in his bed every night.<br /><br />One night after a sold-out concert, Anthony meets Randi Jacobs, to whom he is immediately attracted.  Believing that Randi is like all of his other groupies, Anthony mistakenly assumes that Randi wants her chance to sleep with a superstar.  Randi is attracted to Anthony, but not enough to compromise her morals and sleep with him after meeting him only one time.  Not accustomed to being rejected, Anthony is so intrigued by Randi that he doggedly pursues her in hopes that he can get her to change her mind.<br /><br />With a unique spin on the classic tale of love and romance, author Debra Clayton pens a good story, complete with characters different from the norm.  Although there were some punctuation and grammatical errors, and some parts of the story that were stereotypical and somewhat demeaning to women, I enjoyed this book and look forward to other works by this promising new author.<br /><br />Reviewed by Renee Williams<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
All That Glitters...	In USING WHAT YOU GOT, Karen Quinones Miller uses a deceptively simple palette to paint an intricate portrait which delves into the dysfunctional dynamics of a single parent household headed by a father with a questionable value system.  Harlem is the backdrop for this gritty story, with its vibrant colloquial style, but at its core is a theme of family love and loyalty.<br /><br />The centerpiece of this provocative work of fiction is glamour girl extraordinaire Tiara Bynum.  Tiara is a college student whose vain preoccupation with her physical appearance is only matched by her determination to find a wealthy man. Tiara and her tomboyish younger sister JoJo's only parental role models are their father Reggie, an ex-gambler/ex-prize fighter turned sanitation worker, and their whiskey imbibing Aunt Charlie, whose once beautiful face was disfigured in an auto accident.  Reggie is fiercely devoted to his daughters and is indulgent with them to a fault. He has, however, instilled less than stellar values in Tiara regarding the importance of finding a man who can spoil and provide for her materially.<br /><br />When Tiara meets Lionel with his sleek Porche and designer clothes, she is immediately mesmerized by his flashy lifestyle and sees him as her dream man.  Matters become complicated when she finds herself attracted to Rashad, a down to earth, community oriented cab driver whose seeming indifference to her good looks only serves to peak Tiara's interest in him.  Soon Tiara has to make a choice which will change her life forever.<br /><br />In USING WHAT YOU GOT Karen creates characters that are at once endearing and exasperating.  At the end of the story the reader is left with the impression  that Tiara has somehow been reformed by her experiences, which makes the story a bit incredible.  Overall this book is a very thought-provoking read.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17
Why hate?	In her first published work, JUST BEFORE DAWN, Stacy Anderson has provided a treat for readers.  She has included a short story and several poems from her repertoire.  In the short story, we are transported back to the late 1940's through the eyes of Rena, a young black girl growing up in Centerville, Georgia.  We learn the hardships African American suffered at the hands of hatred and bigotry.  Rena witnesses many of the atrocities Blacks suffered as a result of the old Jim Crow Laws.  She lived during a time when a black man had to walk with his head down for fear of being accused of inappropriately looking at a white woman.  The very same hate killed her father and husband caused her to suffer indignities as a young black woman growing up.<br />The poetry collection catalogues an eight-year period of Ms. Anderson's life entitled \\"My Awakening.\\"  She divided the collection into sections that identify three distinct phases of her life.  The first phase is Black identity, the second phase is the Love and the third phase is titled My Spiritual Walk.  Surprisingly, each phase also seems to symbolize Rena's growth in the short story.  There is the awakening to what it means to be Black, the realization that not having a man doesn't mean you're less than a woman and finally through it all, a personal relationship with God brings us through all things good and bad.<br />Stacy Anderson has penned a rather moving short story about a young woman's coming of age as she witnesses the pain and suffering of African Americans through a very tough era in our history and how she overcame it all to live a loving, productive life.  Anderson has eloquently written poetry that depicts her struggles as a woman. My favorite poem from the collection is \\"Spirituality.\\"<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Leaving home	America: the biggest, greatest, wealthiest country in the world. So why would an educated, well-known activist find it hard to live here? Why indeed would he turn his back on the country of his birth? In QUITTING AMERICA Randall Robinson gives us an unvarnished view of what life is really like for a Black man in America. With a no-holds-barred style, he lets us in on not only the unpublished, uncensored history of the United States but also how that history has affected all of us through the years. For instance, he uses a Black boy on the streets of Rochester, New York as an example of a person who doesn't know where he came from and therefore has no idea and even less control over where he is going. He calls him Man-boy. Man-boy sees himself only as the United States sees him: a Black male to be feared. The United States left out Man-boy's history when they stole his ancestors from somewhere in Africa. His memory banks have been erased about the powerful and wonderful people from whom he sprang. Man-boy is doomed before he even gets started.<br />Robinson also delves deeply into the politics of the United States. He explains the hatred shown by Columbus when he \\"discovered\\" the New World toward the indigenous populations that offered him a warm welcome. Seeing only profit and land to steal, Columbus disrupted the peaceful life-styles and attempted to turn the natives into slaves for the Europeans back home. Failing that, countries in Africa were raided and the inhabitants were brought to the New World to accomplish his sick goals. This need to conquer and control, the desire for all things material still determines the direction the United States takes in its fatal attempts to rule the world.<br />In addition, Robinson gives us the historical background of the democracy next door to us and the reasons for the hatred shown toward Haiti. The Haitian Slave Revolt literally revolted American sensibilities and their perceived reasons for the existence of Blacks. Because of that anger, the United States is still mistreating Haitians, whether it's the unequal treatment of Haitian refugees or the unfair embargoes placed upon the island nation itself.<br />QUITTING AMERICA is a dynamite book that should be mandatory reading for all Americans, especially those who have and are causing problems for U.S. citizens as well as the rest of the countries of the world. Unfortunately, as Robinson points out, very few white people will read it because he is not saying what they want to hear. He is too truthful and too hard-hitting. He is not squeamish, even when it comes to national Black \\"heroes\\" such as Condaleeza Rice and Colin Powell. He tells the truth even when it would be prudent to go along with the status quo. I can't recommend this book highly enough.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersof that anger, the United States is still mistreating Haitians, whether it's the unequal treatment of Haitian refugees or the unfair embargoes placed upon the island nation itself.<br />QUITTING AMERICA is a dynamite book that should be mandatory reading for all Americans, especially those who have and are causing problems for U.S. citizens as well as the rest of the countries of the world.

Diamonds Are Forever	Flying, whirling, spiraling through the night sky, the beautiful and powerful North Wind takes little Diamond and the reader on countless journeys throughout England in the late 1800's.  As Diamond travels with North Wind he experiences what it means to truly live, and he matures in wisdom far beyond his young years.<br />Throughout the novel, numerous hardships befall Diamond's family, and he is forced to drive a horse-drawn cab in order to help his family survive. Although just a young boy at the time, he shows remarkable strength, and fortune seems to follow him in whatever he does. But is it fortune or North Wind?  Even though mostly indirectly, North Wind plays an extremely manipulating part in Diamond's life, for the good and the temporary bad. One night, she takes him on a magical flight to a beautiful country behind her, and throughout all his trials and achievements, Diamond longs to revisit that peaceful country. Diamond's life is grievous, but his innocence forever pulls him closer to his heart's desire.<br />With wonderfully created characters, excellent scenery, and master storytelling skills, British author George MacDonald has written a marvelous piece of classical children's literature that has thrived through over one hundred years of written storytelling.  Although fantastical in nature, he imparts on his readers, through the personalities and behaviors of Diamond and his family, a certain level of morality that is almost nonexistent today.  This children's novel is written in classical British English, yet it is easy and fun to read with many songs, poems and stories within the larger story.  MacDonald does an excellent job of depicting life and death in a positive manner, and the parallels to Christianity and God's relationship to his children are evident for all readers to see.  Even though some of the formal British mannerisms outlined within these pages are antiquated, I highly recommend this story to any parent looking to provide their child with a good, wholesome work of literature. AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND also serves as a great comparison to modern prose and society.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswith a good, wholesome work of literature.

Dana Dances Through Life	Dana Strong, a progeny of the hip hop era and the harsh New York streets, has dreams of becoming a writer and a professional dancer.  However, numerous misfortunes arise throughout her life deferring her dreams indefinitely.<br />Dana's family never had much, therefore they relied heavily on each other for mental, emotional, and financial support.  Throughout her life, her mother had always been her best friend and her grandmother was always her best motivator.  Dana observed while abuse, drugs, and disease caused distruction in her family and in her community. She continued to struggle searching for her place in a world that showed no mercy. Often falling into the same sins that destroyed people around her, Dana found herself morally drowning in addictions that she never would have imagined succumbing to.  One day, she is rescued from her dance of death and degradation and given an opportunity to finally dance the way she had always dreamed.<br />Darcel Turner paints a vivid and sometimes preachy portrait of the countless hardships urban New York minorities often face.  Her main character Dana, who takes on the name Darcel a few times in the novel, portrays high moralistic standards but does not conduct her own personal life according to those standards.  The novel begins with Dana dreaming of dancing and somehow that dream metamorphosed into a dream of writing without the main character ever truly pursuing, nor really fulfilling, her original dream.  With only an extremely small, inconsequential section devoted to Dana's dancing to music, I did not feel her passion for dancing.  I would like to have seen more of her dancing abilities through other characters' viewpoints.<br />Ms. Turner did a great job of taking time to provide us with an explicitly realistic novel; however I was a little disappointed with Dana's sudden, magical claim to freedom at the end.

Conspiracy theory	BOUND BY DECEPTION tells the story of a corrupt organization called the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) that has an unethical mission. The leader of the organization is a man named Bob Anderson and a US Senator allegedly funds their illegal activities. It's comprised of government officials, investment bankers, attorneys, business consultants and corporate CEOs and presidents.<br />Kavon Bell, once a consultant to both the CIA and FBI, now operates K-Group Intelligence Consultant Services.  He has mistakenly come across top-secret documents of an NIA operation to eliminate all African American CEOs and presidents of major corporations. His girlfriend, Sylvia Moreland, is the CEO and president of Shield Security Inc., which provides legal, corporate and data security for retired government officials and corporate CEOs and presidents.<br />Kavon becomes puzzled by his discovery. The assassination of a top African American CEO, who happened to be one of Sylvia's clients, leads Kavon to believe the NIA is responsible. It becomes a race against time to dissolve a conspiracy theory.  Will the NIA find out Kavon's intentions?  Or will they be discovered and brought to justice?<br />BOUND BY DECEPTION is a slow paced read that eventually picks up near the end.

Everyone Has Issues	Shawne Johnson has written a complex and compelling story of three sisters.  As the stories of the lives of Violet, Lilly, and Rose emerge I found myself deeply engrossed in this engaging tale.  Violet has what appears to be a perfect family life, but no matter how much energy she puts in to appearances she cannot mask the deep unhappiness that resides in her heart as a result of her less than perfect marriage.  Lilly is still a little stuck in the Black Power Movement but lost in a cesspool of drug abuse.  She uses drugs to help numb realities that are too difficult for her to face, but loses herself in the process.  Rose is a politically conscious woman who is a successful artist and single mother.  She carries the deep wounds of her past in the form of a secret that seemingly make her current political views and the manner in which she is raising her daughter hypocritical.  As Johnson weaves this intricate tale, each of these women discover that they cannot hide from what is real and are forced to deal with their pasts and shed their masks.<br />Johnsons writing is reminiscent of authors who write with a more literary flair.  In between revealing chapters about the lives of the respective characters she intersperses chapters which are referred to as Studio Time.  In these passages the author juxtaposes Roses artwork with the events that have just taken place and the result at times will leave you breathless.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be a refreshing change.  The strong themes of sisterhood and redemption were well executed.  My only disappointment was in the ending, which I felt was a little rushed and lacked in closure.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-17

Dark Corner	Date Reviewed: December 5, 2003<br />David Hunter, son of a famous writer and absentee father, found it strange when his father willed his entire fortune to him upon his death.  This act sent David's mind spinning with questions about who his father really was and what secrets he may have kept of himself.<br />The town of Mason's Corner, Mississippi, also dubbed &quot;Dark Corner&quot;, was the kind of town where few things went wrong and few crimes were committed. As such, the town was policed by a small force headed by Chief Van Jackson.  However, after the arrival of a mysterious man renting the town's haunted house, the mansion where the town's namesake was killed by his slaves, strange things started happening in Dark Corner.<br />When David Hunter moved to the seemingly quaint town to find out the truth about his family by living in the home where his father lived before his disappearance, the last thing on his mind was waging a battle against superhuman beings.  Nevertheless, that was what he found himself entrenched in when a force so unbelievably strong and ruthless awoke from a long and deep slumber.  Consequently, David was deemed the &quot;chosen one&quot; and was forced to take on the most difficult challenge of his life: fulfilling his family's legacy.<br />Massey masterfully creates his characters and binds them to your heartstrings.  While David's character is strongly crafted, it was the secondary characters that truly brought DARK CORNER to life.  This solid character lineup coupled with a riveting plot is, to me, what a book should be.<br />DARK CORNER is a fine way to follow-up Massey's debut Thunderland. Many times, authors are nervous about their sophomore efforts, but Massey has no reason to be.  This is his most innovative and chilling work yet, and I imagine it can only get better from here.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2004-01-01
No Yellow Brick Road.	The HONEY WELL is a shocking tale with unbelievable revelations. Esther<br />Rayford has achieved her dream; she is quite prominent and now owns the<br />Victorian Mansion where her mother once worked as a housekeeper. The<br />mansion is reverently called The Honey Well by the frequent patrons who<br />visit Esther's 'ladies-of-charm'. But the road to her affluence was<br />paved on the back of her daughter, Arnell. Arnell hates the mansion with<br />a passion.<br />When Arnell was sixteen, naively thinking that her mother would protect<br />her, Esther rents her daughter out. Seventeen years later Arnell cannot<br />cut the umbilical cord to free herself from Queen Esther. She does<br />however physically move from the mansion, acquire a degree, and become<br />engaged to an up and coming politician. Although she is 33 years old, she<br />is still emotionally dependent on her mother, Esther blackmails her into<br />handling just one more client each time she tries to back away. Arnell<br />has very little self esteem, but she knows she cannot continue living<br />this life of shameful secrets. The love, hate relationship between mother<br />and daughter sometimes makes Arnell long to be motherless. Because Ester<br />is jealous of Arnell, this is not a situation where `mother knows best.'<br />When Esther introduces yet another sixteen year old to the business of<br />the mansion; when snippets of Esther's past start to unfold; and when an<br />unforgivable night of lust at the Honey Well, involving Arnell's fianc&eacute;<br />surfaces, Arnell has had enough. She accepts that Esther will never be<br />the mother she has always needed and she prepares for the battle of her<br />life.<br />This one charters new territory for Ms. Mallette. It is gritty,<br />melodramatic, and profane. Innuendo is out of place here; the action<br />is in your face. And as with all of Ms. Mallette's books, there is a<br />moral to this profound story, but your emotions will run the gamut before<br />you will be able to accept it. This is indeed a page turner, and each<br />turn ignites a fiery reaction.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersto accept it.

SEEKING GOD AND STANDING BESIDE YOUR MAN	For the most part, I enjoyed the book and the lessons being taught along with the references to the Bile, but I felt the book was very repetitive in parts and it seemed more like a Bible-Study reference vs. an inspirational read. I think it will work well for those who are already secure in their positions in life (with God), but may seem a bit preachy to those who are hoping to become more spiritually grounded.  Additionally, those looking for the \\"key\\" to making their relationships successful with the men in their lives may be a bit disappointed as the book focuses more on our relationship with God and the correlations between the Bible and to our mates.<br />In spite of this, there are numerous valuable lessons in the book, such as women looking for men to fulfill their deepest needs and complete them instead of going to God for the spiritual thirst that only He can quench, suggestions on being content with not having a man in our lives, and thinking that our worth is conditional upon another person.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Murder and mystery...	FALLEN SNOW, a gritty street tale, takes you deep into the world of drugs, murder, incest, homosexuality, adultery, fornication, crooked cops and dirty politicians.

A great reference!	FAMOUS BLACK QUOTATIONS is a great resource to just about anyone, whether they are a student doing research, a presenter seeking to add some historical content or anyone looking for additional knowledge!  It includes quotations from well-known persons such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Sojourner Truth, but it also provides quotes from lesser-known persons as well.  These topics include love, struggle, self-reliance and making discoveries, just to name a few!  One of my personal quotations hails from August Wilson.  It reads, \\"All you need in the world is love and laughter.  That's all anybody needs.  To have love in one hand and laughter in the other.\\"  When one reflects on this quote, its truth seems to jump off the pages!<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers<br />Complete review can be found on our website...	2003-12-06

A Look Inside the Fall	Engrossing and energetic, Author Terry E. Hill delivers an excellent premier novel as he skillfully carries the reader into the life of Elijah Farrow. Hill tastefully portrays a scandalous affair while showcasing its effects on the political careers of those closest to the Mayor and his lover. The language and the characters are real, and there are sufficient twists to keep any reader engaged from start to finish.  INSIDE THE FALL is complete without tying up all loose ends, and the characters are well-developed for such a short novel.  A few grammatical errors only briefly distract from an otherwise compelling story.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed INSIDE THE FALL and the characters - whose lives I had the brief privilege of observing.

Beautiful &amp; touching....	Though under seventy pages, SKIPPING THROUGH LIFE: THE REASON I AM by Sylvia McClain is an emotional ride that passes through the streets of happiness, despair, and understanding.  In this memoir, Ms. McClain opens the gates to her past, reflective of the roads she's crossed while traveling through the journey of life.  Though some parts of the book were painful, I was left with a feeling of closure and acceptance as I reflected back on my own life.<br />McClain expertly teaches that joy comes from within and that when we follow our dreams, accept our failures, and move on with life, we can truly begin to live.<br />Though short and with minor typos, this is a beautiful story that should be read by not only those on their last leg of hope, but also those who may be the crutch to them.

Ups and Downs of Love	DISSAPEARING ACTS is a bold reflection of the day-to-day obstacles we encounter in relationships, and how we go about understanding, avoiding, and learning from them. It is also an affirmation that love transcends all barriers, and demonstrates some of the many challenges those in a relationship face, especially between seemingly incompatible individuals.<br />Terry McMillan sticks to her style of constructing multi-faceted characters with their layers peeled back for the reader to see.  Even though you may be disappointed to read of Franklin's treatment of Zora, you're still able to see why he's the way he is and even be sympathetic towards him.  You can easily relate to how one might act if stripped of their job, dignity, pride, and self-respect.  Additionally, it is easy to relate to Zora and understand her position and how it is indeed possible to move on with your life, even when it doesn't seem fair or right.  Indicative of relationships across racial and social lines, DISAPPEARING ACTS is worthy of its title and the honor of being the very first book to be awarded the exclusive title of Blackboard Bestseller.  It is a book that is just as &quot;real&quot; today as it was when it was first penned over a decade ago.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Through the storm of abuse...	Amidst a back-drop of the rural South during the 1960s, THROUGH THE STORM focuses on domestic abuse, combined with the economic and social issues of the time period we often hear about in terms of trials and tribulations for people of color.  In her novel, Fatima Alexander mixes domestic violence, the struggle to survive the times, and the need to do whatever it takes to care for your children.  She takes the reader on a journey through these issues to show the individual heartaches a family can experience and then blends in the value of friendship in what seems to be a hopeless cause.<br />Ms. Alexander shares overwhelming truth and passion in the pages of this novel and is to be applauded for offering this story to others in hopes of helping someone in a similar situation.  In spite of this, I was turned off by the numerous grammatical errors, typos, tense changes, and inconsistencies in the book.  Additionally, a lot of the setting didn't fit the time frame presented and seemed a bit out of place.

Lover, virgin, mother	THE SALT ROADS is an engrossing tale of three women who step off of the pages and sit with you as you revel in their triumphs and tremble at their tribulations.  In reading this novel, I found that Hopkinson is a writer that uses stiff doses of human emotion and reality to balance out her themes of mythology, fantasy, and religion.

Be Careful what you wish for	AS WE LAY takes a hard look at the price of having an affair with a married man; a price ultimately paid by everyone close to the relationship...<br />Ms. Johnson tells this story with a uniquely mature look at infidelity, void of the intense drama so prevalent in some<br />relationship novels. And while this story in no way condones their volatile affair, it certainly gives an unrestricted view of the other side.

Two sides to every story	LOVE is (at first) confusing with the constant switching of views; however, the more you read, the more clarity invoked. It's a story that requires your undivided attention or else you risk having to reread the story just to get the point lost. It's a lesson of what happens when people dwell more on what was wrong rather than what was right with another human being.

McGlothin weaves an emotional story that will take the reader through a myriad of emotions.  Endearing characters abound in the pages of this story and help make it a compelling read.  My only problem with the story was that the ending was too tidy.  There were many subplots in the novel that were easy to follow and each had its own cliffhanger of sorts.

Dance with his soul	HOW TO FIND A GOOD BLACK MAN uses prose to give its readers first-hand knowledge from a man's point of view.  It tells the what, why, how, and where to finding a good Black man and gives a brief example of each.  Furthermore, Mr. McClendon suggests in order for a woman to find a \\"good Black man,\\" she first has to dance with his soul.  Expensive clothes, fancy cars, nice houses and other materialistic things do not make a man; they just get your attention faster.  Knowing a person's inner being gives you more access to his soul and by taking this route it let's you know what makes him tick (so to speak).<br />HOW TO FIND A GOOD BLACK MAN starts with hilarious banter and ends with out-dated statistics, questionable sources and contradictions.  The book lacked substance for a \\"self-help\\" guide; it seemed things were thrown in for the sake of volume.

Struggling for equality...	In Zora Neale Hurston's classic, THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD, we see the issues of race and gender prevalent in the early 1900s, the strength and capacity to love that most women exhibit, and the celebration of African-American culture. We're introduced to Janie Crawford as she returns to Eatonville, FL.  Shunned by the people of this small town, she relies on her best friend to relate her experiences back to them in an attempt to satisfy their curiosity.  Weaving in flashbacks of her life as a child and on through her adulthood to the present moment, we're able to see Janie's growth.<br /><br />Raised by her grandmother, Janie was led to believe that a marriage to a wealthy man would bring her happiness; even if that wasn't the case initially. Unfortunately,  wealth alone is not enough for Janie; yet she learns to set boundaries on what she will and will not accept from a man.  Soon after, she leaves town with a smooth-talking man who promises her the world.  While he becomes quite successful and is able to provide for her, it's not the materialistic things she has her heart set on.  When he dies, she is given one more opportunity to find true love with a younger man who ends up being her soul mate.<br /><br />Through Janie's relationships, the dialogue, and settings, readers are able to see her internal conflict with what society forces upon her, what she's been taught to believe, and her feelings.  The story captures her struggle for equality, not only because she was black, but also because she was a woman.<br /><br />Sometimes a person needs the hardships of life, as well as a deep look inside themselves to truly be happy with their lives. While the romantic relationship between Janie and her husbands are at the forefront of this book, it contains so much more.  It is about Janie finding peace, acceptance, and embracing who she really was. Through Hurston's lyrical tone and the use of the time period's dialect, this story is brought to life beautifully. We're not only able to hear Janie's thoughts; we're able to feel them too.  Through Hurston's use of analogies, metaphors, and even humor, Janie's story ends up being a beautiful tribute to love, and also to African-American culture.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

It's not a leisurely read; rather it's a call to action for black journalists to step out of their comfort zones and press on to build a stronger organization than what was left in the aftermath of the 1990's. The NABJ was and is a key foundation for African-American journalists, and this book is a key read for both its proponents and skeptics.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers<br />Complete review can be found on our website...	2003-12-05
Who needs love and happiness?	Once again, Brenda Jackson does a good job of bringing real life situations to the forefront.  With a delicate balance of friendship, love, misinterpretation, lies and lust, THE SAVVY SISTAHS is a must read.  In addition to the excellent portrayal of characters, the underlying principles are the highlight of the book: When relying on faith and trust in God, dreams really do come true.<br />Reviewed by Belinda<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers<br />Complete review can be found on our website...	2003-12-05

When the lights go out	In this gripping mystery, Pamela Thomas Graham introduced the world to a new sister sleuth.  Graham's characterizations are phenomenal, the writing is flawless, and the storyline is enthralling.

Back in love again	WHEN PERFECT AIN'T POSSIBLE is a love story about a single mother of a teenage daughter who finds herself reluctantly falling in love with her daughter's guidance counselor.<br /><br />After a disastrous first marriage her daughter Nia's father, Imani, the protagonist, has given up on men.  When she is summoned to her daughter's guidance counselor's office, the last thing Imani expects to find is Braxton, an extremely attractive 6'1\\" head turner, who tickles her fancy but raises her ire.  Before long they develop an off again on again romance punctuated with satisfying sexual encounters.<br /><br />After a spiritual awakening, Imani starts having moral misgivings about the direction their relationship is taking and opts to end the affair.  Braxton on the other hand, is not ready for a serious relationship, but finds himself extraordinarily attracted to Imani.  After Nia and Braxton are involved in a near fatal auto accident, the two lovers are forced to make some life altering decisions.<br /><br />This book is a tedious read though it has it's bright moments.  The plot is meandering and the characters lack the depth necessary to keep the reader interested in a novel of this length.  The author does an admirable job in dealing with the issue of morality in a contemporary relationship. Perhaps a more condensed version of the story would make for a more engaging read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
To forgive is divine	Date Reviewed: September 6, 2003<br />This is a story of a sacrifice made for love, and the realization that<br />one person's sacrifice most often removes another person's choice.<br />Quiet, shy Asia Morrell was in awe when she met Nicholas Reynolds at<br />Howard University. Both were law students with hopes of sharing a law<br />practice and the rest of their lives. But Asia becomes pregnant, and<br />in order to preserve Nicholas' dream, she forfeited hers and disappeared.<br />Nicholas, now a renowned lawyer and a deeply religious man is in the<br />final stages of a divorce, or so he thinks. He is contemplating where<br />his life goes from here. His practice is thriving, still he is not<br />content, he muses over the lost of the only woman he has ever loved,<br />and he wonders where Asia is. But someone is wondering about Nicholas;<br />NBA basketball star Isaiah Reynolds Morrell, has finally tracked down<br />the one man who haunts his dreams.<br />The meeting between Nicholas and his son is shocking, heated and tender.<br />Nicholas never knew he had a son, and Isaiah has always wanted to know<br />his father. But hours after their climatic meeting, Isaiah is in a<br />tragic automobile accident, which could end his career and maybe his<br />life. Nicholas is devastated that he could lose the son he just found.<br />As he rushes into the hospital he comes face to face with his lost love<br />of 20 years. But before Asia and Nicholas can address their issues, they<br />must summon their faith and stay focused for their son.<br />TOMMORROW MAY NEVER COME is a richly spiritual story, and Ms. Hudson-<br />Smith delivers an inspiring message with people who are learning how<br />to forgive, and live by faith. At times I felt the story was a little<br />preachy, and some scenes seemed to drag, but depending on a readers<br />particular taste this may not be an issue for some. Nonetheless this is<br />a well written Christian Fiction with real human drama.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
Tradition	SWORD OF VALOR by Tom Willard is the fifth installment of the Black Sabre Chronicles.  In this highly educational and entertaining installment, Willard showcases women in the military during the Operation Desert Shield entanglement in the Middle East.  He focuses on the role that women played in times of wars that is often left to speculation.  Furthermore, Willard continues the saga of the Sharps family.  The Sharps are an African-American, five-generational military family and with SWORD OF VALOR, Argonne Sharps is the focal point.<br />As Argonne heads off to war in the Middle East, SWORD OF VALOR takes you into the life and history of her family and the contribution the family has made to the military for the past 130 years.  Reflecting methodically on their upbringing as members of the military and as members of a military family, a historical account is laid before our eyes.  Added to this account are the genuine feelings and reflections of the non-military members of the Sharps family.  Through them we come to the realization that some only imagine as they wait and learn the fate of their loved ones during times of battle.  Written in a descriptive and definitive language, readers receive a lesson in patriotism, loyalty and familial ties that bind.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

A Dark Relationship	HOBBLE tells of the shocking relationship that develops when Bennet Gillespie, a famed surgeon, has a chance encounter with Day on the beach.  What follows is an erotic tale that chronicles the relationship that develops between Bennet, Day, and Day's \\"guardian\\" Mr. Hopkins.  As the story progresses Bennet quickly discovers that Day's mysterious injuries are just the tip of the iceberg and as he discovers more about Day's sordid past he is both drawn to her and repulsed.  Over time Bennet finds himself involved in a relationship with Day, yet he must continue to share her with Mr. Hopkins.  Because of Day's sexual prowess and their strong physical relationship, Bennet accepts the fact that he cannot be her one and only.  As the story comes to a shocking climax and the true relationship between Day and Mr. Hopkins is revealed readers will find themselves aghast.<br />Sourna has definitely written a truly unique tale of lust.  However, this story is very dark and deals with issues that many readers will find difficult to stomach.  As the author attempts to build suspense in the plot the story tends to drag and much of the storyline lacks believability.  While Sourna spent a fair amount of time helping readers understand Day's past and her motivations for behaving as she did, there was a lack of such development in Bennet's character.  As a result, I found myself frequently wondering why he was drawn to such a twisted and unhealthy relationship.  I was disappointed by the conclusion of the story because it seemed a bit too tidy and convenient given the tumultuous nature of the rest of the book.  The author also includes excerpts from several upcoming releases.  Sourna classifies HOBBLE as a work of adult fiction and that is an accurate categorization, however, I would add that because of the sensitive nature of the plot even fans of erotica may find this book over the top.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay ...	2003-11-01
Right on Time!	Talk about a right on time blessing!  I received PRAYERS THAT PREVAIL as a gift from a friend.  This is a book that is loaded with prayers for seemingly any and every life situation that is reinforced by Bible verses.  In addition to the astounding, soul stirring prayers, it has an educational session at the beginning of the book that instructs, informs and guides the reader into their own personal prayer journey.  This book is nothing short of amazing!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to grow closer in their personal relationship with God and with himself. No matter where a person is in their Christian journey, PRAYERS THAT PREVAIL speaks to each life situation but while offering up a corresponding prayer.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
Relationship therapy.	Thomas Long has taken on the arduous task of talking women through<br />the highs and lows of relationship drama. Here are some excerpts<br />from the seven categories he chooses.<br />The Bag Lady Syndrome: Long strongly suggests that women take time<br />to be alone after ending a bad relationship so they can adequately<br />heal. Once they've taken the time to throw off the emotional baggage<br />of the past and are healthy again they are ready to re-enter the<br />dating scene.<br />A Vision Shared: His message is to avoid getting stuck in<br />relationships with individuals who are not on the same career path<br />or who are still trying to find their way. Don't be a career oriented<br />woman with a mate who is either \\"in-between\\" jobs or merely content<br />to live off his woman's generosity.<br />Social Compatibility: Avoid the jigsaw puzzle syndrome; trying to<br />arrange fragmented pieces into a perfect fit. If you have a man in<br />your life who does not share some similar interests with you, the<br />chemistry will probably not last.<br />Role Definition/Shared Responsibilities: Set some boundaries; With<br />no boundaries being set at the beginning of the relationship, neither<br />party is clear as to what constitutes non-acceptable behavior.<br />Spending Quality Time Together: First, it's important that each party<br />retain their individuality. So both the man and the woman should have<br />a set amount of personal time away from their partner to keep harmony<br />between them.  But they should amorously use the time when they are<br />together as an opportunity to exploit the time they were apart.<br />Keep The Flames Burning: It is important to have a good sex life<br />with your partner, good sex eases tension. Sexual chemistry between<br />partners is one of those mediums of communication that needs to be<br />maintained and constantly improved upon if the relationship is to<br />last.<br />Game Recognize Game: An unscrupulous man usually sends a lot of<br />warning signs, often unconsciously, which tell you if his agenda is<br />not sincere. The problem is many women choose not to see the truth<br />even when it stares them in the face.<br />With these seven relationship tips Mr. Long shares some practical<br />and insightful advice. He does not propose to voice what women<br />feel; however, he does base his views on a man's interpretation of<br />how he sees women. Arguably, a couple of his tips do reek of maleness,<br />but that's not a bad thing.

Conquering the Emperor	Enthralling, commanding, and enticing: these are just a few adjectives describing Stephen L. Carter's debut fiction novel THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK. Beginning the escapade with the suspicious death of Professor Talcott Garland's father, Judge Oliver Garland, Carter takes his readers on a whirlwind journey into the life of one of the only African-American professors tenured at an Ivy League law school.<br /><br />Having lived a highly controversial and politically debatable life, Judge Garland made many enemies, and most of them surfaced after his death, all battling each other to ascertain the infamous \\"Arrangements\\" the judge left behind. However, the whereabouts of the \\"Arrangements\\" were entrusted to Talcott posthumously by his father in forms of riddles and clues, and uncovering his father's secret threatens to take a devastating toll on Talcott's marriage, his career and his very life. Readers search with Talcott as he struggles to maintain his family, his status at the law school, and his very sanity while traveling the eastern seaboard searching for the cure to the mental strain his father imposed on him. Digging through his family's past and unearthing deadly secrets that should never see daylight, Talcott wanders in over his head and soon realizes, among other things, just the man his father was...and, consequently, just how much in danger he and his family really are.<br /><br />Stephen L. Carter has written a novel that deals just as brazenly with American politics as it does with the work involved in preserving family. The characters he creates are bold, alive, and literally jump off the page and into your mind. He does an excellent job of depicting race relations in America, in the judicial<br />system, and in high society, while keeping the reader entertained with the mishaps and downfalls of Professor Garland. Aside from being extremely verbose<br />and dry in spots, The Emperor Of Ocean Park is beautifully constructed and Carter proves to be a remarkably creative storyteller. I highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for a great law driven mystery with outstanding plot twists, well-written characters, and vividly defined scenery. I applaud Carter for devising a social commentary that remains true to the African American culture.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />Of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersive storyteller.

Surviving in an Amazing Universe	Seven year old Troy Tomler involuntarily embarks on an incredible journey when his family's minivan is carjacked - with him still inside! To the gas station,to the mall, and around town, readers travel with Troy and share in his discoveries and frustrations as he bravely faces dangers most seven-year-olds could not handle.  Yet, there is something very special and unique about Troy - he can only speak using vowels!  His restricted speaking abilities, however, do not hinder him from temporarily escaping the kidnappers, making friends, shopping alone and participating in a Christmas play. In spite of the disability most children and adults taunt him about, Troy proves to be a very smart, kindhearted, and fairly independent young boy.<br /><br />S. Kennedy Tosten has done an excellent job depicting the thoughts, feelings, and actions of autistic children and adults in this enjoyable, lighthearted children's book.  The story is told in first person from Troy's point of view, and, while adjusting to his voice and perspective might be difficult for some readers, the language of the story is very simple and easy to understand for children at almost any reading level.<br />I applaud Tosten's efforts in stepping out of the box and writing a children's book that increases awareness of autism and promotes acceptance of individuals dealing with the disorder by illuminating and discarding negative opinions.  Children (and adults) need to be more cognizant of differences within the human race and learn to embrace those differences in each other, even if they don't quite fully understand.  I highly recommend S. Kennedy Tosten's book TROY'S AMAZING UNIVERSE M FOR MALL to any parent looking to broaden their child's outlook on life with a fun-filled, action-packed story of a boy surviving in his own amazing universe.<br />Reviewed by Natasha T.<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
The Stowaway	Nelson Eubanks composed a symphony with his collection of short stories entitled THE FIRST THING SMOKING.  Filled with the sweet melodies, melancholy movements, and cacophonies that a recurring main character experiences throughout his life, this work takes fiction to new heights with its innovative prose, enthralling plots, and engaging characterizations.<br />Set in venues from New York to Brazil, THE FIRST THING SMOKING's central character Maceo is a protagonist with whom I could sympathize with, gape at, and learn to love.  The stories chronicle his life from a young child in New York, to an adolescent at his aunt's rural home, to a grown man in Brazil.  Injected between these stories of Maceo are short two page reflections on subjects such as young girls in Brazil being auctioned off to the highest bidder.<br />Eubanks' writing style is inventive and captivating; he uses short, sharp sentences for emphasis and effect. The delicious combination of the writing and the stories made THE FIRST THING SMOKING a bewitching experience that I would recommend to all readers.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
Ghosts of the past	Helene Strickland travels from her new home in Washington, DC to her childhood home in the Deep South after her Uncle Ed informs her that the aunt who raised her has passed away.  Upon her arrival, she comes face to face with some old demons that have haunted her her entire life. What happened to her father? Why did her mother give her away?  These are just a few of the questions that are left burning in her mind.<br /><br />Since Helene knows she wouldn't be able to get Ed to reveal the past to her, she decides to take a day trip to her mother's house in the small Arkansas town of Lafayette. What Helene finds there is the spirit of a six-year-old girl trapped in her middle-aged mother's body, the legend of her grandmother Liberty, and the remnants of the life of a man named Chess.  Still, Helene is determined to find out why things transpired the way they did. She's determined to find her roots.<br /><br />KNEE DEEP IN WONDER is a tragic novel about a family and the skeletons that most families harbor in their closets.  The writing is fluid and beautiful, yet poignant.  The story of the Strickland family is staggering, and Reynolds demonstrates in her book that some things are better left buried.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01

Sisters in Spirit	At first glance one would think that SISTERHOOD SITUATION by Janette McCarthy Louard is a typical book about four college seniors and their exploits.  That would be a wrong assumption because this book offers much more, including lessons to be learned by lending subtle and not so subtle messages, which can be enjoyed and savored by all.  SISTERHOOD SITUATION will take you back to your college days, and have you shaking your head and screaming out loud as each woman funnels through their trials and tribulations.<br />Reva, Opal, Precious and Faith are seniors at Middlehurst, an all women's college in Massachusetts. Despite the fact that each woman's background is different, they form a bond that is hard to break. SISTERHOOD SITUATION takes the reader on a journey through the senior year of the four protagonists and back in time during their upbringings in Harlem, Cleveland and Boston. Each woman has an appealing personality that, at times, allows her to feed off the other, and at other times, has her ready to strangle some common sense into the other.  As each woman's story is told, we get a chance to meet their parents and siblings, which helps to bring their personalities into focus and also assists with understanding some of the decisions each makes.  The reader is also treated with the insertion of the men in their lives, be it their fathers, brothers, boyfriends or associates.  Who are these men and how do they help shape these women?  As seniors do we see them come full circle; do we see their growth and do we witness what Middlehurst has offered them in terms of life lessons?<br />SISTERHOOD SITUATION is a familiar and enlightening read. Janette McCarthy Louard has penned a book with a continuous storyline that may have you wondering what will become of these four sisters in spirit.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Good Things Come To Those Who Wait	BECOMING WHOLE BEFORE BECOMING ONE is a candid and scripturally based book<br />about preparing oneself for marriage.  The author, Sandra Scott, shares<br />her personal story of overcoming an abusive marriage which she chose out of<br />loneliness and not out of God's perfect will or plan for her life.  Scott<br />describes the hardships that she experienced as a result of her rash decision.<br />Additionally, she discusses the various complexes that are evident in people<br />that cause them to make bad decisions when choosing a mate.  Stressing the<br />necessity for people to be biblically grounded and God-centered when embarking<br />on a quest for a mate, Scott makes her points by giving supporting scriptures<br />and using modern day parables that describe the situations that may be faced<br />by lost and lonely souls.<br />BECOMING WHOLE BEFORE BECOMING ONE is a refreshing and inspiring read.<br />I enjoyed the biblical references and the parables helped to illustrate her<br />points well.  Scott relies heavily on her personal experiences and as a result,<br />abusive situations get alot of attention.  I would recommend this book to<br />anyone who is comtemplating marriage.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
Historical Moments Recalled	LIVING IN THE SHADOWS OF A LEGEND by Deric Gilliard does an excellent job of chronicling the lives and times of twenty dynamic individuals whose self-less contributions added to the Civil Rights movement.  As an employee of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the organization co-founded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Gilliard had additional access and exposure to these stories that might have gone untold.<br />Most of these individuals were just everyday people who were catapulted into action as a result of the times in which they lived.  For example, in December of 1955 in the height of the Montgomery bus boycott, John Thomas utilized his personal vehicles to provide car service to many of the Montgomery citizens who participated in the boycott.  Thomas would ferry the riders back and forth to work each day subjecting himself to possible police torment.  There are other stories in this book, such as that of Anne Braden, a Caucasian activist writer, who worked side by side with Dr. King to fight Communist and other segregating activities.<br />This book is a definite read for individuals seeking to gain more knowledge of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement.  Gilliard has wonderfully captured the facts surrounding the events and has related these in an interesting and enlightening manner.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
The ties that bind	I've heard many women comment on the fact that a white woman and a black woman can never truly be friends because of the differences in everyday life that they experience.  Martha Manning's book A PLACE TO LAND proves this generalizing theory to be null and void.  Manning narrates the story of a budding friendship between herself, a forty-something white woman, and Raina, a younger unwed black mother of three small children.<br />It all started one Christmas when Manning, after winning a battle against depression, decided to participate in the Adopt-A-Family program in her area.  She was assigned to a family with twin babies, a little girl, and their mother.  Forced to drop off the gifts in person, Manning found the recipient of her gifts to be Tracy Raina Grant, better known to her friends as Raina.<br />Over the course of the next few months the women communicated via telephone for brief &quot;how do you do&quot; conversations.  It was at this point that I questioned the possibility of the two women becoming more than acquaintances.  However, I was proven to be drastically mistaken.  The Grant and Manning families melded into one large unit, breaking the barriers of class, and most surprisingly, race.  In fact, race was rarely a topic of conversation amongst them.<br />I was inspired by the ties that bound these two women together.  The Grant children were a joy to read about, and I even shed a few tears over the strong emotions I experienced while reading.  Manning's writing is conversational; I felt as if she were speaking directly to me, relating the events of her life with a touch of humor.  I recommend this book to friends, sisters, and sisterfriends alike for a new perspective on that thing we call friendship.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
NOT THE AVERAGE RELATIONSHIP NOVEL	Not your typical relationship novel, DATING GAMES has an extra pinch of something akin to what one finds in a thriller.  It's not the same ole, &quot;I lost my man, I want a man, or I don't need a man&quot; seen in contemporary relationship novels.  This book focuses on the importance of family, showing how our lives are truly a reflection of those we encounter, and the impact our actions have on those around us.  With witty dialogue, unforgettable characters, and a heart-stopping ending, DATING GAMES is sure to be a favorite amongst  R.M. Johnson fans.<br /><br />DATING GAMES starts off with the introduction of thirty-three year old Livvy Rogers, a single mother who wants to be a registered nurse. Livvy has had a rough life and has been very unlucky in love.  She is fiercely devoted to her twin daughters Hennesey and Alize, who are as different as night and day in attitude, demeanor, and their goals in life.<br />Hennessy's love interest Rafe is a recent parolee who is set on cleaning his life up and staying away from those people who could affect his probation.  Unfortunately, his parole officer has set him up with a job working with his old buddy Smoke, who appears to be legit on the surface but is still involved in illicit activity.<br />R.M. Johnson does a superb job in developing his characters so that each one comes across as being a uniquely memorable individual.  He also  manages to elicit sympathy for his characters, tossing them into unbelievable situations that leaves the reader praying that things will work out.  When the lives of these characters criss cross, this novel takes on the type of climactic ending only seen in a thriller. R.M. Johnson does not disappoint in creating conflict and setting about taking the reader on a journey that will change each of the character's lives forever.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Growing Up the Hard Way	MISERY LOVES COMPANY is a quick read that shares a first hand account of a young woman by the name of Kerri Mitchell.  The book is primarily set in the Washington, DC area and features many twists and turns as Kerri makes choices that often lead to difficult circumstances.  Kerri has grown up with a mother that has mental health issues and as a result she quite often was forced to fend for herself.  She and her friends  often get caught up in all sorts of criminal activity as a result of their wishes to obtain material things the easy way.  Perhaps the most challenging of situations for Kerri involve her teenage pregnancy, motherhood, and eventual marriage.  In her own mind, marriage would help provide her and her daughter with many of the comforts in life that she would otherwise have to struggle to obtain.  However, the marriage was not without problems and was wrought with physical and emotional abuse.  As the story progresses, we follow Kerri in a journey filled with ups and downs and readers will find themselves hoping that she will eventually find peace and make better decisions in the future.<br />This is the kind of book that will open the eyes of many as to the kind of circumstances that an impoverished young girl with an absent father and emotionally unavailable mother may have to encounter.  Thornton does an excellent job developing Kerri's character and as a result readers will feel as if she is someone they know personally.  The story is one that I found frustrating because when given the choice Kerri always seemed to make the bad decision and had to learn things the hard way.  The plot is fast paced with a number of twists and turns.  Although there were some aspects of the story that I felt were left hanging, I found this to be a satisfactory read over all.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01

It lies within?	INNER COACH, OUTER POWER provides answers to some of life's infinite<br />questions. Varnum offers interesting aspects on the untapped and uncharted<br />powers that humans possess. His book can be viewed as an awakening that<br />empowers people to create an alignment with their soul and their personality.<br />He narrates this personal story with life events that helped transform his<br />existence and he shares these experiences with vivid imagery and miraculous<br />offerings. Especially notable is how he cured himself of blindness. We all<br />possess paranormal powers that we allow to rise to the surface only when<br />dangerous or abnormal conditions exist. An example is when a frantic mother<br />can lift a truck and hold it aloft so her child can be pulled to safety.<br />Again he challenges that this is not extraordinary, it is actually quite<br />normal, quite ordinary. But the key to this is to choose life, over the<br />restrictions of the belief system, that has been handed down to us.  So with<br />this story and this book he shares the magic of inner power, and he invites<br />readers into his life and the miracles he expects daily in his world.<br />It is Varnums's contention that there is only one story, and that the<br />Universe is made of stories, not atoms. And he says &quot;As the outer<br />appearances of my narration reveal the inner agenda of my real self, you<br />may begin to see the common thread of soul intention running through the<br />surface appearances of your life.&quot;  Spiritualistic, inspirational and<br />holistic in a non-religious sense incarnates this compelling book.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
Lies, lies and more lies	Deceptions, be they intentional or not, can destroy families and friendships.

Crystal, Kiara and Shana have been friends since childhood.  All three of their lives are entwined in webs of deceit that slowly begin to unravel.  Once untangled, the lies have life changing effects on each of them.<br />Ms. Frances makes a good first attempt in the literary world with DELIBERATE DECEPTIONS.

To the heart of the matter...	Katilla Richardson is a nurse at Heartland Memorial with her sights set on furthering her career and being accepted into a Physician Assistant Program--one of the toughest since it only accepts a certain percentage of applicants.  She's fresh out of a bad relationship with a pro football player and convinced that all good men are taken.  Enter Dr. Kenneth Michaels; a doctor on staff who has turned bitter and arrogant since his wife's death.  He is also the &quot;key&quot; to Katilla making it into the Physician Assistant Program since he sits on the board of directors.<br />When thrown together to work on an emergency surgery, Katilla loses herself in Dr. Michaels and hatches a plan to seduce him in order to guarantee herself a slot in the Physician Assistant Program.  Unfortunately, he is not as willing to be seduced and seems a bit turned off by her boldness and obvious unprofessional tactics.  Lucky for Katilla, she's in the right place at the right time and immediately volunteers  when she hears  that his live-in housekeeper needs a nurse to help administer her insulin shots.  From there,  the fireworks begin and they start to really get close to each other.  And as expected, just when things are getting serious, someone from the past returns to reek havoc on their new feelings for one another.<br />With an abundance of characters and sub-plots to match, MATTERS OF THE HEART is a mostly fast-paced novel that is easy to follow and become consumed with. Sabrina McAfee does an outstanding job of mixing romance, suspense, and dialogue which helps the novel stand out amidst similar ones on the market.  While I loved the twists and turns the novel took, there were a few actions that seemed out of place with the main character.  It was very hard for me to see her portrayed as a loving, friendly person one minute and then the next as a manipulator  trying to use Dr. Michaels for her own advancement.  It simply didn't fit for me.  In spite of this, it will not hinder me from adding Ms. McAfee's book to my collection and anticipating  her next release.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Are you hungry?	Not only does Robert Swiatek give us a day by day menu along with the recipes, he makes it fun and entertaining as well. He starts by giving us a run down of when he first left home and had to learn how to cook. Mr. Swiatek tells us the pitfalls to watch out for - especially when baking bread. And he also tells us not to let a failure stop us from trying again because the only real reasons for not trying a recipe a second time is that your friends hated it or it was too long and complicated for the outcome.<br />Swiatek covers fifty-six days of recipes and menus, and descriptions of a few amusing disasters along the way. Like the spaghetti sauce that cooked so long all the bones in the turkey necks he used became soft and he had to toss it, or the chili that burned on the bottom and was ruined.<br />He doesn't have very many desert recipes so if that's what you're looking for, you might have to look elsewhere. Swiatek admits that deserts are not one of his favorite items.  All of his recipes are cost effective.<br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01
Honoring black men.	In this beautiful coffee table presentation, author Lana Reid beautifully, rhythmically, and respectfully declares her love for Black men.  Not only is the cover a wonderful work of art demonstrating the strength of a black man as he reaches out and holds a black woman in the palm of his hands, the poems also succinctly uplift the black man.  She talks of the hardships of loving them, the ease as well as conflict of understanding them, and finally, the beauty and intimacy that can result from loving them.<br />Simply put, MY LOVE NOTES TO A BLACK MAN is beautiful!  Ms. Reid's prose,  coupled with the appropriately disbursed charcoal drawings of black love, is breath-taking.

Be careful of what lurks in the shadows	Imagine watching all the young men in your life succumb to the lure of drugs, the perils associated with selling drugs and the seductive power of controlling their turf while you're too helpless to do anything but let them go and pray for their survival.  This is exactly what Loretta Patterson faces in ASCENDING SHADOWS.  She has long ago given up her husband, Leonard, to the call of alcohol.  Now the mean Washington, D. C. streets are trying to claim her sons, Maurice and Lemar, as well as their friends.  For various reasons, these young men are surrendering all they've learned and held dear to making fast money dealing drugs and protecting the hood.  In the constant battle to defend their turf, they've made enemies of close friends and law enforcement and these enemies will stop at nothing to destroy them.  They trust no one and are constantly looking out for the enemy that may lurk in the shadows any day of the week.  As the violence escalates, they each must make a choice between life and death.<br />In this fast-paced suspense novel, Michael Grayson has put together a good lesson of what's happening in the streets of many cities today.  He covers the full gamut of the seductive powers of drugs in the African American culture.  The main characters may have been looking in the shadows for an enemy with a face, but in another sobering sense, they were also looking inward to find the power to break the grip of years of self-destructive behavior.  I found this book to be very enlightening as well as thought provoking.  Although very violent at times, the realism portrayed in this book should be shared with the youth of today.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-11-01

This woman produces photographs of herself and Jonathan in the throes of passion.  But what really hurts Kari most is the fact that this woman, like her boyfriend, is white.  As a couple, Kari and Jonathan have lost friends, developed strained relationships with their respective parents, and at times have taken on what seems like their entire small town because of the fact that they are involved in an interracial relationship.

Am I my sister�s keeper?	Being a part of a set of twins has got to be one the hardest situations for children as they grow into adulthood.  In ROSES ARE THORNS VIOLETS ARE TRUE, Shelia Goss takes a very in-depth look at the lives of twins, Rose and Violet.  They are identical twins and that's where the similarities end.  They are as different as night and day.  Rose is very self-centered, jealous and devious.  Violet, on the other hand, is sweet natured, attentive and cares very deeply for others.  Even as little children, Rose was allowed to cast Violet in an unpleasant light using childish pranks that only twins can play.  Violet, however, was always expected to forgive Rose and move on.  Their parents and Rose expected her to always have her sister's back no matter the circumstances.  As they grew into adults it was easy to see that Rose coveted everything that Violet was and had.  But, there are some lines that sisters just don't cross.  Once that line is crossed, forgiveness becomes a little too hard to carry out.<br />In her debut novel, Ms. Goss weaves a fascinating tale that had me reading well into the night.  This was sibling rivalry at its worst.  The ending was not what I was expecting.  Instead, I received a lesson in familial love and forgiveness.  It left me rooting for both sisters to find that elusive happiness they both craved and a way back to each other.  This was a great read and I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Some of the suggestions that I found most helpful were, keeping a journal, being optimistic, and surrounding yourself with positive people.<br />I ALMOST MISSED MY LIFE, DON'T MISS YOURS: 52 SECRETS TO MORE SUCCESS, FUN &amp; FULFILLMENT is an inspirational story of one woman's determination to find happiness and to share her findings with others.

It's in the details	Jones' latest work is a myriad of characters, events, and places. While his main focus is on a few central characters, numerous secondary character come into play as he relates their life experiences in an eccentric, yet effective manner.  THE KNOWN WORLD is a vastly detailed account of the black slaveowner Henry Townsend and the saga that both follows and precedes his death.  Henry, a former slave on the large Robbins plantation, came into his own after being bought out of servitude.  He forged a strong foundation for his own family and future, but remained loyal to William Robbins, his former master.  He bought his first slave in his early twenties, and by the time of his death at 31 years old, he owned 33 slaves and a successful plantation that was fashioned upon both the slaves' love for their master and Henry's unbending will to please Robbins. Henry's illness and succeeding death were the impetus for chaos on the Townsend plantation as everyone knew it.  Moses, the overseer got mean and despondent, other slaves escaped under the cover of darkness, and a general feeling of foreboding hovered over both the slave cabins and the main house.<br />Jones did a fantastic job of relating the story of an elite class of free black slaveholders in Virginia that many accounts of the antebellum South have failed to acknowledge.  With his collection of short stories, Lost in the City, Jones used the Washington, DC setting as the backbone. In this novel, it is in the details that he writes of each character that we come in contact with that he builds upon.  The writing is reminiscent of jazz, with its riffs thrown in for both showmanship and for expression.  I was never left hanging, wondering what may have become of this character or that, as his or her life was related in the details of the plot, and even at times in their introduction into the story.  This is a book to read when you are searching for valuable lessons in history and the bonds that it both severs and forms.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersbr />Reviewed by CandaceK<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-27

Once there,<br />Claudia sits pensively, deciphering her feelings and thinking<br />that some changes are due in her life. She devises a plan; a list<br />of attributes she will use to grade the men she meets so she will<br />know immediately if they are acceptable suitors.<br />Ray hates the idea, but since he and Claudia have been platonic<br />friends since they were 10 years old, he doesn't know how to tell<br />her why he begrudges it. For a few years now Ray has been having<br />visionary creations about Claudia, every time he closes his eyes.<br />But, he's afraid a failed relationship will destroy their friendship.<br />The adage, 'can't see the forest for the trees' is personified in<br />this story as they continue to overlook the obvious. But a new<br />love interest for Claudia and an ex-love interest of Ray's may be<br />the catalyst needed to escalate their status beyond that of best<br />friends.<br />In SOMEONE TO LOVE, Alicia Wiggins has taken a predictable<br />scenario and created a sensitive and entertaing story.

Becoming a warrior for the Lord	In this classic tale of good versus evil, Terrance Johnson takes us on a journey into the underworld. The protagonist, Victor Daniel Hunt or &quot;Slick Vic,&quot; as he is known in the hood, is embarking on a journey that will either take him straight to hell or leave him sitting at the throne of God. He reigns supreme in the hood, using fear, sex, trickery, force and money to control his dominion. He is likened to a modern day Lucifer with an in depth knowledge of the Bible. He feels that God deserted him years ago during the times when he needed Him most. And he has carried this feeling like a badge for most of his life.<br />Slick Vic is surrounded by his wife, associates, friends and other family members that have all found their way to God. They each try to show him, in one way or another that he should turn away from his evil deeds and turn to God for salvation. Although he has a loving, spirit-filled wife, Shonda, a beautiful daughter and wonderful home, Vic still feels the need to fulfill his lustful urges with various women. Shonda continues to put up with his wandering ways until he does the unthinkable. Then it seems as if life as he knows it starts to take a downward spiral. Some friends become untrustworthy and some friends find that it is very deadly to know Vic.<br />In BAPTISM OF FIRE Mr. Johnson showed a great command of the Scriptures. The storyline, however, was a slow read at times and then a confusing one at others. This novel required a lot of concentration on the part of the reader. Although Mr. Johnson explains his use of different fonts in the foreword, the changes served as a point of confusion most of the time. It became hard to discern who was actually narrating the story or if one was in the past or the present.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-27
Do you know your history?	THE AFRICAN RISES is a mixture of history and fantasy. It is a story of how the African Diaspora and the upheaval of Africa in general came about. It also gives sharp lessons in how and why Africans are still so far apart in thinking and in being the great people they once were. It unequivocally points out how our history has been stolen not only by Europeans but also by Arabs, Greeks and Romans before the coming of the modern Europeans who wreaked havoc on the continent with slavery, colonialism, the Cold War and the rape of the natural resources. Beauregard also has harsh words for Arabs in the Sudan, Mauritania and other places where slavery still exists.<br />While the hero, Sekhem, uses magic to bring about understanding, cooperation and respect for the Africans and to get rid of corrupt governments, there are some hard lessons to be learned about Africans who have been dispersed all over the world. He also gives the Catholic Church grief about their actions through the centuries of keeping the Africans down.<br />While THE AFRICAN RISES is a fascinating story, it could have been much better with some standard editing. Sometimes commas came in unexpected places, changing the meaning of a sentence and causing confusion. Also some sentences should have been two or even three sentences. But all in all, it was a worthwhile read.<br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-27
For love of country or just for love.	BET is releasing a special Summer 2003 series dedicated to military<br />officers titled, 'At Your Service.' TOP SECRET RENDEZVOUS by Linda<br />Hudson-Smith is about Major Zurich Kingdom and Staff Sergeant Hailey<br />Hamilton, both members of the United States Air Force.<br />What started out as rest and relaxation on a remote island in Texas<br />snowballed into a liaison that would prove to be more secretive than<br />their top secret jobs. When Zurich and Hailey met, they were unaware<br />that either was enlisted in the armed forces they only knew that they<br />had found their soul mate. Ironically it was not until they were<br />stationed at the same base in Germany, that they became fully aware<br />that the other was in the Air Force and in the same career field.<br />Because of Air Force directives prohibiting fraternization between<br />Officers and Enlisted personnel, Zurich and Hailey know that their<br />rank will not allow the pleasures they shared to go beyond their<br />Texas hideaway. They try valiantly to honor their commitment to the<br />USAF regulations, because to disregard them could jeopardize their<br />careers; but how do you regulate your heart?<br />Ms. Hudson-Smith has crafted an amorous story of what happens when a<br />pledge of allegiance faces the ultimate test. But more than the test<br />of their reputation, she allows the characters to grow in a way that<br />inspires readers to view life in a less temporal and more ethereal way.<br />This is also wonderful exposure of the Air Force.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-27

Sims takes the reader on a journey through her life beginning with her early upbringing in the church, to her bouts with a bad marriage and crack addiction, and ends with her realization that the very thing she spent her life searching for was right there all along.<br />Spiritual, but not preachy, GOING ON ANOTHER WAY, shows that at one time or another we all make mistakes, but it is up to each individual to learn from their mistakes or be doomed to recreate them.  Sims' story often reads more like a diary or a vent than a novel, but it only makes the novel more gripping, inspirational, and real.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />Of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-27
I Am Always With You	Broken about his sexuality and his spirituality, Jefferson Daniels is a man living on the edge.  In the closet, out of the closet, losing his faith and gaining it back again is the prose of WHEN A MAN IS BROKEN by Kevin D.

When Jefferson attends a fraternity convention in Atlanta, his past comes back full force.  He struggles with who he is versus who he wants to be. He also struggles with his spirituality, often questioning God and the heavy load that he must contend with.  The most telling chapter is \\"My Present Begins With My Past.\\"  Jefferson highlights his life as a child in Philadelphia in an attempt for him to understand why and how he came to be.<br />Throughout the book are powerful poems and prayers that Jefferson writes and recites in an attempt to rectify his current situation.  Secondary characters in the form of his mother and his best friend Evelyn are highlighted in an honest and unforgettable manner.<br />WHEN A MAN IS BROKEN focuses on subject matters that some may find disturbing, while others may find that they are subjects that should be discussed more often.

Just enough for the city	It seems as though some of my favorite books of all time had a strong emphasis on the setting in which they took place.  Rainelle Burton ingeniously incorporated Detroit into her novel, The Root Worker. Zora Neale Hurston's writings were all heavily emphatic on the southern setting in which her characters resided. Not unlike these, Edward P. Jones' collection of short stories entitled LOST IN THE CITY not only uses Washington, DC as its backdrop, but the city's intricacies and nuances are woven together with each storyline he presents. He uses this setting so competently that we are led to the notion that the city of Washington itself is the protagonist as it jumps out as a recurring character in all of the pieces.<br />There truly wasn't one story that I felt lukewarm toward, however, some of them do stand out among the rest because of both their plots and characters. One of my favorites, entitled &quot;The Night Rhonda Ferguson Was Killed&quot;, was a day in the life of Cassandra, a tough teen who also happens to be the local vocal starlet's best friend.  Throughout the course of the story, Cassandra's personality came to the forefront, allowing the reader to walk with her through her adolescent journey.<br />Jones is a great writer, and an excellent storyteller.  His characters are the folks you know from next door, from down the street, or from the church choir.  Emblazoned with universality, even those who have never been to Washington will know how it feels to be lost in its grandeur. Edward P. Jones has a novel due out this year as well. You can trust that I will be reading it.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22
Having your cake	Hot is the only word to describe this sizzling page turner by Brenda Hampton.  In TWO'S ENOUGH THREE'S A CROWD, Ms. Hampton weaves a tale of one man having his cake and eating it too. Jaylin Jerome Rogers, the main character of the book, is what most men dream of being and most women should hate to see coming. Jaylin's intelligent, good looking and successful, but can't seem to be satisfied by one woman. He's got to have two or more women to take care of his many needs. But you have got to hand it to the brotha, he is honest with everybody. He lays the situation out and lets the women make their own choice.<br />The two main women in his life are both deeply in love with him and they each want to be Mrs. Jaylin Rogers. Nokea has known Jaylin since childhood and she is vying to be the number one woman in his life, but her problem in their relationship is a lack of intimacy. Nokea wants to wait until marriage to give it up. Felicia, on the other hand, is serving it up on demand. She feels that in the long run, as long as she is putting out regularly, Nokea will become a thing of the past. But then there is a twist; Jaylin meets Scorpio and she turns everybody's world upside down. Suddenly, it is very crowded in Jaylin's world.<br />Brenda Hampton gives a very real account of what's really happening in some relationships today. As Jaylin, Nokea, and Felicia tell their story, the reader can sympathize and understand how each one came to be in their particular situation. This is a great story about finding love, recognizing it, hanging on to it and all the drama that could go along in the process. It was very hard to put this one down. I kept thinking &quot;Oh My God&quot; Or &quot;No she didn't.&quot; I will definitely be on the look out for more from this author in the future.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Growing up young.	J. L. Woodson's English class project to write a short horror story, grew into a published book, THE THINGS I COULD TELL YOU. While his classmates wrote about 'Elm Street', his horror story was about the fear of living in a home with a physically abusive father, and how the family adjusted once the drama stopped. After witnessing too many fights and an near fatal shooting between his parents, Cameron and his sister are ecstatic when their mother leaves Chicago. She sheds the traditional family life, to create a better environment for the<br />three of them; And the move does wonders for the family's sanity.<br />Cameron, a very sensitive teenage boy, is serious as he shoulders his new responsibilities. He loves being the peacemaker between his mom and his sister, and he handles being a big brother with the right touch of warmth, compassion and teenage realness as he helps his sister adapt. Everyone is finally settling into the slower pace of the south and their life is good. It's been three years since their mom changed the family name and moved to Tennessee to escape their past; but somehow the past is back. Now Cameron is forced to make a deadly choice that could change his life.<br />Writing with finesse beyond his years, Woodson blends humor, reality and survival. He creates an inspiring story told with the innocent candor that can only exists when belief in humanity is still fresh. Teens will relate to the story because it is told by one of their peers. But this is a heads up read for adults as well; they are able to better understand what plays out in the minds of kids who have seen too much too soon. Woodson published this story when he was sixteen years old so I anxiously anticipate his growth as a writer.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22

Lytle uses a<br />series of poems, essays and short stories to delve into life on the<br />streets that he, himself, called home for many years. The imagery<br />shows a harsh portrayal of the drug dealings, drive-by shootings, the<br />constant hustling, prostitution and other terrible scenarios most<br />often associated with inner-city neighborhoods. Not only, are we<br />allowed a look at the individuals, but also a look into their minds,<br />seeing the reasons why some things are as they are in &quot;the hood.&quot;<br />Survival is at the forefront. There is a code to live and die by.<br />Mr. Lytle not only brings to life what happens on the streets, but he<br />also provides sage advice and encouragement for those seeking a way<br />out. As I read LOST SOULS, I could not help but to cheer for Shawn<br />Lytle as he has fought his way from the depths of the streets and is<br />trying to make a difference in the lives of &quot;his people.&quot; This<br />anthology should be required reading for anyone considering or<br />already living by the code of &quot;the hood.&quot;<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Spirituality primer	Reverend June Michael introduces her readers to the concepts of metaphysics, spirituality, and universal thought in her book PATH TO TRUTH: A SPIRITUAL GUIDE TO HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS. From the beginning of the book, she captures your attention as she tells of her own experiences in the spiritual world. The book is both an interesting reading experience and an eye-opening tell-all about spirits, souls, and life.<br />The first half of the book aims to familiarize readers with the concepts Michaels is trying to bring home, the origins of this school of thought, and the principles which govern the universe.  The author chronicles the different ages of the universe and lays the foundation for building spiritualism and a higher consciousness. In the latter part of the book, Michaels offers suggestions for how we can apply the principles learned to our own lives.  We are shown that each of our paths is unique, and that we should &quot;let go and let God&quot; in order to be steered in the right direction.  In addition, there is a wealth of affirmations, scriptures, quotes, and techniques for applying the theorems that are covered.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, as I have never really been exposed to this way of thinking.  I am always intrigued to hear about different spiritual experiences, and I think this book is a great place to start for those who are struggling with what they believe, yet it is also an excellent tool for even the experienced spiritualist.  I walked away with a better understanding of the ideas behind metaphysics and a platter full of food for thought.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22
September 12, 2001 and Beyond	September 11, 2001 was a day that changed the world forever. Two hijacked planes demolished the twin towers of the World Trade Center, another hit the Pentagon, and a plane full of heroes crashed in a lonely Pennsylvania field. The reality of the number of people who were killed or injured brought home how precious life is. Hearing of the thousands of people who were missing and the heartbreak of their loved ones was enough to devastate anyone. From that day forward, the world mourned the loss caused by the horrific acts of the terrorists.<br />In the days following the tragedy there were endless perspectives and commentaries offered, but the one that was not fully represented was that of African Americans. In THE PARADOX OF LOYALTY: AN AFRICAN AMERICAN RESPONSE TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM, edited by Julianne Malveux and Reginna A. Green, readers are offered a diverse collection of essays which cover every human emotion. The book also speaks of the changes that have been forced upon all Americans due to the September 11 tragedy. From more invasive searches at airports to additional security at major events, everyone is affected.<br />One of the stongest essays in this book is titled &quot;Necessary Changes,&quot; by Gail E. Mitchell with Andrea Benton Rushing. Ms. Mitchell is the definition of a survivor. She was blessed to survive both an earthquake and both attacks on the World Trade Center. Ms. Mitchell experienced a wide range of emotions, and the horrible events of September 11 are still with her to this day. Although she is working through her pain, grief, and anxiety, she realizes that she will never be the same person that she was before the terrorist attacks occured.<br />THE PARADOX OF LOYALTY: AN AFRICAN AMERICAN RESPONSE TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM is a book that I recommend that all Americans read, so that everyone's perspective is understood and represented.

Seeking Revenge	Claudia M. Dobson-Largie's novel, THE PAYBACKERS' CLUB, follows four young women who at first glance appear to have nothing in common. However, a closer look beneath the surface shows that all four women are dating friends and are all victims of domestic violence.<br />The novel is narrated by Melody, a successful young woman who comes from a loving family.  When Melody meets Leopold her life changes in more ways than she can imagine.  He is controlling, manipulative and eventually becomes abusive.

The women become fed up with the way their lives are going and begin to attend meetings for individuals who face domestic violence.  They also form THE PAYBACKERS' CLUB, a club where they exact ways to get revenge on their tormentors.  But one member's actions go too far, and the others are left to wonder if their club is responsible.<br />THE PAYBACKERS' CLUB shows the cycle of abuse.  Through Melody and Leopold's relationship, the author shows how domestic abuse manifests and the vicious cycle that it entails. Claudia M.

Making Holy Love	Ramona N. Bailey combines two seemingly opposite topics, sex and religion, to bring the extraordinary workbook, SEXPLOSION.  Bailey takes the controversial topic of sex and makes it less \\"taboo\\" by putting it into a biblical context.  The book is broken down into three unique parts that aim to make wives more sexually intimate in their marriages.<br />The first part of the book is \\"Abiding.\\"  This section focuses on the biblical background sex and sets a Christian foundation for exploring the topic of sex.  This section not only teaches God's words on sex, but also allows wives to look within themselves to discover any hindrances, physical, or emotional issues that may prevent them from being a totally uninhibited sexual being.  The second part of the book is \\"Serving.\\"  This section deals not only with serving God, but also serving your spouse.  The part also includes ways that women can ensure that their own desires and pleasures are being fulfilled.  The last part of the book is \\"Knowing.\\"  The section educates wives on the male and female anatomy and also includes several illustrations and descriptions of various sexual positions.<br />SEXPLOSION is an excellent resource for all women.  It contains aspects of self-help, sexuality, and most importantly religion.  Through her book, Ramona N. Bailey shows that sexual relations in marriage are healthy, necessary, and in accordance with what God has willed.  Bailey demystifies sex and debunks myths surrounding it, while at the same time putting God first.  SEXPLOSION is a must read for all Christian wives seeking to improve their relationships with God and with their spouse.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22

Utilizing the Power Within	POWER OF LIFE: USE IT OR LOSE IT YOU DECIDE by Rashun Jones is a small self-help book full of information for reclaiming the power within you.  Rashaun lays before our eyes the power of personal effectiveness, the power within our relationships, handling our anger in an appropriate manner, the power of forgiveness, the power of journal writing and the power of financial fitness.<br />Each chapter offers techniques and affirmations to be used to assist you in achieving your goals and why it is necessary for a healthy mental and physical life.  Also, sprinkled throughout are several poems that are appropriate to the chapter in question.  My favorite and the most helpful chapter is the Power of Forgiveness.  Often we hear why it is necessary to forgive, but this chapter offers another look at forgiveness as opposed to acceptance and offers assistance in letting go and moving on with your life.<br />What I enjoyed immensely was the fact that the book is small in stature, thus not intimidating to the novice reader and it is a book that you may pick up again to reference and reaffirm your beliefs, thus increasing the strengths within.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Fantasy�or fact?	THE 51ST AND 52ND STATES is a quick slide into a fantasyland of the Haves and the Have Nots, or in McKinnie's language, the Spers (Prosperity) and Povs (Poverty). Or is it more reality than fiction? The Spers have everything their hearts desire and more. They start off with lots of money and they are taught how to make it grow. Their schools are top notch with small classrooms and three teachers in each room who care about the students. Every Sper student uses the world as a learning experience. They don't merely read about the Serengeti, they actually go there on field trips. Networking is encouraged so that they will be able to make the right business partners when they complete college and are in charge. By contrast, the Povs have dilapidated schools, large classes with one overworked teacher and few courses that will prepare them for college. Several of the Pov high schools are actually vocational schools or schools to train athletes and musicians. Povs are taught to work, not to think critically. They need to take orders without question when they are on their future jobs and so that is the goal of their education. The Povs can aspire to become Spers but it will never happen. The wealthy make sure of that by stacking the laws against the poor so they can never leave poverty and gain prosperity. Spers break the law and maybe an eyebrow or two will be raised. A Pov breaks the law and gets the death penalty.<br /><br />McKinnie uses his lively imagination to fictionalize the truth about the stratification of society and he also shows how hard it is to go from one stratum to another, especially up from poverty. He even includes an exercise at the end so you can determine whether you are a Sper or a Pov. It is a quick and entertaining read. It could have used some closer editing but the reader still got the point.<br />Review by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22
Love vs. Deception	In his adult life Rhys Wielde is the CEO of the company he developed to merge computer technology and biology in such a way that will allow for positive human advancement.  When Rhys learns that one of his hand selected employees is responsible for developing a dangerous new drug he joins the team of DEA investigators committed to identifying and punishing the guilty parties.  It is through his work with the DEA that Rhys meets Skye, the DEA agent assigned to protect him.  However, because Skye often relies on the use of secret identities in her work, it is not until several encounters that Rhys learns who she really is.  As the two travel from state to state and country to country, they must trust and rely on one another for their own safety.  Through their adventures they soon realize that their attraction to one another cannot be denied.<br />DECEPTION'S GUARD has a hearty portion of adventure coupled with plenty of romance.  The author's vivid descriptions of the various settings of the book bring the locations and their respective culture alive.  While the adventure aspects of the book kept the story going, I found myself getting frustrated by the slow development of the romance plot.  In addition, I would have liked a little more back story on Skye's life so that I could better understand her motivations and actions.  In spite of these things, the book is an admirable freshman effort for Randolph that is worth checking out.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22
Chasing a Dream	Skip is a young sharecropper who picks cotton for a living, but he has big dreams thanks to an ad he read for Ezekiel Washington's Colored Acting School.  He aggressively saves money so that he can send in his five dollar registration and head to Hollywood to make his dreams come true.  After an adventurous trek to California, Skip soon discovers that realizing his dream to become a respectable actor will not be as easy as he had imagined.  Acting jobs are few and far between, and he is also forced to decide whether he really wants to hold out for respectable roles or settle for more readily available roles that embrace the negative racial stereotypes of blacks.  In the process, Skip learns many lessons about life, love, and friendship.<br />WALK LIKE A NATURAL MAN chronicles Skip's journey into manhood.  The author weaves an intricate tale that highlights the various moral struggles that one must face in the journey of life.  Thompson has done a good job bringing the social issues of the early 1900's to light while telling a story that is deeply emotional for the characters involved.  His use of descriptive language paints of vivid picture of the wardrobe, music and social climate and in the process brings the times to life.  This is not a fast paced read; rather it is one to be savored.  Thompson has brought a fresh new voice to African American fiction writing and indeed is an author to watch.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-22
A Mother�s Story	MY HEART WILL CROSS THIS OCEAN is Kadiatou Diallo's story.  In her memoir, she rejects the label of herself as the bereaved mother of her slain son, Amadou Diallo and defines herself as a woman of courage who triumphs over adversity. She shares her life and history in vibrant, lyrical detail.  As I read her<br />words, I felt like she spoke them to me and I was lulled into a comfortable trance by what felt like her soothing Guinean dialect.<br />Ms. Diallo shares her humble beginnings as a child in Guinea, Africa and gives a picture of her family and the political climate of that region at the time. By telling her story, she tells Amadou's story.  Despite the rich cultural text and vivid detail of her youth and growth into womanhood, I read with<br />baited breath because I knew eventually the story would arrive at February 3, 1999.  The day that her courage and strength would be thoroughly tested.<br />MY HEART WILL CROSS THIS OCEAN  is a mother's story, it is poignant and filled with cultural details. It movingly chronicles the life of Kadiatou Diallo, a woman who should not be pitied, but heralded for her courage and honesty in this portrayal.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-18
A Blueprint For Success	ACHIEVEMENT MATTERS by Hugh B. Price is a blueprint or step-by-step guide for parents and students alike to utilize for educational success cumulating in success in life. Sounds simple, right?<br />ACHIEVEMENT MATTERS is written in a simplistic manner and appears easy enough for many to understand.  Within this text Mr. Price, former President and CEO of the National Urban League, points to all entities responsible for a child's success in school and methodically explains their role in this success.  Highlighted are some of the successful educational programs the National Urban League facilitates throughout the country through their affiliated chapters such as Standards Keeper and Read and Rise.  Read and Rise appears as an appendix and is a great resource for parents and teachers.  ACHIEVEMENT MATTERS goes as far as presenting statistical data on the poor state of public education, especially within the large and small inner cities and rural areas, throughout the country.  Also highlighted is the necessity for parents of affluent school districts to keep an eye on their children and teachers.  These schools have a tendency to allow average students to fall through the cracks and place their concentration on high achievers.<br />One area that resonates throughout the text is that education starts at home and long before a child enters school and day care.  Parents and caregivers are a child's first teachers. Other areas brought to the foreground in the book include critical ages for healthy development, parental involvement with constructive and respectful collaboration, parents being leaders by example, raising parent and teacher expectations on children and reading comprehension skills.<br />One question I had that was not answered is-what can be done with students that start behind the eight ball at birth-no parental support, drug addicted parents, no extended family, transient life style, defeatist attitude and the list goes on.  What can be done? I highly recommend ACHIEVEMENT MATTERS for parents, students, teachers administrators, churches and community groups. Purchase the book, read it and refer back to it often.

The house on the hill	Sitting in the home I live in, which was built in the 1930s, I often ponder the saying &quot;if these walls could talk.&quot;  I can only hope that the things that Tananarive Due describes in THE GOOD HOUSE would not be among the tales my house would tell.<br />Angela always loved the house where her grandmother lived in a rural Washington town named Sacajawea. She came of age there and experienced her first love on the land surrounding it. The house was a place where townspeople would come for cures to their ailments in the form of teas that Angela's grandmother Marie concocts.<br />Now that Angela is grown and Marie has passed, she brings her son Corey to the house each summer to keep him off the streets and out of trouble at home in California.  But on one fateful Fourth of July, Angela's feelings toward the house change dramatically when she finds her son has killed himself in the wine cellar.<br />Distraught over the death of her only son, she checks herself into a mental facility for three months.  After she is released, the house in Sacajawea sits empty on its hill in the small town while she founds a budding entertainment agency. After the caretakers she hired call her to tell her that someone is interested in buying the house, Angela's friend and client Naomi convinces her to take one last trek to the house that took her son to determine whether she wants to sell the place or not. What Angela finds there is a mighty evil that has been feeding off of her tragedy and that it will take an equally mighty power to destroy it.<br />THE GOOD HOUSE is one of those books that make you jump while reading.  Beware of creaks in your house while indulging, as they are apt to give you a strong case of the &quot;willies.&quot; This is horror at its best and I await with bated breath the next release from this extraordinary writer.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-18
Life lessons learned	We all have the potential of making stupid choices in life, but it's how we ultimately deal with the consequences of those choices that make us who we are.  In this inspirational and uplifting autobiography of H. Marie Brown, we are given the chance to look inside the life of one woman, her choices and the results of those choices.<br />In WHEN THE COMPASS OF MY LIFE GOT STUCK ON STUPID, Ms. Brown gives a very honest account of her life and how she made it from being one step above homelessness to an honored guest of the President of the United States.  Her journey was one of bad choices, lessons learned, healing processes and eventually becoming a champion of women on welfare everywhere.  Her struggles with bureaucracy and a desire to make a better life for her family took her through things like emotional and physical abuse aimed at both her and her children and abuse by the very governmental system that was designed to help women in her situation.  And yes, there were times when you wanted to stay \\"stupid, stupid, stupid.\\"  After finally coming to terms with the cards she had been dealt, Ms. Brown chose to do something with her life and not give up to become just another poverty statistic.  She desired more out of life, especially for her children.<br />This book will have you looking within yourself and questioning where your compass is at this moment.  Brown closed the novel with eleven lessons learned called \\"The Eleven Steps to Achieve Success.\\"  These steps could be the blueprint for getting the \\"compass spinning\\" again in anyone's life. In this poignant account of Ms. Brown's life, I often pondered how someone could continue to make such bad choices time and again.  But at the same time I witnessed the growth that was attained with each lesson she learned from her experiences as she was able to \\"get her compass spinning again.\\"  This is an inspiring must read for all women that should also be shared with their daughters.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M.

Self Discovery with a Supernatural Flair	PICKING CHRYSANTHEMUM opens with stirring post Civil War scenes that take place in the late 1800's.  The scenes, which relate the story of how one African American woman tries desperately to protect her son, will captivate readers and leave them breathless and emotionally spent.  Then the author plunges into the present, and introduces Chrysanthemum, a white woman, in an unsatisfying marriage, who suffers from debilitating back pain with no known cause.  Eventually she seeks the help of an unconventional Hindu doctor, Dr. Deshpande, to find the root of her pain and a cure.  The doctor, who is a firm believer in reincarnation, presents his theory behind Chrysanthemum's pain but his theory is a little more than she is ready to handle.  In the meantime, her marriage has gone from bad to worse.  So when her mother asks Chrysanthemum to stand in for her at an annual Founder's Day Festival that honors her great-great Grandfather Clayton Jackson, she reluctantly agrees and looks forward to the chance to get away.  During the visit, family secrets and supernatural gifts passed down through the generations are slowly revealed.  As a result of the trip, Chrysanthemum begins to tap into her personal strengths and as a result many of the things that she once felt were impossible begin to become reality.<br />As the story of Chrysanthemum unfolds, readers may find themselves scratching their heads and wondering how her story relates to the opening scenes.  However, the author has a deliberate plan and slowly he weaves a tale that will connect the two seemingly unrelated stories in a creative and shocking manner.  Hampton has written a novel that is filled with themes of history, secrecy, and supernatural connections to the past.  The result is a story that will keep you turning pages and at times fill you with an eerie sense of terror.  With so few African American novelists delving into the supernatural, the book is a breath of fresh air for readers looking for a different sort of read.  In addition, to the supernatural themes, the story addresses relationship issues, and the very human theme of finding true individual happiness and peace.  P.L. Hampton is definitely an author to watch and I look forward to his future literary endeavors.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersrt of read.

Kimberly Brown has been with Malik for years and senses that something is not right with their relationship, although he has proposed.  She soon finds herself in a tug-of-war with Shonda for Malik's heart.<br />Told from the point of view of the two ladies, the story uniquely shows the affects that infidelity can have on relationships.  Poignant and entertaining, GOT A MAN, takes the reader into the psyche of women who engage in and put up with cheating in relationships.<br />Daaimah S. Poole's sophomore novel aims to please.  It is dramatic, quick read that shows the emotions and the real consequences of what happens when one man loves two women.  It is a must read for any one looking for an entertaining, relationship-based read, or anyone who has dealt with infidelity in a relationship.  I hope that the author considers writing a sequel to this novel.  It would be interesting to see the impact of the choices that were made in the conclusion of GOT A MAN.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />Of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
Family Drama	SHATTERED DREAMS is a perfect synopsis of the ideal life pictured by Felicia Wainwright.  Here she is the beautiful, housewife of a very successful, very handsome lawyer who adored her.  A loving family surrounds them, yet she couldn't have the one thing that would complete her role as a woman.  As desperately as Felicia and Warren had tried to conceive, they found that they were unable to do so by some of Felicia's own personal ailments.<br />The news of her inability to conceive because all-consuming, sending Felicia into a tailspin.  Ultimately, it causes some deep self-reflection for both Felicia and Warren.  Eventually, they are confronted with the crossroads of leaving their marriage or wrapping it all back together again.  They hit some serious bumps along the way that seem all-too-predictable.<br />Ms. Hayes has a good story line overall, but I did truly think this book was predictable and there were some convenient fixes to otherwise difficult situations.  Since the basis of the book revolved around Felicia's inability to conceive, I felt more time discussion should have been given to the specific reasons of her problems.  In doing so Ms. Hayes may have been able to develop somewhat deeper, more believable characters.  All in all, I still thought SHATTERED DREAMS was a good read and found myself wanting to know what would happen next to the Wainwrights.<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
God's Help	Stories from the Holy Bible have always provided inspiration, spiritual guidance, and comfort. BLESSED ASSURANCE: INSPIRATIONAL SHORT STORIES FULL OF HOPE &amp; STRENGTH FOR LIFE'S JOURNEY, a Christian Fiction anthology tells some of these same stories with a contemporary twist. All the stories are exciting reads and are well written, and while all of them were inspiring,the one that touched me the most was &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; by Victoria Christopher Murray. The message in this story is that we should be happy with what God has given us rather than harping on what we don't have.<br />&quot;The Best of Everything&quot; is based on the story of Hannah. At a glance it appears that that Hannah Covington is content. She has financial security and  is married to the man of her dreams, but Hannah is very unhappy, she yearns for a child. Unfortunately, pregnancy does not come easy for her and she allows this desire to consume her, which starts to affect other areas of her life.  This story is just one example of the spiritual food for thought that you will get from this wonderful collection of stories.

The circle of life	Four men growing up in New York City learn about life, love, and loneliness in THE LONG BLUE MOAN, an insightful novel by author L.M. Ross.  The story itself is told in a series of flashbacks and remembrances about the lives of these four men intertwined by, at times, friendship, and at other times, much more.  The men, both as individuals and as a unit, represent the hard times and struggles of young black men in the 1980s and 1990s.<br />Browny is a thuggish young man with the voice of an angel.  All he wants is to be able to showcase his talents and to be appreciated for them. He refuses to be punked by anyone.  But Browny is quick to take people on their word, causing him more trouble than anything.<br />Face Depina relies on his looks to get ahead in life. A man with the face and body of a god, many people flock to him for all the wrong reasons.  The hard countenance that Face shows the world is lined with that of a broken spirit, a scarred man, and an abandoned child.<br />Tyrone is the father figure of the group. He is a cautious, talented man who searches for more than just one night stands and fly-by-night relationships. He wants a man who is spiritually connected with him; his soul mate.  But a series of events cause Tyrone to question the validity of his desire to love and be loved.<br />David, an expert dancer, looks for love in all the wrong places, including in Face Depina. His carefree attitude about shacking up and going on the prowl for fresh meat makes his best friend, Tyrone, uncomfortable.  But David represents loyalty in its purest form, standing by his homies in good times and bad.<br />What we see from the collective of these men is a gritty tale of gay urban life.  Ross constructs these characters with depth and strong voices, and they all want to be heard; they demand it. There are a lot of sexual situations in this book, but they aren't thrown in there for shock value. Each episode plays a significant role in the makeup of the characters.<br />This emotional rollercoaster disguised as a novel is one that I was glad I had the chance to ride. I was educated and intrigued. I was saddened and outraged. I was a passenger and I loved every minute of it.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersr />This emotional rollercoaster disguised as a novel is one that I was glad I had the chance to ride.

A Different Kind of Vision	As a writer and lover of poetry, I always enjoy reading and discovering the latest thoughts from my fellow poets. Hearing their words is always an inspiration; however, I received a different kind of vision with Gregory Bryant and his poetic work, VISIONS.<br />Separated into three parts, VISIONS offers a variety of poetry that explores dreams &amp; fantasies, erotica, and realism.  Included in the collection are \\"Life's Highway,\\" \\"Love's Passion,\\" and \\"Untitled,\\" each featured in the book's respective sections. Although Bryant bares honesty through each poem, my only criticism is that I felt his work to be more of his \\"free thoughts\\" than poetry. I experienced a very difficult time seeing a clear connection and by the book's end, I was left with great disappointment.<br />Although Bryant offers a commendable effort, VISIONS is one collection that is on a completely different level as compared to contemporary poets, past and present. VISIONS is a collection that, in its own way, is in a league of its own.<br />Reviewed by Kanika A. Wade<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14

The story picks up with some familiar faces from God Don't Like Ugly and includes a few new characters for a little extra spice.  The protagonist, Annette Goode is still plagued by memories of her abuse at the hands of Mr. Boatwright and the devious deeds that her best friend Rhoda performed.  Annette also has unresolved feelings towards her father for abandoning his family for a white woman.  Because of all the pain and grief she has endured, this novel finds a stronger, more confident Annette who is able to cope with all the twists, turns, and pitfalls that life has to offer.  In this novel, she will learn about true love, true friendship, and the lessons that you cannot escape from your past and that \\"what goes around comes around.\\"<br />Although a sequel, GOD STILL DON'T LIKE UGLY, recounts much of the story for new readers without being redundant.  It is definitely a stand-alone book.  If you did not read the first novel, you will not be lost trying to figure out characters or plots in order to follow the story line.  Mary Monroe has again woven a cast of colorful, unforgettable characters.  She intertwines humor and a bit of romance while tackling intense social issues such as rape, child abandonment, prostitution, and racial tensions.  Fans of Monroe will be delighted with her newest novel.

The truth shall set you free	Shelley Parris' first novel, IN THE EYES OF TRUTH, takes an intriguing look into the misery that can be caused by going through life with blinders on and failing to confront the cause of the misery.  Nina Montgomery, once a teen mother, has always been on the run.  She has been running away, since the age of fourteen, from the source of physical and emotional abuse and is running from the demons of abandonment and betrayal.  In her<br />bid to escape, Nina has made some very bad choices in her quest to find love and ease the pain.  As a result, she has led a drama-filled life.  Zoe, Nina's thirteen-year-old daughter, has witnessed all the drama with the wisdom of a thirty-year-old woman.  Zoe has experienced first-hand her mother's flight from one man to another or from one home to another.  She has seen the physical abuse, helped her mom through the rough periods and been the recipient of many broken promises.  As Zoe vows not to be like her mother, she is ready for her to stop running and settle down to a normal life.  Zoe's chance at normalcy comes from an unlikely source, a grandmother she doesn't really know.<br />Anna Montgomery is Nina's very ill and estranged mother.  The two have had no contact for fifteen years and both harbor deep resentments for the other.  Out of the blue, Anna offers to allow Nina and Zoe move in with her in Florida so they both can leave the fast-paced life of New York.  It is in Florida that the source of unspoken pain and misunderstandings from the past catch up with both Anna and Nina.  They both must face the truth to heal their relationship before it's too late.  Nina must also find the courage to face another demon from her past and tell Zoe the truth even though it may hurt a lot of people.  Nina finds the courage to face all of her challenges by turning to God and seeking His strength to fortify her.<br />Both Nina and Zoe take turns telling this fascinating tale of discovering and conquering the truth.  As each character speaks, the reader becomes immersed in their feelings.  My heart went out to Zoe because she continued to think positively about her future in spite of the fact that she was so young and forced to think like an adult while dealing with the broken promises.

Where are We Going?	TROUBLE MAN tells the story of two men leading very different lives.  Jermaine Banks grew up in the streets of Philadelphia.  Now he is knocking on thirty's door and helping to raise his son, dealing with a temperamental and pregnant girlfriend, and keeping his business as a drug dealer going.  When he begins thinking about finding legitimate employment, Jermaine realizes that with minimal education and no work experience his options are limited and unappealing.  Jermaine is at a crossroads and must determine which path he wants the rest of his life to take.  Calvin Sharpe on the other hand has lived his life with money as his number one priority.  As a result, he has a thriving business, more money than he can ever spend, an unhappy marriage, and a son who detests him.  It isn't until his past begins to catch up with him that Calvin begins to realize all that he gave up in exchange for his love of money.  But is it too late to make amends?<br />Travis Hunter's latest literary offering, TROUBLE  MAN, is a satisfying read filled with strong themes of manhood and fatherhood.  I really enjoyed how he fittingly incorporated many of Marvin Gaye's song titles into the titles of various chapters in the book.  The tight character development helped readers really understand the motivations of the characters and made them easy to empathize with.  In addition, Hunter helped readers understand the dichotomy between inner city life and a more privileged life.  He demonstrated how environmental influences can have a major impact on the hopes and dreams of people.  Finally, through this story Hunter teaches us that decisions made in the past can have a lasting impact on the future.  I thoroughly enjoyed this stirring and emotional book and I highly recommend it to others.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />Of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14

Blacks In The Bible	In biblical history, it has been traditionally shown that Jesus and the other major figures in the HOLY BIBLE are white. However, in Ernest Sargent III's, THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN JERICHO, he offers a different perspective in which the role of Blacks is more prominent.<br />In Jericho c.1224 BC, two Israelites spies sneak into the home of Rehab, a famous Canaanite prostitute. Rehab's home is always the center of activity; therefore, it is the perfect hiding place for spies. She has no problem hiding these men but she does make a deal with them; in exchange for hiding the spies, Rehab wants to spare the people living in her home any harm. The Israelites agree and thus the course of biblical history is changed forever. As readers, we learn of the hue of Jesus' skin and about Black Israelites, who are also referred to as Black Jews.<br />THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN JERICHO is an informative book. From reading this book, I am even more proud to be a Black woman. My biggest issues with this book were that at times I felt that the writing was over my head and I often had to reread passages. So in essence, I would have liked the terminology to be a little simpler. However, for another view of biblical history, I feel that every African American should read this book.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
A Living Heroine	When thinking of a list of significant Civil Rights leaders, Betty Kilby Fisher's name may not immediately come to mind.  However, the sacrifices that Betty and her family made are immeasurable because of their lasting impact on Virginia's public school systems.  In WIT, WILL &amp; WALLS Betty Kilby Fisher shares a brief snapshot of her life.  In the beginning of the book she shares her family's background by telling about the early lives of both of her parents.  This background information provides a backdrop for the rest of her story because it helps readers better understand the goals and aspirations of her parents as they shaped the lives of Betty and her siblings.  Next, she relates stories of her early childhood.  During this phase of the book the author not only sheds life on her family life, but she also paints a vivid portrait of what the African American community was like when she was young.  One of the culminating points of the book begins when Betty is set to begin high school.  Despite the fact that the Brown vs. Board of Education decision ruled that segregated schools were unconstitutional, Betty's local high school in Warren County, Virginia remained segregated and black children were required to travel huge distances to attend Manassas Regional High School.  At this point her father, along with others in the community, decides to take a stand and fight to desegregate the local school.  The story doesn't end here though, as the author concludes the book with an overview of her adult life and the \\"battles\\" she had to continue fighting.<br />There were times in the book where I felt that it seemed more like a public record because the author spent too much attention documenting the factual details of a particular event. I would have preferred more of her personal story and the emotions that she and those close to her experienced.  These portions of the book interrupted the overall flow, caused the story to drag, and weakened the emotional intensity of the story.  In spite of this, I enjoyed reading the book and felt like I learned a great deal of valuable lessons in morality, tenacity, and history.  Being born and raised in Northern Virginia and having had many relatives attend Manassas Regional High School made this story more real to me and allowed it to touch me in a deeply personal way.  I thank the author for sharing her painful yet triumphant story with readers.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersof the story.

Born Too Soon	Flora McAndrews is on her way to a new and better life with her husband, when he suddenly and inexplicably drops dead from a heart attack.  So it is that Flora, &quot;an attractive woman with stunning blue eyes,&quot; finds herself faced with the prospect of sustaining herself in a vast unsettled wilderness, fraught with dangerous wildlife and the barest of essentials necessary for survival.<br />Chester is the third generation offspring of African Royalty of sorts.  His grandmother, the daughter of an African chief was captured, savaged and enslaved by her Anglo-Saxon captors.  Thus Chester, the grandchild of this grievously wronged aristocrat turned slave woman, is born on a plantation whose owner believes in educating and treating his slaves humanely.  Standing at well over six feet tall, with an uncanny aptitude for learning, Chester is his master's favored slave.  Chester becomes the companion of his master's only son, partly because<br />the improbable pair share a passion for hunting. While on a hunting expedition, the master's son is accidentally shot, and Chester, realizing his predicament and knowing that he would most likely be blamed and unjustly punished for his friend's unfortunate demise, opts to run away.<br />After enduring numerous hardships, fate eventually brings Chester and Flora together in what should have been the quintessential love story.  They almost immediately fall deeply and truly in love, but alas the ill-fated lovers are born too soon.  Living at a time when their liaison is deemed intolerable by the evil social structure of the period, their relationship appears to be doomed.<br />Ten Thousand Acres is a chilling chronicle of the lives of two unlikely lovers, and their struggle to overcome the harrowing harshness of the American Frontier, during one of the harshest and darkest periods in American history.  Preston Corbett presents the reader with the opportunity to reflect on the horrifically dehumanizing impact of slavery on individuals, and perhaps attempt to make sense of a senseless period in our history.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersals, and perhaps attempt to make sense of a senseless period in our history.   <br />Reviewed by Autumn<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
What Goes Around, Comes Around	Little girls are being kidnapped and murdered in Greasy Plank, a small suburb of Memphis, Tennessee.  All of the town's men are suspected, although all leads point in the direction of white, all-powerful Jack Robinson and his lackey, Ramsey Armstrong.  The novel follows several generations of townspeople, including Ramsey's family and the Tilsons, another prominent family in Greasy Plank. The story shows what can happen when families keep secrets and the repercussions that may occur because of them.<br />Laced with history and mysticism, the novel has twists and turns that keep it exciting.  My only criticism is that the book has so many characters that it is often confusing trying to keep track of them and their relationships.  I look forward to future works from denise turney.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy	2003-09-14
Heart to Heart	ANYONE WHO HAS A HEART explores the lives of three interconnected characters: Theresa, Zenobia, and Vince.  The author seamlessly allows each character to speak to readers directly by organizing the book in such a way that each chapter is told from one of their points of view. Each of the characters is trying to find true love while dealing with their own unique issues which serve as roadblocks in their quest.  Theresa is struggling to get over a past relationship, to raise her son, and to determine whether or not her significant other, Vince, is sincere and will really be there for her through thick and thin.  Vince strives to maintain his relationship with Theresa and feels that he is in a no-win battle with her past.  He wants to do whatever he can to help catapult her out of the prison of her past, so that the two of them can have a real shot at a relationship.  But Vince also has some skeletons in the closet of his past, which at times has him questioning his very identity.  Zenobia is also a single mother, but she seems inextricably connected to her baby's father in an almost dependent way.  Haunted by her past mistakes and lacking the confidence to truly free herself from this relationship, she is stuck in a rut.  As she searches for a true love of her own, she must deal with her general distrust of men, as well as her own insecurities.  Readers will find themselves turning pages as they follow these characters on their respective journeys to find love.<br />Jacqueline Powell has done it again with her latest novel, ANYONE WHO HAS A HEART.  In this book she tackles many difficult topics including, the search for love, infidelity, HIV, alcoholism, and dealing with past hurts.  Through her characters she reminds readers that anyone who has a heart will make mistakes and at times get hurt.  The characters are well developed and readers can easily relate to them.  I found myself understanding and empathizing with the mistakes the characters made and cheering them on when they made good choices.  Ms. Powell tackles so many real life issues in the story, yet she does it in such a way that the powerful lessons and messages are implied, rather than coming across as preachy.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerson when they made good choices.

Pick-Up	Leron King never imagined that a meaningless one night stand would transform itself into his own personal Hell.  However, the woman with whom he had the escapade didn't consider it such a meaningless event. In the midst of finding a woman who he genuinely cares about, Leron's past comes to haunt him in the form of a would-be stalker who is out for revenge.<br /><br />Michelle didn't consider herself a needy person, but her fianc&eacute;e Greg crossed the line when his work consumed him and left no time for him to spend with her.  She must come to a decision of whether or not she wants to be in a relationship with an absentee boyfriend.  Leron and Michelle met by happenstance; it was a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu type of meeting that makes one ponder the concept of destiny.  Having run into each other twice, in the lobby of Michelle's office building and on one of Leron's client visits, they took their chance meetings a step further and built a foundation of friendship, and, later, romance.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspectives of both Leron and Michelle, allowing the reader to form a more personal relationship with both protagonists.  Nevertheless, I still didn't feel like either character had a strong voice and it sometimes took a few paragraphs at the beginning of each chapter before I was sure of who was narrating.  The book built up to a strong climax, but I closed it feeling a bit disappointed that it had ended. I wanted to know more about what took place after the plot had thickened, but felt as if I were left hanging.

Reading enriches life	Book Club should capture the attention on the numerous literary/reading<br />clubs because it is a candid look at what members gain from book clubs.<br />CLUB ONE: B.E.L.L.E.S. (Beautiful Elegant Literary Ladies) - Atlanta, GA<br />A more fitting name would be Bourgeois Expensive Literary Ladies,<br />because these fun-loving members exert more energy making each meeting<br />more elaborate than the previous one rather than reading the selected<br />book. Trouble in paradise surfaces when two men apply for membership to<br />the group. And though the men add an interesting touch to the club,<br />they bring to the surface some of the group's reservations. But<br />pretensions and reservations are pushed to the background as the ladies<br />face some monumental hurdles and realize there is more to the BELLES<br />than extravagant meetings.<br />CLUB TWO: Everybody's Book Club - New York, NY<br />The members of the club are from different ethnic backgrounds, African<br />American, Japanese, Hispanic, Jewish and Italian. So this group shares<br />a lot of culture, a lot of clashes and a lot of learning about stereotyping.<br />The club members work on the 100th floor of the World Trade Center, North<br />Tower building. On September 11, 2001 the book club's manager left her<br />office to run an errand, and that is the last coherent thought she has<br />until many hours later. Now all she can envision is the collapsed building<br />and the fate of the other club members. As she anxiously waits for positive<br />news, she realizes that though the group shared many heated debates, they<br />also shared a lot of love.<br />CLUB THREE: Women of the Knights Reading Group - Washington, D.C.<br />Here is a group of 14 ladies who attended the same high school, took<br />different roads in life, yet managed to keep in touch. Most were friends<br />long before they came together to form a reading group. The friendships<br />are good and the reading is fun until one of the members learns that her<br />husband dated one of her club members prior to their marriage. There is a<br />touch of humor as the `wondering' wife is brought to her knees when she<br />loses focus and goes a bit too far trying to determine if her husband is<br />still faithful.<br />CLUB FOUR: Bay Area On-Line Book Readers - Oakland, CA<br />A book signing by J. California Cooper was the perfect opportunity for<br />several of the on-line members to meet. One member in particular came<br />with the express purpose of putting names with faces. Immediately he is<br />able to select members based on the conversations and descriptions they<br />have exchanged. He senses that the on-line camaraderie is threatened<br />because some of the members have taken their evaluations of each other<br />too far. But what they all learn is that things are not always how you<br />imagine them, and that the internet does not compare to the the warmth<br />of putting names with bodies.<br />CLUB FIVE: Ballers, Shot-Callers and Book Worms - Houston, TX<br />Interesting name, as well it should be because this is an all male book<br />club whose members play some serious b-ball, who are up and coming<br />entrepreneurs and who love to read. The birth of their book club is as<br />interesting as the name. This story is told by Cheri who notices the men<br />while working out at the gym. The camaraderie between them sparks Cheri's<br />curiosity and after eavesdropping on their conversations she is so<br />intrigued, she offers her home for their book club meeting when one of<br />the members could not host it. What she learns from conversing with the<br />men and from hanging with them in just one book club meeting is enough to<br />change her views on men, book clubs and her life.<br />Curtis Bunn has written five luminous stories that invite readers to share<br />book club moments.

For Love of Money	Nina Foxx's sophomore novel, GET SOME LOVE, tells the story of southern girl Angelica Chapee.  Shattered and caught off guard by the death of her beloved grandfather, Angelica is even more surprised to find out what he stipulated in his will. It appears Angelica's grandfather has left her quite a bit of money; however, she will have to meet his unconventional conditions before she can reap the benefits.<br />Meanwhile, the Bronx native Juan Delgado is in town for a huge contract with a gospel convention for his family business, Delgado Cleaners. Juan is reluctant to take over the family business; he'd rather be a saxophonist.  His best friend James, who accompanied him to Baton Rouge for the convention, seems a more likely candidate to run the dry cleaning plants after Juan's father retires.  Juan and Angelica meet by happenstance.<br />GET SOME LOVE is a novel of self-love and common sense.  Intertwined with the circumstances that Angelica and Juan are dealing with is an intense and suspenseful sub-plot.  The main characters were lucid and approachable in a way a good friend might be.  I felt myself wanting to give them both advice on how to handle their situations.

To God be the glory.	(Mocha love - a love of a superior quality-strong, rich in flavor and infused wih passion that could only come from a masculine Chocolate-flavored Black man who has his act together.)<br />This explicit definition sat me up for a steamy novel, and in a sense that's what this is. But the steam that rises in powerful bursts is from the deep 'inner-most' thoughts of men who have come full circle with who they are. James Guitard, has taken familiar topics: Love, Passion, Deceit, Honesty and Power, and has written inspirational stories from the soul of men who are not afraid to show penitence and reverence to God. Men who are not afraid to expound on the significant decisions made, concerning the sanctity of marriage, the power of forgiveness, the rewards gained from abstinence and the dislocation of self worth because of infidelity and promiscuity.<br />MOCHA LOVE is saturated with rich emotions that stimulate and inspire. The ultimate message from these stirring words is that resolute faith will keep people in step with God's plan. This is an innovative, convicting and magnetic book. This is one to read; it will relate to your aesthetic senses.<br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14

It was not until September eleventh, after the world<br />shifted on its axis, that she became more aware, more focused, and then<br />the writing began.<br />Rebecca Barnett has captured a guide to evaluate leadership techniques<br />without using meaningless buzzwords. She uses this tool to scrutinize<br />a person's moral core which should help strengthen their conviction when<br />facing everyday decisions about life. She reminds people of the their<br />role in building proud organizational cultures.<br />WINNING WITHOUT LOSING YOUR WAY, is captured in eight chapters, each<br />highlighting the heart and soul of Character-Centered Leadership.<br />The book has personal and personable stories from the many people she<br />interviewed.

And what 'life-skill' encouragement would<br />we give our children and others looking for advice.  She shares her<br />insight about what really is important at the end of the day.

Vanessa Grant went from an abusive home into marriage with Carl Lewis, a childhood friend whom she falls deeply in love with.  Their twenty year marriage is divided into three stages:  the honeymoon years, the golden years and then the years of abandonment and betrayal. Over the course of their marriage, Carl is shown to be unfaithful and a less than average provider for the family. Vanessa, however, builds a relationship with God and uses His help and prophetic messages to steer her through the up and downs of being married to Carl.<br />During the last seven years of the marriage, Vanessa becomes the main provider of the family with God at the helm and Carl basically taking the back seat or absenting himself completely much of the time.  After much prayer and soul-searching, Vanessa finally realizes that she is not happy and her survival is dependent upon unleashing the chains of mental and emotional scars that have kept her down for so long.  God reveals that she has internalized so much of the hurt and pain over the years that she cannot move on until she forgives Carl.  It is this forgiveness and GOD allowing her to experience love on another level that &quot;uncages&quot; her.  In her awakening, Vanessa learns to love herself for the first time in her life.<br />UNCAGED is actually based on the true story of the life of Deeva Denez.

My Room Awaits Me	COLORED WAITING ROOM by Patricia G. Pope is the story of the deep, dark descent of Alberta Graham.  Alberta is a security officer at a Federal nuclear plant in rural Cherokee, Tennessee.  Because of a promotion, she is transferred to this rural and racist area of Tennessee.  Alberta has two strikes against her, one she is black and two she is female.<br />The story depicts the corruption, for monetary gain, by the employees at the nuclear plant, Albertas discovery of it, the cover up that ensues and the racist attitudes of the employees.  In addition to the corruption, Albertas mental state into abyss is showcased.  We read and watch as this woman attempts to fight the system within and lose her mind in the interim.  Additionally, we are able to experience with Alberta a romantic encounter that she has against her better judgment.  How does this encounter fit into the scheme of things at the nuclear plant?  Who are these people, both black and white, that enter and disturb Albertas world?  Why is Alberta marked as a revolutionary and troublemaker within the good ole boy network?<br />It is quite evident, as Pope states in the synopsis, that this book is for both the casual reader and the scholar.  The colored waiting room, on the grounds of the nuclear plant, is symbolic and through Albertas actions and her musings this room becomes her refuge.  The use of several literary techniques is excellent providing for a thoughtful, sympathetic, yet disturbing read.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
The "Brodello"	SEXUAL HEALING is a bawdy adventure, featuring two enterprising friends who concoct a zany scheme to provide a full service spa environment, in which African American women can acquire some sexual healing.<br />Centerstage of this melodrama are Acey and Lydia, two lifelong friends who find themselves at a juncture of their lives where good sex is at a premium and satisfying sex almost nonexistent. While lamenting their sexual frustrations, the two forty-something women start brainstorming on what would constitute the perfect sexual scenario.  They concur that one of the main ingredients would be spine tingling sex on demand, with no strings attached...and so the idea is born of establishing a \\"brodello\\", an exclusive spa, designed specifically for African American women.  This spa would provide all the services of a full-service salon, with the added bonus of satisfying sex.<br />The outrageous sequence of events that unfold as the two entrepreneurs go about planning  and implementing their ideas, make for an uproariously funny, light hearted romp, which leaves the reader wondering what's next. While SEXUAL HEALING makes light fare of a heavy topic, it's also an irreverent challenge to it's audience, to examine their own sexual ideology.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
Looking for a God-sent man	In THE BEARER OF THE SIGN, A CONTINUATION OF UNCAGED, Deeva Denez continues with her story.  Having unleashed the woman from within and divorced her husband of twenty years, Vanessa Lewis is now in the transition phase of her life.  She has prayed for and is looking for a sign from God to identify the man that will be the right one for her.  Before she receives the sign, Vanessa deals with a host of men trying to be the one.<br />Who will it be, an ex-husband who desperately wants his \\"good thing\\" back, a married man who refuses to let go, or a man of God with issues who is also looking for a mate?  Will she allow God to decide or will her alter ego, Viva, take over?  As Vanessa shuffles these men, tries to control Viva, and continues to look for the sign, she deals with several issues related to women trying to live a Godly life while being single.<br />In this second part of the Uncaged Trilogy, Denez allows us to experience her search for a mate.  Using Vanessa's voice once again in THE BEARER OF THE SIGN, Denez gives a compelling look at the pitfalls of dating and dealing with sins of the flesh despite your relationship with God.  In a writing style that is simply unique, we learn that having God in your life doesn't guarantee that only good things will happen.  You must constantly show your faith by putting God first in all things and be willing to submit to His will.  This was a good read and I am anxiously waiting for the final part of this trilogy.<br />Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-14
I Wish I May, I Wish I Might	At first glance ANOTHER MAN by Ronda Rountree is your typical love triangle novel. At second glance, this novel has somewhat more to offer.<br />Adrienne and James live together and have been together for the last ten years; now they are getting married. Adrienne and James are as opposite as you can get, but somehow their love has survived. Adrienne is a go-getter while James prefers the status quo. This irritates Adrienne to no end, but she plans to marry James just the same. One day Adrienne bumps into handsome Daniel and all bets are off, or are they? The novel is not as simple as that and it provides some serious soul searching on the part of Adrienne and control on the part of Daniel unbeknownst to a clueless James.<br />Rountree provides a very endearing and humorous character in Adrienne's best friend Charlene. Charlene is her conscience. Rountree provides a small and interesting storyline about Charlene and her mother's relationship that she only touched upon that very well could be developed into its own story.  With the exception of the editing, which needs much improvement, ANOTHER MAN is a good book with an unpredictable ending that can provide a lively discussion among book clubs.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Also the mother of Regina's lost love of a lifetime, Beth is a motivational speaker for single mothers who strives to inspire and lift them up.  However, while her orations are uplifting, Beth's personal relationships leave much to be desired.<br />Guided by her Aunt Abbie's post-menopausal extrasensory visions, Regina heads from DC to Atlanta to pay both tribute to Beth's son and payments to her banker.  In Atlanta she meets Blue Hamilton, a black man with eyes the color of the sea. He owns the building where she decides to board, and as she learns, she has known him before in a less traditional sense. Once Regina gets to work she finds that her aunt's visions are much more than the ramblings of an old woman and that her task is much larger than saving the house where she was raised.<br />Pearl Cleage is one of those great storytellers that knows how to work virtually any situation. I was enraptured with this book, and each page added a litany of emotions to my soul.  The primary characters are spectacular, but the other characters she included are just as real, and they each add an important piece to the story. I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-10
Breaking Barriers	Alex Baxter is no stranger to tragedy. While he was still a very young child his mother, a civil rights activist, was killed in the South under suspicious circumstances. Devastated by his wife's death, Alex's father focuses all his affection on his athletic older son, Ivan, and has little to do with &quot;book wormish&quot; Alex, who presumably reminds him of his deceased wife.<br />Alex's existence as an inner city youth exposes him to many shocking incidences of violent crime, but none more disturbing than the night he witnesses the brutal drive-by shooting of his brother, an aspiring basketball star. His brother was the only bright spot in his life and after his death, Alex finds himself alone with an emotionally decimated father who completely withdraws from life. Alex realizes that education is his only way out of his torturous environment, so he applies himself in school and graduates as class valedictorian with a full scholarship to a prestigious black college.<br />College life finds an ambitious Alex applying himself rigorously in hopes of changing his fortune. When he unwittingly intervenes during an attack on the mayor's daughter, he somehow emerges as a hero and suddenly finds himself a campus celebrity. The mayor expresses his gratitude by taking up Alex's cause and starts backing him financially and Alex finds his long awaited avenue into the world of the privileged. But the mayor is leading a double life, which plunges an unsuspecting Alex into a nightmarish world of danger and deception.<br />Collen Dixon's new novel is a disturbing commentary on the social infrastructure of the urban ghetto and gives insight into what motivates some inner-city youth to rise above their circumstance and break down the socioeconomic barriers imposed on them by an unforgiving society. SIMON SAYS tends to be a bit predictable in spots, but nonetheless is an intriguing, well written whodunit which will keep the reader interested from its very somber beginning to its extremely bizarre ending.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersremely bizarre ending.<br />Reviewed by Autumn<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-09-09
Gripping, Compelling, Real	John King's life can be compared to anything except royalty. Born<br />under tragic circumstances, he literally punched his way into the<br />world. The midwife who delivered him believed he was a demon child<br />and nearly succumbed to voices telling her to kill him as he was<br />being born. Raised by a grandmother who detested the sight of him,<br />John is forced to flee Bueller, Texas when he is fifteen years old<br />with too many unanswered questions of how he came to be. Life for<br />him is one city after another, too many temporary liaisons and an<br />emptiness that threatens to consume him.<br />Connie Rogers and her sister were deserted by their mother when<br />they were twelve and eight years old. Her sister was adopted and<br />Connie was placed in the foster care program. At the age of fourteen<br />she flees the foster home and lives on the streets of Denver<br />surviving by any means necessary. Her reality is that she exists<br />because someone needs a doormat on which to walk. Numerous one night<br />encounters have brought more heartache than a young girl should have.<br />When the faces of all the men she has known merge into one face that<br />haunts her, she seeks a way to save herself.<br />King's travels places him in Denver at a time when he is tired of<br />running from his demons and his past. John's and Connie's meeting is<br />not monumental because, while both know how to survive, neither<br />knows how to live. As a reader I hoped the hard times they'd endured<br />did not make them believe heartache is all life had to offer them.<br />ONE DAY I SAW A BLACK KING is Connie's testament to a wayward John<br />King who stirs unfamiliar feelings in her. The story is haunting and<br />sometimes joyless as it pulls you into the lives of the characters.<br />All of the pieces are in place for this one, the storyline is<br />exceptional, the characters are real, and the pace is on target.<br />Though the secondary characters have their own story to tell, Ms.<br />Mason expertly uses them to enhance the flow of this story. Much more<br />than a story about survival; this is a story about standing toe-to-toe<br />with life and learning how to live it.

Twenty eight down, twenty four to go.	What would make a smart, attractive, charismatic investment<br />banker commit to going out on a date every Friday night for<br />a full year? Predictable situations often invoke unpredictable<br />behavior.  Facing her thirtieth birthday, and suffering from a<br />broken heart, Ritta is depressed. After a session with her<br />therapist who prescribes medication for her depression, she<br />decides to re-write her script. So she embarks on a 52 week<br />dating sabbatical. This book shares the good, the bad and the<br />ugly side of dating through the eyes of a woman who desperately<br />needs a man to complete her life.<br />In EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT: MY YEAR OF DATING MISADVENTURES, Ms.<br />McLaughlin tells her story with open-hearted honesty, bravely<br />sharing her flaws and her reckless actions while she dates 28<br />different men. Her account of these outings exposes how<br />deceitful, insincere and dogmatic some men are. Three best<br />friends serve as the life preserver that saves her from<br />drowning in an emotional cesspool after each failed encounter.<br />Though this is an interesting read, at times it is repetitive<br />and predictable. But, to the author's credit, the escapades<br />are sometimes hilarious and sometimes dismal as they depict<br />realistic scenarios of people looking for love in too many<br />places.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-27
Things Are Not Always As They Seem	Morgana is a small business owner, she is married to a prominent D.C. attorney,  and is the proud mother of two rather successful young adult children.  So it would seem that at this point in her life all is well, however, appearances can be deceiving.  Behind the façade of a happy couple, she and her husband really seem like roommates sharing the same space instead of a couple sharing a life.  Then life as Morgana knows it is shaken to the very core when she discovers her husband is having an affair just minutes after receiving news that her mother has died.  She heads to Salvation, Georgia to make funeral arrangements for her mother and get away from her husband.  But while in Salvation Morgana finds herself on a journey of self discovery during which she uncovers unspoken family secrets through her mother's diaries.  During this journey she learns more about her family, and most importantly herself.<br />Rochelle Alers has crafted a richly conceived tale about the impact that secrets can have on a family and the sacrifices that people make in the name of love.  As the story unfolded I found that I couldn't put this book down.  Although this book is a mainstream fiction read, there is a hint of romance intermingled in the plot that will satisfy Alers' diehard romance fans.  This is a complex story about love, hate, betrayal, and sacrifice that is sure to leave readers satisfied.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-27
Appearances are deceiving	Unconditional love, unwavering friendship, self-respect, and reaping what you sow are only a few of the moral lessons swirling around in Mary B. Morrison's HE'S JUST A FRIEND. As Morrison intertwines a myriad of lessons in this swiftly flowing novel, her colorful characters and lively plots entertain and amaze us. Fancy is our main character; however, various other morals sagaciously appear via Fancy's best friends Savoy and Tanya.<br />From the outside looking in, one sees Fancy Taylor's prowess, arrogance, tenacious weave, expensive attire adorning a tawdry size 7, an opulent apartment, and luxurious transportation. The various male 'friends' in her life each serve a specific purpose-- money. HE'S JUST A FRIEND is a didactic novel that chronicles the extravagant lifestyle of a money chaser. Morrison successfully shows that appearances are deceiving and that everything has a price. Nothing is without toil no matter how easy it appears to the onlookers. As we dissect Fancy's veneer and chip away her armor, what we find beneath elicits both disgust and pity. As Fancy experiences 'what goes around comes around', she realizes that what she's so often overlooked and taken for granted is indeed her biggest blessing. But once you soil and walk on a rug for so long, not even the washing machine can rejuvenate it to its original tenacity.<br />In HE'S JUST A FRIEND you get an action packed story that also makes you ponder. First the characters capture your attention then the lively story ushers you through the novel. Got a minute? That's all you'll need for HE'S JUST A FRIEND because once you get going with it, you'll keep going until it's complete.<br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-27

Almost famous	One of Maryann Reid's characters from Sex and the Single Sister is making a repeat performance in her latest novel, USE ME OR LOSE ME. New York news anchor Farah Washington wants to move up in the world in terms of her career.  Although she's a popular network personality, she's still not where she wants to be: at the helm of the nationwide morning talk show Rise and Shine.  But the new sistah in charge at the station, Ms. Joyce Meyers, has no such plans for the young broadcaster.  This perplexes Farah because she expects for the only other African American female at the station to have her back.<br />Like her career, Farah's love life has come to crossroads.  She is envious of the life her best girlfriend Lola leads with her baby girl and husband Chris.  During the bustle at her job, Farah remains focused on the latest stories and the industry buzz, but at her apartment the silence is deafening, the bed is cold, and her biological clock ticking away.<br />Farah meets debonair attorney Lenox Whitworth during her contract negotiations with the network.  He's a high class, well-bred brother who makes his own way and gives back to the community.  They begin to form a relationship filled with high society shindigs, lavish trips, and wining and dining.  Both Lenox and Farah are after something, whether it is arm candy or career advancement.  As Lenox says, \\"If you can't be used, you're useless.\\"  Their tumultuous existence together is the driving force behind USE ME OR LOSE ME.<br />Reid tells Farah and Lenox's story in a way that keeps you interested and intrigued.  I was incessantly trying to envision the next road she was going to take me down. The plot is not anything groundbreaking, nor are the characters eccentric or raw; but it works.

Seasons of Life	T.D. Jakes bursts on to the Christian Fiction scene, with his first novel, COVER GIRLS.  In this book he likens the life of a woman to the four seasons.  Spring being the time of youthful growth and nurturing, summer being the time emerging from the period nurturing and coming into full bloom as a young adult, fall being the period of harvest and rest, and finally winter, which is a time of waiting for new life to emerge.  Each of the four main characters in the book represent one of the seasons in his analogy.  Michelle is young, spirited and in the summer of her life, yet she is battered by a troubling past that continues to haunt her.  Tonya is in the Fall of her life, but instead of enjoying this time she is always trying to please others while neglecting herself.  Mrs. Judson, the only primary character that is not African American, is in the winter of her life.  But instead of being at peace and waiting for new life to emerge, she is caught in a web of sorrow primarily due to her insatiable desire to appear \\"together.\\"  Miz Ida is also in the winter of her life, but as a result of her strong faith in God, she celebrates this stage of her life and looks forward to the many things that are yet to come.  The characters lives intersect and in spite of their unlikely relationships with one another, each of them grow to new heights spiritually and personally.<br />T.D. Jakes is known by many for his prolific non-fiction writings on any number of Christian topics.  With COVER GIRLS, his first novel, Jakes continues to establish himself as a writer whom everyone should take note of.  He seamlessly integrates Biblical principles into real life situations that women can relate to, while keeping the reader engrossed in the lives of the characters.  As a result, the novel is Christian Fiction at its best, filled with real life situations and everyday struggles.  All of the characters are well-rounded, and they are made up of both the strengths and the flaws that make them inherently human.  In this novel he demonstrates that all women, black or white, rich or poor, hip or reserved, share a common bond and common struggle with faith.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersem inherently human.

The brokenhearted can survive, dream, and move on	In an emotional, heart-pulling introduction and first chapter, we are given an in-depth look into the real world of E. Lynn Harris, not the glamorized life many of his fans will assume that he's led.  WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKENHEARTED is the highly acclaimed and much anticipated release of the summer.  It's a tell-all on the life of an award-winning author who started out self-publishing and has continuously reached new heights writing about relationships between gay and bi-sexual men.  We are now able to find out more about the young child and man prior to what we hear about today and have read in the bios that accompany his books.<br />Opening with his suicide attempt in 1990, Harris immediately shows us that his life is very different from the wealthy characters he writes about. He tells of how even at a time in which he was ready to give up living, he was able to come back from \\"rock-bottom\\" through his faith in God as well as the support of friends and family.  Without delay, he grabs the reader's attention and then takes you back in time as he shares about his childhood and growing up in Little Rock, Arkansas.<br />The first experience he shares is Easter 1964.  He is dressed up in his new jacket and is excited about giving his Easter speech before the church congregation.  His happiness is quickly shattered when his father Ben rips apart his new jacket, verbally demeans him and calls him a sissy.  He doesn't quite understand that while his two sisters can proudly twirl around and display their Easter outfits, it's not befitting for a young boy to do the same.  This just one of the scenes he shares about life at the hands of his physically abusive father.  He spends much of his childhood in fear of Ben, wondering how a father can be so cruel to his own son; while at the same time sensing that he's different.  This sets the stage for a low self-esteem and the need to begin pretending to be something he isn't.<br />WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKENHEARTED takes us from the time Harris is a child through his young adult life.  He shares his fears, his desire to be in a loving relationship, and his realization that he does prefer men to women; despite his attempts otherwise.  Through his candid and honest recount of those times in his life, we learn of his fight with depression, the abusive relationships he's had the misfortune to suffer through and the make-believe world he built around himself to hide not only his poor upbringing, but also his sexual preference.<br />His job after college working with IBM and the success he attained in a position that not many other black men held showed his tenacity and perseverance to reach the dreams of success that he put in place as a child back in Arkansas.  In spite of this, Harris was often left with a broken heart falling into depression, alcoholism, and the continued closet-lifestyle of a gay man unable to admit it.<br />It saddened me reading that one of my favorite authors had suffered so much heartache, but it brought me joy to read of the lessons he's passing on to others.  In his memoir, we're able to see him in a more human light; no longer comparing him to his characters.  The lessons he shares should do well in showing others the importance of appreciating yourself, being strong in your faith, valuing friendships, being secure in who you are as a person-even if it is different from the role in which society tries to place you, and knowing that your life is yours to live without pretense or being ashamed of your past.  I'll sum it up by saying...the brokenhearted can survive, dream, and move on to claim not only success, but happiness.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A heavy read	BLACK FUTURISTS IN THE INFORMATION AGE is a must read for anybody interested in communications technology. The authors give a lot of information on all the latest technological advances. Probably more than you ever want to know but all the things that you need to know. It discusses how African Americans need to get ahead of the curve and expand their information to the African Diaspora. While there are many disadvantages that African Americans must necessarily face in this country such as the assault on affirmative action, a disinterested market in terms of targeting African Americans, unemployment, redlining in housing and loans, poor schooling opportunities, there are many up-beat reasons to continue pushing forward to make sure that we are not left behind. Concrete ideas for technology savvy are given which is a major plus. Also included is an overview of the change in FCC rules and deregulations.<br />For the technologically uninvolved it is a tough book but one that helps explain the new world in a reasonable, understandable format.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />of the RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-12
Herstory	In Dead Above Ground, Jervey Tervalon introduced us to Lita Du Champ, and his latest novel, LITA, is a continuance of her story.  After Lita and her husband Winston move from New Orleans with their two children and her twin sisters Ava and Ana, they reside in Los Angeles.  Ava and Ana are a handful at seventeen, especially Ava. She has blossomed into a young woman, complete with the Coke bottle shape and know-it-all attitude.  Lita tries to be patient with her and the rest of the family, but she finds herself becoming more and more like her deceased mother everyday, and less and less satisfied with her circumstances.  She isn't infinitely happy with her situation in Los Angeles, but the alternative - going back to Louisiana, her abusive father, and the house where her mother burned to death - seems much less attractive to her.<br />LITA is a novel of supernatural and natural powers, revealing both ghosts of the past and forces of nature in the present. It's a book that holds on to you from the first page, and there certainly are no lulls.  Like the other Tervalon novels I have read, I enjoyed the story immensely and implore him to continue the Du Champ legacy.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-12
Living a Life of Crime	THE BIRTH OF A CRIMINAL is a reflection of Asante Kahari's life growing up in poverty.  The book is \\"supposedly\\" based on events that occurred within the author's life, yet Kahari often changes names, details, and calls the work \\"fiction\\" as not to implicate himself or others in crimes.  The book follows no distinct pattern or form; it often repetitive and jumps around, which leave the reader confused.  At times the book reads like a journal, other times a novel, and it seems to be more of a vent than an actual literary work.  Kahari professes that he is not a writer, and the quality of the book leans toward what he has said.  The author writes the book with no clear sense of who the audience is.  In the beginning of the book, he claims the book is a \\"work to be studied to inform white America of the problems facing her if they don't do something about the problems of urban America.\\"  Later he states that the book is written for young, blacks that may take a moral lesson away from his story.  Yet he never points out a compelling argument or reasoning to keep young readers from taking take to streets.  If anything, he glorifies his tales of the streets and his stints in prison.  He shows little or no remorse for the crimes he has committed, and gives the impression that writing this novel is a legitimate \\"hustle\\" for him.<br />Despite its flaws, the book does have redeeming characteristics.  Kahari's story is one that is filled with action and drama, which makes the book an interesting read.  With proper editing, a better organization of the events, and a knowledge of who his audience is, THE BIRTH OF A CRIMINAL would have unlimited potential, and perhaps be a must read.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-12
Vivid, Descriptive, but a bit unrealistic	Vividly describing Kaya, an island off the Western Coast of Africa, debut author Dorothy A. Atabong launches us into the novel THE PRINCESS OF KAYA.  The book is a romance, yet at times it is also a painful drama that will remind you of a new age Romeo and Juliet. The most obvious difference is that this story is told in the present time with an African family of royalty.  Atabong weaves in a cast of numerous characters to present a story of love, betrayal, and the consequences that one act can have not only on those involved but on an entire country.  She illustrates the importance of traditions and what happens when they are broken and/or sacrificed in lieu of love or other feelings of desire.<br />Princess Kaya, the heiress to the Kayan throne, is returning home after being away at college in England when her entourage is attacked enroute to the palace.  In the midst of the attack, she is pulled to safety by Aadil, an unknown mysterious man who not only saves her life but also escorts her safely to the gates of the palace.  Even though he is aware that he has saved the Princess, Aadil refuses to meet the King of Kaya so that he can be properly thanked for his part in her well-being.  Though Kaya is not sure why he saved her life, where he had come from, or anything about his identity, thoughts of him remain with her after he has left and then later when they meet up again.  The thoughts are still there when she's to be married to another man.<br />Atabong has given us a beautiful tropical setting in which she does a wonderful job of introducing us to the traditions and history of West Africa.  We also see the importance of traditions and the proceedings of those of royalty.  In spite of this, the numerous characters and typographical errors distracted me from the story and took away some of the appeal.  Additionally, I do believe in true love, but I wasn't too taken with what I perceived as the cast of male characters being obsessed over one woman.  The first man or two seemed realistic, but after reading about four different men close to Kaya confessing their love to her, it was a little implausible and over the top to me.  The ending also left me wondering if the author had indeed wrapped the story up or quickly closed it in an effort to end the story.  In spite of this, Atabong's description of West Africa along with the dialogue put me in mind of an actual movie.  I'd love to see this as a full-length movie or film.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Healing for fathers or for the family as a whole?	In BLACK FATHERS: A CALL FOR HEALING the author emphasizes the importance of the fathers' presence in African American homes, the necessity for the present father to not only have belief and faith in God, but to also pass that faith along to the family, and the necessity for black fathers to develop healthy relationships, independent of the mother, with their kids.  The author uses her own relationship with her father to bring home the importance of fathers in the household. She admonishes the absentee father and relays to him how important he is to his family and children. The author expresses that the absence of black fathers strongly contributes to the demise of the black family.<br />Specifically, the book is about the black family...past, present, and future. The author speculates on the black family's demise, offering opinions on why and how, but pointing to absentee fathers in general as the catapult. What I didn't like about the book was the glaring absence of placid statistics to validate the point of view. I often wondered who the intended audience was. I initially assumed the audience to be absentee fathers, but soon abandoned that thought because the tone was very accusatory, which would alienate the absentee father audience. This is a noteworthy and touching subject in the African American community. BLACK FATHERS: A CALL FOR HEALING is an admirable contribution to the African American plight to reconstruct black families and reunite fathers with their children.<br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love (MissLove)<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-12
Short, short stories	In reading short stories, I have to prepare myself because I often find that they leave me wanting to know more about the characters and the brief look we get inside their lives.  THE CURSE OF THE SPEAR AND OTHER STORIES by Eugen M. Bacon is yet another book I'll add to my list of stories I wish had been longer.  Bacon has broken this book into two parts, one with a theme of inner strength and the mystical, while the other part focuses on relationships.<br /><br />Though fast-paced and easy to grasp, I simply didn't like how abruptly most of the stories ended, but I would encourage those who enjoy short stories to pick this one up.  I enjoyed most of the stories, despite them being told in mostly narrative form and being so short. Additionally, Bacon does offer twists at the end of quite a few of them that caught me off guard and made the reading more pleasurable. One of the stories I really enjoyed was &quot;Sonny, The Decibel Dumper&quot; which tells the story of a family and their newborn son and all the things that go along with being new parents.  I found it endearing and a good way to close this collection of short stories.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-12
EXCITING, ACTION-PACKED, VISUALLY DESCRIPTIVE MYSTERY	Fans of Glenville Lovell and/or mysteries are in for a treat with his latest book, TOO BEAUTIFUL TO DIE.  True to the form of most whodunit novels, movies, and other pieces showcasing the life of a private detective, Lovell definitely delivers!  TOO BEAUTIFUL TO DIE is an exciting, action-packed, visually descriptive, fast-moving, and witty tale that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Formerly a New York City policeman, Blades Overstreet is at odds with the NYPD, awaiting a settlement from the city, and in a battle with himself over his separation from his wife.  Blades finds himself caught up in issues surrounding his wife, his family; specifically his anger over being shot and wounded by a white police officer during an undercover operation gone bad.  Convinced that the system is out to get him when the other cop is cleared of all wrongdoings and the shooting is determined an accident, Blades resigns from the Force and loses himself in bitterness and is set on revenge.  As a result, his wife leaves him and in the midst of trying to get her back, he hears from Jimmie, the white cab driver that saved his life after the shooting.  Blades feels indebted to Jimmie because he rescued Blades from the street after he had been shot and took him to the hospital, thus saving his life and becoming a friend.<br /><br />At the request of Precious, a famous soap opera actress, Jimmie has summoned Blades to help Precious find her father.  Uninterested in the position, Blades disregards his gut feelings on the case and accepts it after pressure from Jimmie.  He accompanies Precious to meet an informant who supposedly has information about her father.  She's never known her father, doesn't know who he is or what he looks like, and it seems odd that out of the blue someone has called her claiming to have information.  What happens when the informant is found dead...and is later revealed to be an FBI agent?  The NYPD come looking for Blades as a suspect.  More drama unfolds as Blades becomes involved with Precious and continues on his quest to find her father. On the run for his life, he must find out who is setting him up while at the same time trying to stay clear of the authorities.<br /><br />TOO BEAUTIFUL TO DIE is mystery writing at its best, and Lovell not only commands your attention as the story unravels, but he also tells it in a literary tone that strokes the imagination and emotions of the reader.  I was thoroughly surprised that I loved this book so much because it's told in a very strong narrative format, which I normally don't care for in books.  Lovell not only pulls it off, he does it well! The ending is absolutely breath taking and it left me applauding Lovell and setting out on a mission to pick up his earlier works.  Though Lovell did an excellent job of visually displaying the happenings in the book, I'd love to see it on the big screen.  Additionally, I look forward to the continuation of the Blades Overstreet character and further mysteries by Lovell.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

The Return of Fearless	Paris Minton is a bookstore owner, which is an excellant profession for him because he would rather read a book than deal with people. The only person that is really capable of pulling Paris out of his shell is his closest friend Fearless Jones. Early one morning Fearless shows up on Paris' doorstep with a tale of woe. He has met a woman who is in search of her missing husband and the father of her son. Because he feels sorry for the mother and child Fearless begs Paris to work on the case with him. While they are not private detectives or policeman, they are adept at locating people. Paris' instincts tell him to kick Fearless out of his apartment but because Fearless is like a brother Paris reluctantly agrees to help.

Paris and Fearless are two very different people whose adventures keep things interesting. Paris is the quiet and introverted type and Fearless is trouble with a heart of gold and together these two make a perfect combination.

A Business Guide for Minorities	Sharon T. Freeman's IMPORTING, EXPORTING, AND E-COMMERCE is an excellent resource for minority businesses.  Broken down into everyday language, the book is a how-to guide for expanding a business into the global market.  The book is comprehensive, and provides excellent explanations and analyses of the business world in an easy to understand format.  I am not a business-oriented individual, but I learned a great deal and was never confused by the business or technological jargon. I found the chapters on electronic commerce to be most interesting, because like many other consumers, I frequently rely on the Internet for purchasing goods.<br />Although specifically geared towards a \\"minority, immigrant, and women\\" audience, IMPORTING, EXPORTING, AND E-COMMERCE is a valuable reference for businesses and consumers alike. This book is sure to prepare any business owner for success in the global market.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-12

Easy faces a cast of original characters and some new shady and interesting ones, all of whom keep him on his toes.<br />SIX EASY PIECES: EASY RAWLINS STORIES, Mosley's latest book, treats readers to seven different Rawlins' adventures, with Easy as the common thread.

Truths to Live By	We have all heard proverbs at some point in our lives; little truths that teach morals, tell stories, or teach us how to live.  In PROVERBS FOR THE PEOPLE, authors take insightful African, African American, and Biblical proverbs and utilize them to create extraordinary short stories that depict truths and leave marks on the heart.<br />This unique anthology contains stories from well known authors such as Travis Hunter, Omar Tyree, Margaret Johnson-Hodge, Pearl Cleage, and others, as well as stories from up and coming authors.  Like the proverbs they represent, the stories are diverse and full of emotions.  Although all of the stories were wonderful and touching, some of personal favorites were Gwynne Forster's \\"First Thing Monday Morning,\\" which taught the morals that actions speak louder than words and to be careful what you wish for, because you just may get it, and Robert Fleming's \\"A Crisis of Faith,\\" about a man who is wrongly incarcerated.<br />PROVERBS FOR THE PEOPLE is a wonderful novel that will teach, inspire, and entertain.  It has a story that everyone can relate to, and will make a wonderful addition to any book collection.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-09
Looking for love in all the wrong places	In Debra Phillips' latest, California resident Queenie is a plus-sized diva working as a buyer for a major department store. In her mind's eye, her size has never been something she was ashamed of; rather, it was something she embraced and flaunted. Her co-worker and peer, Raymo, embraces Queenie and her voluptuous frame as well, bringing her homemade food and flowers on a regular basis. But Queenie can't be bothered with Raymo; he reminds her too much of her past.<br />Queenie's eccentric best friend, Poetta, talks her into attending a benefit auction and the wares up for bid are dates with celebrity look-alikes. Queenie is bored and antsy until Zeke, a Denzel dead-ringer, is placed up for bid. Queenie sets out on a mission to win not only the bid for a date with Zeke, but also his long term affections.<br />THE HIGH PRICE OF A GOOD MAN is a convivial read, abounding with Queenie's and Poetta's antics.  As Queenie narrates much of the tale, we become deeply aquainted with both her voice and her personality. There were a few moments where I said &quot;Ohmygawd&quot; out loud, to quote Queenie and express my amazement at the shenanigans in which she partook to find out just how high THE HIGH PRICE OF A GOOD MAN was. I openly encourage those looking for a jovially moral-based story to pick up this book.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-09
Starting Over	Imagine the devastation you feel from losing your job. With unemployment upon you, there are so many questions floating around inside your head; how will you pay your bills and how will you eat? The whole experience becomes overwhelming as you struggle to remain positive. In trying to start over, one must start from ground zero, which is basically a person's lowest point. And it takes a strong individual to overcome the obstacles that are thrown in their way and rise to the top.<br />Author Seni Hazzan is all about helping others overcome financial issues and unhappiness with job situations. His book, REBUILDING FROM GROUND ZERO: AN EMPOWERING GUIDE TO BUILDING AND SECURING WEALTH, gives readers step by step advice on how they can gain financial stability and independence. It is also a good source for small business owners as it documents in detail mistakes the author overcame to become a successful entrepreneur.<br />This is an inspiring book because Mr. Hazzan uses his knowledge to help others who are starting a business or those who are looking to improve themselves financially. I recommend this book.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />THE RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-09
Culture Clash	Shawn James' debut novel follows the main character, Isis, the illegitimate daughter of the great Egyptian god, Osiris.  The story begins with Isis being condemned to an \\"island of solitude\\" to make amends for committing a heinous crime.  Her time alone is to be spent reflecting on her crime and letting go of an intense hatred that is threatening to destroy her.<br />Osiris wants to help his daughter, but does not know how to approach her because he was never there for her as a father.  His wife, also named Isis, accepts her stepdaughter and tries to facilitate a union between the two.  Unbeknownst to them, Isis' evil uncle Seth and his lackey, Esteem are seeking to extract revenge on Osiris, and will use ISIS as their weapon.<br />As the story progresses, we learn more about ISIS and the pain she has had to endure as a mortal goddess.  We feel her degradation as we see her as a servant, her triumphs as a merchant, her empowerment in China, and her pain when she loses her family in America. In the end, ISIS must choose between the forces of good and evil, while fighting her own feelings of hatred and inadequacy.  What ensues is an ultimate showdown between the gods that will leave you hanging on to the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Shawn James does an excellent job coupling African (Egyptian) mythology with contemporary American social issues like broken families and racial discrimination.  On the surface, ISIS appears to be an action packed fantasy, yet it is much more than that.<br /><br />The novel illustrates the morals of what can and will happen to societies when they lose their religious focus and their familial values.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for quick, adventurous, yet intelligent read that provides a welcome break from the norm.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy...	2003-07-09

Against All Odds	Nevlynn Johnson understands that his very life is a gift from God, and in his book he shares with readers how, through the grace of God, he is alive today.  Johnson was raised by his young mother, and spent much of his childhood in Michigan, in close proximity to his mother's family many of whom were dysfunctional.  In addition, he lacked a close relationship with his father, and was tempted by the call of life on the streets.  Still, he survived.  His mother raised him with a strength that defied her own upbringing.  She was raised by two alcoholic parents, yet she provided her own son with all the love and wisdom she had to give.  As the story of Johnson's life progresses, we follow him throughout his school years, military life, marriage, parenthood, and most importantly, his journey to develop a relationship with God.  Through his successes and failures, he honestly shares his experiences, while taking responsibility for his part and understanding but not denouncing others for theirs.<br />Johnson is a man with a story to tell, and he shares it candidly and openly to anyone who reads his book, FAITH, COURAGE, and WISDOM: A JOURNEY TO MANHOOD.  I appreciated the manner in which Johnson took responsibility for his mistakes instead of blaming his difficult circumstances or others. This is a story that will touch the hearts of readers and truly serve as an inspiration to many.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-09
Unique, Moving and Uplifting	Toiling over how to put my thoughts into letters to make cognizant words, I'm finally here at the point to try to recap one of the most moving books I've ever read. Can you imagine something that may seem to be very small when initially looking at it, but yet once you've been able to inspect it closer you realize that it has had an impact on your life?  This is the easiest way for me to start off telling about MISDEMEANOR by Tanya Marie Lewis.  In only 134 pages, her words managed to pick me up, turn me around, and place me smack dab in the middle of a life-size mirror, that allowed me a glimpse of her characters and then a full screen view of myself.<br />Lewis launches The Craddlerobbers Series, which will focus on older women with younger men, but her story sits at the very top of the list of Christian Fiction titles that I've read.  MISDEMEANOR is not only the story of two Christians, their path to love and the detours they take to get there, but it also shows the impact that God can have in your life when you're ready to receive Him and the blessings He's prepared to bestow upon you.<br />MISDEMEANOR opens with an introduction to eight-year-old Malena Dawson after the death of her beloved father. Unsure of what death is and waiting on her father to return, she speaks freely to God about her feelings, surroundings, and family; yet like with most children that age, she doesn't fully understand what happened. However, she does hold onto her Father's Bible, the teachings she's learned from her parents and in church, and her spirit and belief in God.  The story follows Malena throughout the remainder of her childhood and on to an adult moving from the small Southern town she grew up in and placing her in the hustle and bustle of Atlanta, Georgia. It is in college that Malena rejects everything she's learned as a child, allowing herself to live in a life of sin on a search to further her career.  Yet, in all her success, she finds that she's not happy with herself or the men in her life.  On the surface, it appears that she has it all, yet she's not in the right place to see what God has bestowed upon her because she's turned away from Him.<br />Grant Carpenter is introduced early on in the story as the know-it-all child in Sunday School Class.  Four years younger than Malena, he ignores the age difference, and confesses his love to her, even while they are children.  Though very young, he possesses an \\"air\\" of godliness and knows without a doubt what God has planned for his life.  He's sensitive, loving, and patient, with both Malena and God's vision.  When they are at a crucial part in establishing their relationship, something happens that topples the balance and Malena is left alone to suffer the consequences of her actions.<br />There aren't enough adjectives out there to adequately detail Lewis's writing style and sensitive and loving approach to the story revealed in MISDEMEANOR. It is a compelling and moving story of love, patience, forgiveness, redemption, and fate. Lewis has a natural way of storytelling that takes you deep into the crevices of her characters' mind. Her writing is believable, strong, moving, and uplifting.  Unlike other books I've read that showcased the protagonist growing up, I actually felt the difference in the character as she grew from a young child into an adult coming full term with her decisions in life.  This story also teaches that we shouldn't allow past events to block the blessings that God has in store for us.  It touched my heart, warmed my spirit, and caused days of reflection over my own life and the things I could change to be a better person.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Sharing a Journey	IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME is an intricate blending of a life story with and inspirational message.  Patricia Fortner Redmond shares a bit about her life, starting with her childhood in the Deep South and her first encounters with racism.  She then goes on to share about her high school sweetheart, who later became her husband, and their life together.  Over the course of their long relationship the couple developed a life plan for themselves in which they established goals for their future.  Their life was going as scheduled when their first child Jamilah was born, just as they had planned.  But as Jamilah got older, it became evident that she was not reaching developmental milestones as expected and ultimately Patricia learned that she had a special needs child.  Aside from adapting to the uniqueness of Jamilah's special needs, Patricia felt a great deal of guilt and self-blame for her child's difficulties.  What follows is an arduous journey in which Patricia slowly but surely learns to put her full faith in God.<br />Not only is this book a memoir, but it could also be considered a self-help book.  The author shares the ups and downs of her life with a heartfelt sincerity that will touch all readers.  As she shares the story of her journey, she includes details about the particular Biblical passages or Christian themed books which provided her with the additional strength, encouragement, and skills that she needed to move on.  Although the book would be particularly helpful for other parents of special needs children, this book will truly inspire and strengthen all who read it.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-09

Journey through time	A ROYAL TRIP:  POETRY FOR THOSE WITH SOUL is Glynnis Christian's first published collection of poetry in which she shares her viewpoints on the African Collective.  Broken down into seven sections, A ROYAL TRIP takes the reader on a journey back in time through slavery on to the present, and the future with words of hope.  In her prelude, she states, &quot;I believe the negative effects of slavery can be reversed by becoming familiar with the strengths of our past and beginning to make plans for our future existence.&quot;<br />Christian follows this format of focusing on the past to better the future in a lot of her pieces.  I applaud her on her ability to showcase the beauty of our ancestors along with the pain they endured, however, I did find a lot of her pieces as &quot;angry&quot; and with an accusatory tone.  Considering the subject matter, this didn't detract from my reading and I was delighted when reaching the section on personal relationships.  My most memorable passage while reading this book was in the poem entitled &quot;Throughout the Years&quot; in which Christian states: &quot;You are my existence, your breath is mine.&quot;<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Maybe In Another Lifetime	Alexandria Jones is on the verge of divorce and Gabriel Washington is engaged to be married one week after the two formally meet.  The title suggests that Gabriel loves a married woman but there is so much more to this romance that I often was reminded of and hummed the old tune sung by Billy Paul, Me and Mrs. Jones.<br />A chapter told through the voice of Gabriel's best friend prefaces the story. His voice is wanting and curious and leaves the reader with the same thoughts.  Together, the reader and the best friend travel through the tale of Mrs. Jones and Gabriel.<br />LOVIN' MRS. JONES is not your typical girl meets boy and they live happily ever after romance story. This story is different, heartfelt and captivating. The story explores more of the mind thus there are not many lustful scenes. But fear not, this is not a distraction and the beautiful poems included capture the true essence of the characters' feelings.  Furthermore, Edward Dean Arnold skillfully employs the family members of the main characters into the storyline adding to the complete development and understanding of how they came to be and why.  The conclusion of this story leaves the reader wondering about the future of Alexandria and Gabriel.<br />I highly recommend this novel to romance enthusiasts and readers of other genres as well.

It'll All Come Out in the Wash	Paula L. Woods comes back onto the sleuth scene in her third Charlotte Justice tale, DIRTY LAUNDRY.  This time, our fearless diva is back on the job after an administrative leave, and ready to roll some heads.  After taking on the title of supervisor, Justice is assigned to a case involving a dead Korean girl whose body was found in an alley.  The vic, Vicki Park, was a member of the campaign team for the Latino mayorial candidate, Mike Santos.  Something stinks in the events leading up to Park's demise, and Charlotte and Billie Truesdale are on it like white on rice.<br /><br />In DIRTY LAUNDRY, not only is the Park case part of the plot, but Charlotte's own life transgressions and dirty laundry come out in the open.  She is forced to confront feelings about her family, her career, her fiancee Aubrey, and the passing of her husband and daughter years earlier. A novel about secrets, lies, and letting go, DIRTY LAUNDRY won't disappoint followers of Justice.  Woods' prose is tight and, once again, Charlotte was allowed into my heart.

God doesn�t run a segregated heaven	Blind Faith chronicles the plight of a young couple whose relationship with God is as strong as steel. We flow with them through brief internal conflicts about their relationship, and fight with them through external nuances for validity and acceptance of their relationship. Blind Faith has a spectacular balance of characters. They are well defined, colorful, and brazen. All are strong and passionate in their beliefs and their commitment. The story initially unfolds slowly, but once it gets going, you won't want to put it down. The controversy, conflict, and tension lure your nerves and attention until you reach page 286.<br />We meet Courtney Young three months after she graduates from Northwestern. Courtney belongs to an extremely tightly woven family, which includes aunts, uncles, great aunts, and cousions. All for one and one for all. The Youngs are a middle-class family spinning their future and pride on the present generation of young adults. Courtney is an only child, but labels Aunt Sis' two boys, Edwin &amp; Jamal, her surrogate brothers.<br />Sebastian Alexander Whittington the third is a brash, intelligent, handsome, and rich young man. His family comes from old Boston money. He's at Penn State seeking a law degree and an MBA. He knows exactly what he wants, \\"When I asked you for my soul mate, I had no idea you would make her so beautiful, so radiant, so perfectly suited for me. Let the walls of racism fall down far enough so Courtney and I can climb over into the land that you have established and purposed for us before the beginning of time. I thank you God...Amen.\\"<br />We watch as a budding, yet subdued friendship blossoms between Courtney and Sabastian. As they spend time together Courtney realizes that \\"Sebastian didn't look like her, but he sure thought a lot like her, not in every area, just when it came to their views on education, their careers, the Lord, their families, and even their ideas of how to have fun. Wasn't that what she'd hoped and prayed for in a man? But he was the wrong color.\\" While Sebastian knew exactly whom God had for him, Courtney was still praying for direction. She thought God was slow in speaking to her. She'd soon learn that she was slow hearing God.<br />In this didactic novel Haley gives faces to the many black males who are harassed by the men in blue just because their skin is darker than vanilla. She gives voices to the broad cultural differences between blacks and whites, and highlights that the chasm between the races exceeds past slavery injustices, plowing into modern discrimination that is subtle and backstabbing. She approaches the race `issue' from a heritage perspective leaning back on our familial cocoons at night and showing how we must be bicultural at work during the day.<br />What I liked most about this novel is how Haley presents the flip side of racism...black racism against whites. While she doesn't make you feel guilty or bad, she does make you examine your values as a Christian. She puts religious hypocrites on the spot...those that attend church religiously on Sunday, then forget about God until the next Sunday.

But he was the wrong color.\\" While Sebastian knew exactly whom God had for him, Courtney was still praying for direction. She thought God was slow in speaking to her. She'd soon learn that she was slow hearing God.<br />In this didactic novel Haley gives faces to the many black males who are harassed by the men in blue just because their skin is darker than vanilla. She gives voices to the broad cultural differences between blacks and whites, and highlights that the chasm between the races exceeds past slavery injustices, plowing into modern discrimination that is subtle and backstabbing. She approaches the race `issue' from a heritage perspective leaning back on our familial cocoons at night and showing how we must be bicultural at work during the day. <br />What I liked most about this novel is how Haley presents the flip side of racism...black racism against whites. While she doesn't make you feel guilty or bad, she does make you examine your values as a Christian. She puts religious hypocrites on the spot...those that attend church religiously on Sunday, then forget about God until the next Sunday.

An Interesting Quest	Author Tim Everett incorporates mythology, religion, folklore, and science fiction into his novel HAM AND ABRA IN THE SEED. Everett draws readers into the world of Ham and Abra, two young lovers on a quest to discover the mystery of the seed. In order to marry, they must uncover the truth, and to do so, they enter the past to answer many questions. What answers do they discover in their quest? Will the answers solve the mystery, thus opening the doors to their marriage?<br />Although Everett offers a story with many plot twists and turns, my only criticism was that I felt a lack of clarity in the story's message. While the story is one that is very unique, it left me with many unanswered questions. Despite this, Everett has presented a commendable literary effort and readers of science fiction and mythology will find HAM AND ABRA to be an insightful read.<br />Reviewed by Kanika A.

Wonderful debut effort	What a treat to find a book that isn't the same ole-same ole that we see surfacing on the literary scenes today.  Unfortunately, MONDAY'S CHILD deals with a subject that is not only despicable but also sad to witness, even in between the pages of a book.  Newcomer Brenda Beamon-Isabell introduces us to eight year old Bryce Monday, a cognitively disabled student at Carter Elementary School. The motto of the school is proudly displayed on the front entrance, \\"A Haven of Safety and Learning\\" and Bryce's Mom Beverly has no doubts that this is exactly what she can expect of the teachers who have been entrusted to take care of Bryce.<br />Unfortunately, this isn't the case when the aid in Bryce's classroom reports that Bryce's teacher has physically abused him.  And because Bryce isn't able to speak, that adds an additional twist to the story. Lies are told, teachers are threatened to make them remain silent, and Beverly ends up hiring an attorney to fight her case.  What she uncovers will leave even those deeply involved amazed at the heartless nature in which trusted supervisors have acted.<br />MONDAY'S CHILD is a wonderful read that reaches out to the hearts of parents and shows them a peek inside what could really be happening in the school systems.  It is a sad, heart-wrenching story that should be shared with all new parents, especially those of disabled children.  Though grammatical errors and typos were abundant in this book, I was caught up into the plot and intrigued with what would happen to the characters.  In addition, the book is written in a very basic manner with not much character development, so the reader doesn't really get to see more behind what made the characters tick. Despite those factors, I really enjoyed this story and was pleased to see something new and fresh come across my review list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Never Giving Up	Ernest Hill is known for writing timeless tales with strong themes of manhood.  In his most recent novel, CRY ME A RIVER, he proves that he is indeed at the top of his game.  Tyrone Stokes is home at last after serving a prison term and is full of hope that he can begin to rebuild his life and family.  Unfortunately, bad news awaits his homecoming and he soon discovers that his only son, Marcus, has been sentenced to death for rape and murder in a small town in Louisiana.  Tyrone is riddled with guilt because his own time in jail separated him from his son's life and he feels that he has served as a poor role model.  However, Tyrone feels that he knows enough about his son to be certain that Marcus is incapable of committing the crime for which a jury has found him guilty.  Tyrone walks a fine line as he tries to integrate into a life outside of prison and keep his probation officer at bay, yet he is determined to prove his son's innocence and save his life.<br />CRY ME A RIVER is full of timeless themes like love, redemption, and overcoming obstacles, while its characters are forced to deal with real life circumstances.  It is indeed the kind of story that is sure to become a classic.  The plot is full of tension, the characters have depth, the dialogue is engaging, and as a result it is hard to put this book down.  Hill's special knack for drawing the reader into the setting of the story will have you feeling like you are in Louisiana right along with the characters.  This remarkable literary work is one that should not be missed.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-01
Saving that Last Nerve	In our society, mental instability is looked at as taboo; something to hide behind and definitely not to address with your family and friends, much less seeing a therapist.  It is because of these views that many women don't get the guidance and/or support they need when faced with the frailties of the human psyche.  In an entertaining, yet informative approach, Dr. Marilyn Martin gives us SAVING OUR LAST NERVE:  THE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN'S PATH TO MENTAL HEALTH.<br />Combined with exercises, diagrams, case studies, and statistics, SAVING OUR LAST NERVE is a wonderful resource!  It helps us to realize that there are numerous resources out there that can help improve our emotional lives.  In addition, it shows how to remove and minimize stress in your life in order to live more peacefully.  Not only did I like Dr. Martin's teachings, I also enjoyed that she opened each chapter with an African Proverb.  This book will definitely come in handy for all those who have ever told someone... &quot;you're working my last nerve&quot; and even for those who want to know how to keep from getting to that point.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Journals to Die For	Tabitha Knight is a groupie.  But she sees herself as more.  She thinks that she is providing men with support and nurturing that they cannot get elsewhere.  She grew up in a foster home and tries to find the love, acceptance, and security that she lacks in rich, famous, successful, men.  Using aliases, different ages, and moving frequently keeps Tabitha at the top of her game.  She also keeps a record of all of her encounters in several diaries.<br />Tabitha is enjoying her lavish lifestyle, and one day she is offered the ultimate challenge.  She is to get close to and eventually bring down, Isaac Abraham, an actor with a known preference for under age girls.  Tabitha reluctantly agrees because she is up for the challenge and the hundred thousand dollars she will receive if she is successful.  But she has no idea what she is in for.  When people begin to wind up dead, and the search is on for the information contained in her journals, she discovers that someone will not stop until they have what they want.<br />Omar Tyree has shown considerable growth with DIARY OF A GROUPIE.  He has broken the mold of writing relationship novels to bring us a suspenseful story about one woman's quest for acceptance and the cost of being a groupie.  Tyree takes us inside the world of the rich and famous, while tackling several social issues including celebrities who indulge in relationships with their adoring, underage fans.  I highly recommend this novel for anyone looking for quick, interesting read.  I cannot wait to see what Omar Tyree comes up with next.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-07-01

Enriched with native tongues	Austin Clarke's Giller Prize winning novel THE POLISHED HOE takes place on the island of Bimshire (also known as Barbados) in the &quot;Wessindes.&quot; During one long night of confession and reflection between Bimshire lawman, Sarge, and Miss Mary Gertrude Matilda, a kept woman on the Bellfeels plantation, Clarke's characters ruminate about the lives they have led. Mary calls the police station and tells them she must confess her crime. Sarge comes to the Great House where Miss Mary resides to record her statement, but is caught in a whirlwind of memories about the woman he grew up with, his own experiences and transgressions, and the contempt circulating the island regarding Mister Bellfeels.<br />Enriched with native tongues and a sort of stream of consciousness writing, this is a novel that brought to mind some of the great writers of all time. The prose was lilting, and I often found myself caught in a reverie as the characters related memories from their lives.  It is not a book for the drama lovers who live for fast paced reads; rather it seems to have been written for those who love narration, historical fiction, and carefully crafted characterizations.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-27
Educating With Style	CURLERS AND CONDOMS is an autobiographical account of DiAna DiAna's quest for educating others about AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and safe sex.  A hairdresser by trade, DiAna became interested in learning more about the new, mysterious disease known as AIDS in the 1980s.

DiAna would go on to become one of the most prolific and engaging AIDS activists, not only in South Carolina, but also throughout the United States.<br />CURLERS AND CONDOMS show one woman's strength and determination to educate her community.  DiAna's story is often humorous, but at times it is sobering.  It is a tale of her commitment to make a difference by using her hair salon to educate.

An Inspirational Woman	CARRIE O. AND ME: WHAT A WOMAN GOD MADE tells the story of Linda, and how her life was forever changed by Mrs. Carrie and her husband Mr. Mack.  Linda became a part of the older couples life as a result of a series of tragic events, and they welcomed her into their life, home, and hearts.  Although they were never blessed with children of their own, the couple adopted their entire community and shared their Christian love and awareness of Gods goodness with everyone they encountered.  As the novel begins, both Mrs. Carrie and Mr. Mack have passed away, and Linda, along with other people whose lives had been touched by the couple, reflect over their pasts.  They pay particular attention to the impact that Mrs. Carrie made on their lives.  To add additional depth to the story, Linda has some issues and relationships, particularly the one with her mother, with which she must make peace.  She has to come to terms with these issues so that she can continue to live the life that God has planned for her.  While doing this, she also reflects over her relationship with Mrs. Carrie, the lessons she learned from her, and has to deal with her grief over the loss of Mrs. Carrie from her life.<br />The greatest strength of this book is the character for which the book is named, Carrie O.  Although the events in the story took place after her death, it was touching to read how one woman could make such a large impact on so many of the lives around her.  However, I felt that the author failed to really capture the voices of the younger characters.  Much of the time I found the younger characters saying things that seemed uncharacteristic and out of place for people that age and as a result, I felt that the dialogue was unrealistic at times.  The book could use some additional editorial polishing, to get rid of the typographical and grammatical errors that could be distracting at times.  However, I rated this book as I did because in spite of its weaknesses, it is a story that will draw you in  and tug at your heartstrings.  The author touched on real life issues ranging from alcoholism to teenage rebellion, which any reader can relate to.  Through the character, Carrie O., Ms. Yates has demonstrated how unselfish Christian love can make a tremendous difference in the world today.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerswill draw you in  and tug at your heartstrings.

Martial Arts and More	CAPOEIRA takes us on a journey through time, where past and present collide in a page turning series of events.  It is 2010 and the World Free Style Martial Arts Association has gained a huge fan base and following and has brought martial arts to a whole new level of  popularity.  The main character in the story, Ptah, is the champion of the welterweight division and part of the Dogon Clan.  The Dogons are part of a long family line of people with special spiritual powers and abilities.  Soon readers learn that the Dogon Clan is not without enemies, and that Ptahs journey to remain a champion will delve deeper than his bouts in the ring.  Indeed they become part of his deeper journey into mysticism and to further his spiritual development.  Ptah, along with the other members of the Dogon Clan, are involved in the universal fight against good and evil, but they have to fight these battles in both the physical and supernatural realms.<br />CAPOEIRA is a book that has a little of everything.  Drama, suspense, and fantasy are all wrapped up in this interesting story.  For fans of martial arts, this book is a must read, as the author takes us to a time when martial arts is a sport that can gather arena size crowds like football or boxing can today.  The author carefully weaves in a lot of information about various types of martial arts and incorporates it into the story so well that readers who are not already fans will learn a lot, but still enjoy an otherwise fast paced story.  The elements of fantasy and spirituality add additional depth to the story while the drama and suspense will keep you turning pages.  My only complaint was that at times the author seemed a bit repetitive.  This is a must read for martial arts fans and a book many others will truly enjoy.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-27
Color me brown.	DIRTIED BROWN LEAVES focuses on an un-settling realization of<br />African American rage produced by living in a single parent home<br />and in an uneven racial climate.<br />This rage is projected through the main character Baby, a gifted<br />nine year old girl who is struggling with things beyond her years.<br />Though she is quite comfortable with her near genius status, the<br />crack in her young armor is based on the fact that her father left<br />before she could enjoy the love of a complete family.  Baby is the<br />youngest of three daughters and the one with the most awareness.<br />Her barometer for life is based on her love for her father, her<br />mother's mental state and her association with the other gifted<br />students; and her sense of who she is, is displaced because of it.<br />She is discovering her differences in terms of race, economics and<br />just being a black female.  The story begins with her eager<br />anticipation of a holiday visit by her father, and this is one of<br />the few times she acts her age, as she waits with child-like hope<br />that he's really coming home.  As she battles loneliness and a<br />feeling of unworthiness, poetry is the vehicle that describes her<br />frustration because of his absenteeism.  Baby is often in a mental<br />maelstrom as she seeks emotional and historical definition<br />for her life.<br />With DIRTIED BROWN LEAVES, Kanko is either ahead of, or maybe<br />behind, the literary milieu.  He writes with a voice reminiscent<br />of the protest writers of the Renaissance era. If entertainment<br />is your goal, this is not the book to read; as this is clearly a<br />consciousness raising, issue oriented book.  Told with a good mix<br />of poetry, prose and narrative this one will make you think about<br />the plight of Black folks and the roles of Black men.  I did<br />question the awareness, depth and pervasive negative attitude of<br />nine year old Baby; it felt as though the story was being told by<br />an older voice.  But the message is strong and clear as the writer<br />gallantly chronicles the endurance of African American women, and<br />it has a mesmerizing affect.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brownut the message is strong and clear as the writer <br />gallantly chronicles the endurance of African American women, and <BR>it has a mesmerizing affect.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2003-06-27
For all the Black American Princesses	THE BAP HANDBOOK sheds a humorous and informative light on ladies of the upper/middle-class who have become known as Black American Princesses.  There are four distinct types of BAPs, yet they all have one thing in common they \\"want the best and nothing less.\\"<br />The first type of BAP is the Betty.  She is born and bred into a prominent family and acts accordingly.  The second type of BAP is the Boho.  Like the Betty, she comes from prominent family, but she in unorthodox in her style and her behavior.  The third type is the Butterfly.  The Butterfly resembles the Betty, but she did not come from an important family.  She usually discovers her \\"BAPness\\" in college.  Last is the Bogus.  Just as the name implies the Bogus is a \\"wannabe\\" and is considered to be \\"ghetto fabulous.\\"<br />The book follows these types BAPs from birth until marriage.  It has excellent resources and could also be used as a book of etiquette.  The book's audience tends to be the upper class or upper-middle-class, so unless the reader is a member of those classes, the book may appear to be a little condescending.  Nonetheless, I recommend it as an enjoyable, quick read and reference guide.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-27

Bunkley's magnificent prose and exciting storytelling ability lures us through MIRRORED LIFE with unchecked zeal. This is a mystery/thriller laced with romance. The veiled moral lessons coupled with the colorful plots and penchant prose kept me flipping pages under a small book light way into dawn.

My favorite stories were \\"Blood Brothers\\" and \\"Five Days\\" while the poem \\"Ode to the Black Woman\\" was uplifting and touching to read.<br />Although Wooden displays tremendous wit and wisdom, my only criticism is that with the many varying viewpoints, it was at times confusing to keep track. While the messages and themes presented provide tremendous food for thought, I would have liked to have seen more focus from Wooden on several main points. Despite this, A COLLECTION OF THOUGHTS is a worthy effort and Wooden shows promise as an up and coming author in the literary world.<br />Reviewed by Kanika A.

Standing at All Costs	With choices come sacrifice, and in Dick Gregory's book CALLUS ON MY SOUL, he tells the story of his life and shares with readers both the positive things he gained and the things he has had to forego as a result of his decisions.  He tells of his childhood, which included a life of poverty, racism, and an absentee father.  But more importantly, Gregory shares how he learned as a child to use humor as a way to transcend his difficult life experiences and gain peer acceptance.  This would serve as an omen for the important role that comedy would play in his later life.  As Gregory tells of his developing career as a comedian, readers quickly see the sacrifices that he and his family made in order to achieve the level of fame that he ultimately became known for.  A great portion of the book is dedicated to Gregory's experiences and commitment to social causes.  He relates to readers his experiences in the civil rights and human rights struggles, and tells of his personal experiences with both noteworthy and little known social activists.  He tells of how he and other activists sacrificed their careers, physical safety, and time with family in order to stand up for what they believe in.<br />Because Dick Gregory has played such an integral role in so many historical events relating to civil and human rights, this book is so much more than a memoir.  Anyone who picks this book up receives a new insight into many of the events that shaped the history of the United States.

A Legacy of Hatred	POISON BLOOD follows the adventures of Lee Morgan as he journeys from place to place.  He is trying to outrun the Klan because they are after he for killing a White Man.  As Lee travels through the various locations, the reader sees just how deadly the Klan can be, and how their hatred transcends to anyone who does not share their sentiments about the Black race. Throughout the story we see the dangers of racism and how it spreads and manifests throughout generations.  This is what Clifford Roberts refers to as POISON BLOOD.<br />POISON BLOOD is an engrossing, intelligent novel.  It is extremely graphic and at times a bit disturbing, but it does an excellent job of displaying the hatred that Blacks had to endure throughout history.  POISON BLOOD will definitely cause the reader to have an emotional response and it is not for the faint of heart.

She has a somewhat jaded opinion of love, mating, and the availability of a `good' man. \\"...I know happily ever after doesn't live in my neighborhood. Finding a good man is like...finding a four-leaf clover. You spend hours searching through the grass and never get lucky.\\" Quen Brooks has something to say about Bobbi's ornery attitude towards love, romance, and good men. Quen &amp; Bobbi meet at a class they are both taking. A project on prisons has them paired and butting heads.

A whirlwind of attraction sweeps Bobbi and Quen away into their own love affair; however, the secrets they each harbor and keep from the other creates an undercurrent of danger that could extinguish the fire in their romance.<br />This is an enjoyable love story. It's full of realistic drama that occurs in families and relationships. No sugar coated fairytale situations in this novel.

I truly enjoyed the way Love seamlessly incorporated Tahitian history and scenery into the plot of the story.  The depth of the characters made them more realistic and also added to the story.

GOD'S CALLING YOU, AGAIN! she offers a series of vignettes reflecting Sister Betty's efforts to keep everyone in the church on their proper path with God. All of the stories are tied together and offer up a cast of colorful and outrageous characters. My favorite character throughout the book is Ma Cile, she is the grandmother of two mischievous 10 year olds who are constantly testing her nerves and patience. This was something I could relate to, because when I was their age it was my goal to drive adults crazy.<br />SISTER BETTY! GOD'S CALLING YOU, AGAIN! had me laughing from cover to cover. The author has found a way to marry humor and life's lessons, and the product is hilarious and informative. This is the first time I have read Pat G'orge-Walker's work but it will not be the last.

A Must Read	Where was this book when I was growing up? It is a must read for<br />people mapping out their career goals and planning where they<br />would like to be five, ten, or twenty years from now.<br />Although I'm from an earlier generation and have accomplished<br />certain career goals, I'm still in the work force, thus I can<br />still learn from this book.  What registers with me is that it<br />gives great insight into utilizing tools that can keep you<br />focused and balanced in today's rocky economic workplace.<br /><br />Too often books that are generated as guides to help establish<br />a career track miss the point. They have a tendency to develop<br />ways that become 'wishful thinking' concepts.  However, Mr.<br />Butler's career guide is well put together and relates to day-<br />to-day job decisions. Students, as well as people already in the<br />work force, can learn from this.<br />Overall, this is a great book that can be used as a guide over<br />and over again. His personal experiences and his unique<br />observations, along with good research, have produced a very<br />serious guide. I highlighted several areas of interest on which<br />I will focus to assist in reaching more of my career goals.<br />I applaud Mr. Butler for writing a long overdue book that points<br />out ways to excel in the corporate world.

Because of the subject matter, it is frequently frightening also.

Falling In and Out of Love	End of Dreams is a novel that deals with the love life of Cameron Dickerson.  He is a man that is re-entering the singles scene after a recent divorce.  Through a series of flashbacks, we see how Cameron met, fell in love with, and eventually fell out of love with his ex-wife, Mara, while we simultaneously see how he is coping with being single and dating again.<br />The book is very descriptive, almost to a fault, but gives the reader a real sense of who Cameron is and what his motivations are.  D.C. Douglass does a wonderful job of taking the reader through the journey of a relationship gone wrong: the meeting and courtship, marriage, and ultimately the divorce.  He also shows that there is indeed life after a divorce or break-up.  I recommend this novel to anyone who has ever been unlucky in love as well as anyone who is looking for a realistic view of relationships.

Let me tell you, there is nothing casual about EVERYDAY I PRAY.  It is a powerful collection of prayers that has touched me.

Poetry at its best	The title sets the stage for a very unique poetic approach that Mr. Thornton has so graciously put together, one that will rejuvenate the mind and soul. By any means necessary, MENTAL CONCEPTIONS opens with much to consider as each poem makes deep introspective statements. I enjoyed all the selections and was very impressed with his unique flow of words and the fact that each offering challenges readers to understand what the writer is sharing.<br />'Silver Bracelets' opens with such spiritual depth that the feeling will stay with me. Rejuvenation, mental awakening, spiritual growth and originality are words that barely describe Andre R. Thornton's book. He has created, as one of his poems is titled, 'A Poet's Dream'. The title MENTAL CONCEPTIONS says it all.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-23
Imaginative fantasies unleashed!	BEST BLACK WOMEN'S EROTICA 2 is a collection of passion-filled writings that will definitely arouse your curiosity in erotica.  While reading this book, it causes your emotions to tingle, your mind to be caressed and your sensual longings to climb toward an apex!<br />The collection is that of 20 well written stories; each is uniquely different and allowing the characterizations to seemingly come alive.  It will have the reader quickly turning pages, yearning for more and more!<br />My personal favorite is one titled \\"The Warehouse\\" by Jamyla Bennu.  This artful piece played to vivid imagery, a believable scenario and a sheer tenderness that catered to a passionate discovery of a beautiful coupling.  Kudos also goes to Donna Sherard for her piece entitled \\"Rhythms.\\"  It captured an everyday experience and parlayed it into a titillating, imaginative work.<br />This is my first experience reading erotica, therefore I was uncertain as to what to expect.  However, after reading BEST BLACK WOMEN'S EROTICA 2, I would definitely recommend this genre to other readers.  The selection of writers who submitted their works for this collection should be highly commended their efforts!<br />Reviewed by Nedine<br />of The RAWSISTAZ REVIEWERS	2003-06-23
Let's get unphysical	While there are no formulas or recipes for creating a healthy<br />intimate relationship, there are guides that should enhance<br />the direction a relationship takes.  One such offering is<br />CREATIVE INTIMACY: A Practical Guide to Better Relationships.<br />Laurie Moore holds a Ph.D. in Expressive Psychology, teaches work<br />shop retreats and also writes a column on relationships. She<br />uses 10 subtitles as she offers a fresh perspective to couples<br />who are ready to improve their communications skills. And she<br />offers a way to make their relationship happier and more loving.<br />Some have dubbed her the 'Millennium Relationship Guru'.<br />She describes twelve distinct creative personality types, each<br />of which relates to the world in a different way and she shows<br />ways to identify your personal creative style, and that of your<br />partner. Her emphasis is own self-knowledge instead of self-<br />improvement and her reasoning is if we know better, we will do<br />better.  This is a book well worth reading.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-23
Sci-Fi at Its Best	We all hear the warnings about the ozone layer depleting, the greenhouse effect, and global warming, but we always seem to push these topics to far the corners of our mind.  PAST FORWARD gives a stunning glimpse of what the world would be like should all of the aforementioned things come to past.<br />The world is being tormented.  Violent weather is prevalent everywhere.  Sharp thunderstorms with flooding run rampant in some areas, while other areas suffer from unbearable heat and droughts.  It is estimated that the Earth will only be in existence for seven years unless something is done.<br />Mad scientist, Dr. Cornelius Caracalla, devises a new chemical compound, Caracallium-90, that will allow the ozone layer to replenish itself within a few months.  Although it sounds promising, the compound is highly unstable, but the masses are so excited about restoring the Earth that they dismiss any apprehensions.<br />Randolph Street is an everyday, working man, existing in New York City.  He has become complacent in his job and is homophobic about his homosexuality.  He becomes intrigued with a new employee at his job, Jamal Lane.  Ironically, their paths cross with the infamous Dr. Caracalla and lead them on a science fiction journey that is as exciting as it is unbelievable.<br />Carlton J. Hill's debut novel is science fiction at its best.  It takes the reader on a journey through Earth and beyond, through the past, present, and future where everything and everybody are not who they seem to be.  This novel will keep you intrigued, and turning pages, trying to analyze what is real and what is unreal. PAST FORWARD is a must read for lovers of science fiction or any one looking for a different and modern read.  I eagerly await more from this phenomenal author.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-23
NOT THE ORDINARY MAY-DECEMBER AFFAIR	Imagine being stranded on a tropical island with a stranger.  Imagine that<br />stranger is a man forty years older than you.  Imagine that the two of you<br />fall in love and have a fantasy affair amid the ocean breeze, vibrant<br />sunshine, and palm trees.  Imagine that he is white and you are black.  This<br />is the pretense and dilemma set out in THE GOD'S LAUGHED.  Kaya Casper and<br />Rick White have joined together in a writing partnership that seems to mirror<br />their main characters, Monica and Paul. The result of this union is a<br />whimsically romantic story that constantly ponders the what-ifs of a modern<br />relationship and the hypocrisy of society at large.<br />In THE GOD'S LAUGHED, Monica Sanders, a 22 year old black woman, and Paul<br />Logan, a 62 year old white man, are the sole survivors of a plane crash who<br />find themselves stranded on an island somewhere on the Caribbean coast.  They<br />combine efforts to sustain themselves and during the course of building huts,<br />fishing, and picking fruits they discover they have a lot in common and<br />develop an attraction for one another.  They explore this attraction and<br />uncover a great gift in each other as well as overwhelming happiness in spite<br />of their meager circumstances.  However, Monica and Paul must confront the<br />stark differences between them as they ponder the age old question, `Is love<br />enough?'<br />THE GOD'S LAUGHED is a May-December romance that is further complicated by<br />race.  The authors' writing styles mesh well and it's virtually impossible to<br />tell who wrote what.  The story is a thinking person's romance -- the hearts<br />and flowers are presented with a heavy dose of cynicism about the probability<br />of success of this union.  Casper and White spend a great deal time in the<br />story ruminating over the pros and cons of the age and race gap.  Nonetheless,<br />THE GOD'S LAUGHED is a bittersweet love story for anyone who believes or wants<br />to believe in love.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)<br />The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersDiane Marbury (HonestD)<BR>The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-23

What a Tangled Web We Weave	Dominique &quot;Dot&quot; Thomas has big plans for her relationship with her boyfriend of six years.  She's certain that Jeff will propose to her, and she has a feeling it will be sooner rather than later.  But when she finds two U.S. Marshalls on the other side of her front door asking about Jeff, her dreams are caught in a tangled web of lies.  The Marshalls tell Dot that Jeff isn't really Jeff McDaniels, but Jon B. Sanders, a man who escaped from federal prison eleven years ago. Dot's world begins to spiral out of control when the authorities come to seize the belongings of a man named Jeff McDaniels, a man that doesn't really exist.  Dot must learn to survive on her own.<br />Pat Tucker has come up with a very original plot line in her novel WHEN LOVED ONES LIE.  It isn't the usual relationship novel, but it is laced with drama, deceit, and self-discovery.  There were a few places where I thought an editor's touch would have complemented the book, but overall, this was a fast paced read that kept me turning the pages to find out what happened WHEN LOVED ONES LIE.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-23
Ahead of His Times	Oscar Micheaux was born in 1884 and from childhood seemed to be driven to be different.  Throughout his life he wore many professional hats; he was a successful farmer and author.  But perhaps his most well known accomplishments were as a filmmaker.  There is a fair amount of misinformation about Micheaux which this book clarifies and corrects.  For example, he was not the first Black filmmaker; however, he was one of the most prolific Black filmmakers of his time with an impressive number of silent films and quite a few sound films.  He was able to accomplish this in spite of a national recession and eventual depression, harsh and uncooperative censor boards, limited venues in which he as a Black filmmaker could show his films, financial hardship, and harsh criticism.  Still Micheaux's innovative promotion skills, coupled with his tireless efforts helped him survive and continue producing films.<br />The most fascinating aspect of this book was the fact that many of the issues being faced by Micheaux and other filmmakers during his time are quite similar to those of filmmakers today.  Debates about how it is the responsibility of African American filmmakers to produce quality work depicting African Americans only in their most positive light were perhaps more heated in the 1920's than they are today.  This heated debate was a particular issue to Micheaux because much of his work included controversial themes and not so positive images of African Americans.  While the masses of African Americans seemed to enjoy and support his work and the themes he discussed, the critics and intellectuals of his day often took issue with it.<br />This book paints a historical overview of the times in which Micheaux lived as well as broad overview of his life and accomplishments.  For the most part, this book was an easy read packed with lots of information, but there were times when some of the technical jargon was difficult for a person who has not studied film to understand.  Still I highly recommend this book for anyone that would like to learn more about a pioneer in Black film.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersStill I highly recommend this book for anyone that would like to learn more about a pioneer in Black film.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-07
Inside the NBA	MR. JORDAN GOES TO WASHINGTON is an insiders view of the NBA and the machinations that went on around the retirement of basketball legend, Michael Jordan. Part fiction, part truth, it delves into the inner workings of the NBA and exposes us to Jeanne and her staff who are responsible for keeping the seats in the arenas filled and the stars' faces in the news. While one jarring suspenseful section deals with Michael Jordan being followed on the freeway another deals with messy stories about his personal life showing up in the tabloids. Jeanne must find out who is doing it. Is it an inside job?<br />It is a well-written book with a rather slow plot but would be a great read for any basketball fan.	2003-06-07
Through the Eyes of the Beholder	Malik Ford, a twenty-seven year old, working class family man, has no shame in admitting his need for vengeance. When an act of violence threatens the well being of his family, Malik is faced with a debilitating decision that could ultimately change the course of his life and those around him forever.  Typically in tales that depict scores to be settled in notorious neighborhoods among rival groups, one would expect a shoot out among those groups, but in RAGE TIMES FURY what you get is not what one would expect in this tale of lawlessness.  Told through the voice of Mailk, who is smart and cunning, RAGE TIMES FURY is a bitter, gritty and emotional look into the psyche of a man hell bent on righting a terrible wrong.  Supported by his girlfriend, friends and an entire neighborhood, Malik takes matters into his own hands as he sets in motion a series of events that lead to a dramatic conclusion.<br />RAGE TIMES FURY is a fast paced book that provided some background on many of the characters involved and how they came to be, through Malik's eyes.  Gentles did a very good job of providing the reader with the other characters' emotions by graphically displaying their thoughts and feelings as to the events at hand.  However, I believe the book could have been more developed if the reader would have heard the voice of some of the other major characters, i.e., Soraya, Malik's girlfriend.  I could feel her anguish, her pain but I wanted to hear her voice; nonetheless, this is good example of how our uncontrolled emotions can determine our fate and the fate of others.  Gentles concludes RAGE TIMES FURY with a heartfelt conviction and testimony.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-07
The Freaks Come Out At Night	Whodini once said \\"the freaks come out at night.\\" Nelson George personifies Whodini's lyric in his latest novel, NIGHT WORK.  The main character, with his self-imposed nickname of \\"Night,\\" leads a life that is best kept behind closed doors and underneath the cloak of darkness.  A gigilo, a \\"maintenance man,\\" and an escort, Night has had his share of fulfilling fantasies and dreams of others, but grows restless with his circumstances.  He wants to pursue his dream of not just a singer, but a vocal legend, a Luther, a Marvin, a Maxwell.  But Night gets caught up in the \\"nightlife\\" that he is so deeply entrenched in when a supermodel comes to him for help.  Night's family life also comes to a head when his highly resented father takes ill.<br />George has written a highly charged novel about acceptance, change, and strength.  NIGHT WORK is action-packed and full of surprises, much like his other novel Show & Tell. However, he has added a noir element to his latest release, and the result is sensational.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-07
Bleeding scabs and fading scars	Ben met Helen when he was in what he perceived to be an unbearable solitude. When they began dating, he felt as though he had banished this lonesome existence for good.  But Ben was a writer, he was an artist, and weren't artists meant to suffer in lonely conditions? How else can an artist feel the brunt of life and transform it into art unless he is living in it?<br />FINDING MAKEBA opens with a nineteen-year-old Makeba embarking on a trip into Philadelphia.  Her father is holding a book signing for his new novel, and she has come to see him after ten years of not hearing from him.  The remainder of the book is presented in what seems like a rebuttal.  As Makeba reads the story of her father's life, and how she came to the point where she is, she journals her thoughts and feelings on each chapter.<br />I cannot say that I am surprised that Pate's novel is so affecting, or that the characters are so finely crafted. I have read his work before, and this work personifies the strong emotional content of his other works like Losing Absalom and The Multicultiboho Sideshow.  This is a novel that described things familiar to all who are living - healing the wounds inflicted upon us by ourselves, others, and the world. This is a fine piece of literature and a fine slice of life.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-07
In the Midst of it All	Have you or someone you know been impacted by the effects of drugs? Are you aware of the impact that it brings to the immediate family and those around? Cynthia D. Hunter addresses these questions and more in her book DIARY OF A CRACK ADDICT?S WIFE.<br />Based on a true story and taken from the pages of her actual diary, Hunter takes us into a time frame of over three years.  In this period, she candidly shares the abusive relationship that she endured with her former spouse, Mark. From the surface, Mark seemed to be the perfect partner; however, after the discovery of his addiction to crack cocaine, the relationship dramatically changed, leading to a road of heartache, struggle, abuse, and betrayal. From beginning to end, we are offered a first hand account on how the addiction impacted all involved and how the journey changed her life.<br />Whether you or someone else has been affected, the message that is offered is honest, passionate, and compelling. Many who have already been impacted will relate to Cynthia?s story. While my only criticism is that the distinction between the commentary and actual entries should have been clearer, Ms. Hunter has broken new ground in the literary world by sharing her own story. In the midst of it all, Ms. Hunter has come through, and I applaud her for her courage to make a difference in the lives of those who will come across this tale.<br />Reviewed by Kanika A.

A NECESSARY RESOURCE FOR ALL WRITERS	The LITERARY LAW GUIDE FOR AUTHORS provides necessary information for all writers, both published and unpublished. The mysteries surrounding copyright, trademark, and contracts are explained in clear language absent the usual legalese that is normally predominant in this arena.  Tonya Marie Evans and Susan Borden Evans give insight and debunk myths and misconceptions  that have become legendary in the literary community.  One of the most notable myths that is explained is the \\"Poorman's Copyright\\" that has grown into folklore among the novice writer community.  The authors drive home the point that the only<br />true way to protect your work is to register it with the U.S. Copyright Office.<br />The authors utilize a number of techniques often used in textbooks to illustrate their points.  They highlight common myths, frequently asked questions, checklists and a number of other strategies designed to inform in an easy manner.  The book also comes equipped with a CD-ROM which has sample forms, contracts, and instructions that provide a visual to topics which are discussed in the text.<br />Tonya Marie Evans and Susan Borden Evans provide insight and explanation in areas that are necessary for authors.

It�s a brave new world for sure	In a fantasyland USA of tomorrow, mutant human beings stalk the land. Some are heroes who save \\"normal\\" human beings from disasters such as bank robberies or giant sinkholes that open in busy streets. However, others are bad, just like some regular human beings, and cause distress and pain. John Ridley's heroine, Soledad \\"Bullet\\" O'Roark, doesn't care to make a distinction between the good freaks and the bad freaks; she wants them all dead.<br />Keeping her emotional distance from everyone, she becomes involved in a car accident, and subsequently with the driver of the other vehicle, Ian, who is very similar to Soledad in temperament. They never discuss their past lives, they almost never discuss even the present. They seem, as a couple, to be perfectly happy sharing living space, having sex and not doing much else. Questions cause them to clam up, especially with each other. For a long time, Ian doesn't even know that Soledad is on the M-Tac squad, which was formed specifically to hunt down mutant human beings. When he does learn, he is uneasy, but accepts his new love's job as part of the package. It could be his undoing.<br />Soledad, while on duty, kills a \\"good\\" super human - one who can prevent disasters or reverse the damages from calamities that should have killed people. While Soledad O'Roark feels justified in the killing, the husband of the super freak is angry beyond reason. His specialty is mind control and he can make a regular human being kill him/herself by entering that person's thoughts and controlling his/her actions. He begins stalking the M-Tac squad. He wants Soledad dead. In turn, Soledad wants him badly enough to endanger herself and the entire squad. The battle is on.<br />THOSE WHO WALK IN DARKNESS is a quick read and an interesting one. I do tend to like heroines that have some redeeming values and I found Soledad a little hard to take, yet I couldn't stop reading the book. I knew, at some point, that this woman would have to have some small spark of decency in her.

Who will be the new pastor?	Michele Andrea Bowen, author of Church Folk, has done it again with SECOND SUNDAY. She has given us a deliciously funny and intimate look behind the scenes of the Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church when its  shady minister, Rev. Forbes, unexpectedly dies at a crucial moment for the church. Gethsemane's 100th anniversary is in six months and it entails a lot of planning. They need to have a minister in place as soon as possible but there are warring factions who can't agree. The sisters of the church are tired of the mess and take matters into their own hands. In the background, several marriages are on the rocks, some members are pursuing romantic notions, a white super church is planning a take-over and the greedy are plotting revenge.<br />It is a mix of good versus bad, the saintly versus the sinner, nightclubs, prayer meetings, old men dressed like Super Fly, young hoochies and an all around hilarious time as Sister Louise Williams straightens everybody out. It is a quick and easy source of relaxing entertainment that no one should miss.<br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-07
Can Anyone Love Me?	Regina wanted to be somebody, anybody, someone loved. SOMEBODY'S SOMEONE: A MEMOIR by Regina Louise is the story of Regina Ollison told through the voice of a young Regina, age ten through fifteen.  We hear first hand the account of her life as a foster child in Texas, North Carolina and finally California.  Regina deliberately and painstakingly lays before the reader a first hand account of her ordeal as an unwanted child and what an ordeal it was.  So much so that no child should be subjected to life that Regina led.  While reading, a few questions came to mind such as, why was this child literally abandoned to a family friend with a history of harboring children and allowing their mistreatment by others?  Were her parents so selfish not to want this child but as the years went on, continued to have other children whom they treated like gold?  Were Regina's behaviors so incorrigible that she could not be loved?<br />Through it all, Regina possessed a spirit of wanting, forgiveness and determination that literally saved her from herself and others.  At times her antics were humorous but for the most part, this is a sad account, told with a strong southern dialect, which forces the reader to savor the message that Regina was trying to get across to the adults in her life.  Her voice resonates her need for a mother and a family regardless of color, which is something that no one inside of the system captured with exception of one woman.<br />While reading I was hoping to get a glimpse at Regina today and where she stands. I went to her website and discovered that she is doing wonderful things for children \\"caught\\" in the system.  She is artistically creative and continuously giving of herself through the arts.  Anyone who reads SOMEBODY'S SOMEONE: A MEMOIR will be affected by the life of Regina Louise.  I highly recommend this novel if you can stomach the pain that may come along with it....	2003-06-05
God's Instrument	God called Joshua Clay to preach at an early age. And as a student at Wilberforce University in Ohio, he is working towards his goal of becoming a minister and eventually pastoring his own church. As graduation looms on the horizon, Joshua is given the opportunity of a lifetime, he is offered a position as a missionary in South Africa. This is a very unique opportunity since the story takes place in the 1930's, and Joshua is a Black male experiencing South Africa's system of apartheid. Joshua looks to God for guidance and God leads him to South Africa, on a journey that will change his life. He discovers that the people of Africa are nothing like he imagined; they don't live in the jungle or swing from trees.<br />What he does find is that Blacks are very oppressed in their own land as well, and are considered savages and heathens by the white minority. Even though this seems like a dismal situation, Joshua is determined to make his imprint on the people to whom he will minister. Unfortunately, due to pressures and restrictions from his bosses, conforming to the rules by which he is governed will not be easy for him. As a result, Joshua compromises himself and is blind to the injustices committed against his congregation each day.<br />God should be who Joshua listens to, but his superiors at the mission see things differently, and because of this, life for Joshua is hard. In JOSHUA'S BIBLE, author Shelly Leanne takes readers on a spiritual journey, and she uses pain and inspiration as the guides. This wonderful novel touched my heart and soul and I feel inspired to recommend it to others.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-02
The Power of Love	As black women, we all carry varied roles. From the loving mother to successful businesswomen, we reach out, making a difference in the lives of our friends, colleagues, and loved ones. Sometimes in the midst of our roles, we have a tendency to forget about the key person that truly matters most-ourselves. Before we can truly love others, we must first embrace and cherish ourselves. Jamie Walker encourages this through her book 101 WAYS BLACK WOMEN CAN LEARN TO LOVE THEMSELVES.<br />Sharing from her own personal experiences, Walker encourages us to engage in activities that will cultivate and nurture our heart, mind, body, and spirit. Whether it is journaling, exploring new hobbies, or visualizing our goals and achievements, Walker issues the challenge to look deep within and not be afraid to embrace the complete package. Black women of all ages will be both strengthened and encouraged as they embark on a journey of self-discovery and healing.<br />As a black woman on her own personal journey, I found this book to be powerful, very emotional, and moving to read. I felt that the author at times was speaking directly to me, providing the encouragement and strength that I need as I move forward into new horizons. Jamie Walker offers a book that with an open heart, many can and will find healing. As a young black woman, I am thankful that Ms. Walker heeded the call and wrote a book that all black women, regardless of age should read.<br />Reviewed by Kanika A.

Recipes and More	RECIPES FROM THE ROAD is a collection of recipes that celebrates the diversity of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  The cookbook features recipes from around the world and are sure to please even the most discerning palette.  One of the greatest strengths of this book is its superb organization.  The recipes are sorted by continent or region and then by the specific country from which the recipes are taken.  Before reading the recipes from a given country, readers are provided with a brief overview of the culinary staples, traditions and customs that are inherent to the nation.  This gives readers a more in depth appreciation for the recipes that follow.  At the end of each section, readers are provided with a brief biography about the woman that submitted that set of recipes.  As you read about the varied accomplishments of these women, you cannot help but be further impressed by this collection.<br />With recipes from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Mediterranean, Latin America, and the Caribbean, at times I felt as if this book was taking me on a tour of the world. The addition of the information on the food culture made this cookbook educational as well as useful.  If you are looking for a book that will inspire you through its stories about amazing women, introduce you to the culinary traditions of nearly 40 nations around the world, and tantalize your taste buds, then RECIPES FROM THE ROAD is the book for you.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-02
Tasteful Tales of Terror	Hopkins tastefully begins this consortium of tales by defining and distinguishing between religion and magic. She explains that \\"religion is an institutionalized system of spiritual beliefs...magic is the practice of altering the fated progression of events to suit one's desires.\\" She then reminds us that magic is dangerous, and the ensuing stories support her statement.<br />From the Plateye, mischievous ghost who roam the earth changing shape and identity for deadly self-serving purposes, to the mysterious Udu pots that preserve, and don't forget Uncle Monday who steals souls...or Anansi, a trickster god disguised as an eight legged, wrinkled face spider, these conjured anomalies float through the pages of Mojo to form exquisite stories of characters performing self-serving magic. This anthology mixes modern fantasy with magic folklore and voodoo curses, the result being eerie and mysterious tales that spread your imagination and prickle the back of your neck.<br />Hopkins assembled an impressive reticulation of great writers. Steven Barnes, Tananarive Due, Barbara Hambly, and Marcia Douglas are just a few of the talented contributors. Barth Anderson's \\"Lark Till Dawn Princess\\" was the most intriguing to me. It was more mystery than mojo, and told of singing & performances in the alternative drag queen world. You'll love the point of view.  Gregory Frost's \\"The Prowl\\" was among the cleverest because it is an explosive snatch of black history spun on vengeance. Denise Aminoff had the most daring and disturbing story. It reminded me of an early episode of the X-files.<br />If you enjoy the unknown, the far-reaching, and don't mind stretching beyond the familiar parameters of belief, you'll enjoy these conjure stories.<br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love (MissLove)<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-02
A Tribute to Single Moms	TO MOM, WITH LOVE is a heartwarming and romantic collection of three novellas dedicated to single mothers. The Alonzo Clark Morning Show has decided to sponsor a special Mother's Day contest, in which three special single moms will win a makeover, shopping spree and blind date.  Children are asked to write letters about their mother and why they deserve to win the contest and the winners are selected on the basis of the letters.  Each of the three stories follows this same general theme as authors Deirdre Savoy, Jacquelin Thomas, and Karen White-Owens add their own unique spin on the story line.  The three novellas are interesting and take the same general story line in three totally different directions.  Check out this creative tribute for a pleasant and enjoyable read.<br />Of the three stories, I thought White-Owens' story \\"A Mother for Scott\\" was the most creative because of its initial focus on the relationship between a father and son.  As the story progresses the author even incorporates a little supernatural flair, which is believable and fun.  Thomas' story, \\"The Price of a Mother's Love,\\" reminds readers that it is never too late for true love and it will touch your heart and bring tears to your eyes.  It tells of a character named Kree, who gave up her marriage to raise her younger siblings after the tragic death of their parents.  \\"Fairy Godfather,\\" the story by Deirdre Savoy, shows how sometimes falling in love is just meant to be.  When Alonzo Clark participates in his own contest, he is paired up with a woman that works in the same building, fate takes over and each of their plans for the date, and, indeed, their respective futures, are dramatically changed.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-28
Self Love: The Best Love	As individuals, we all desire love and fulfillment from our loved ones and partners. While many of us are blessed to receive this in a positive, healthy manner, others seek it in such a desperate manner that it eventually leads to heartache and self-destruction. Victoria Warren explores this topic in her novel LOVING IN THE DARK.<br />In LOVING IN THE DARK, we are introduced to Samantha. A professional woman, she is like each of us, desiring love and fulfillment. After a bitter split, she meets Isaiah who she later marries. In the beginning, Isaiah seems to be the perfect mate, but as time passes, Samantha discovers that Isaiah is not all that he seems. Underneath the surface, he is abusive and carries secrets that will later play both a pivotal and life-changing role in Samantha's life. What secrets does Isaiah carry? How will Samantha be affected? The answers will surprise and move you.<br />From the beginning, Warren offers a story that is not only honest, but also powerful and real. Samantha is not simply a fictional character; she is so relatable that she could be your mother, sister, daughter, friend, niece or aunt. Warren allows Samantha's story to speak out with so much passion and emotion that you literally are taken on the journey with her, as if you are her spirit that is by her side. Known as \\"the Writing Messiah\\", Warren has proven this point through this book. She is indeed one author to watch.<br />Reviewed by Kanika (Nika) Wade<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-27
Out of bondage.	This story is catalogued as a book for teens and young adults,<br />but I found it great reading for an older audience. It was<br />written as a result of research done by twenty-year-old Shannon<br />Lanier, a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson and his slave<br />Sally Hemings.  With slavery as the backdrop, this book is an<br />attempt to combine the history of one American family. Amidst<br />the controversy surrounding the biography of Thomas Jefferson<br />and his offspring, Shannon shares his family's story.<br />Many descendants of Martha Jefferson and several generations of<br />historians have resisted the claims of kinship to Jefferson by<br />Hemings' offspring, and they feel these claims will tarnish his<br />legacy. But the information collected by Shannon is not a myth,<br />and it is his belief that he has found the final piece of puzzle<br />to complete the search for the the Hemings' family tree. Shannon<br />never intended to bring shame to Jefferson's legacy, but he is<br />aware that his research will show an unveiled look at a man many<br />feel is beyond reproach.<br />The story is told with a collection of historical essays,<br />interviews and family photographs, and is wonderfully illustrated<br />by Jane Feldman. This is not the Thomas Jefferson we studied in<br />school and there is the strong possibility that this particular<br />information may never appear in history books. Since there are no<br />written records of the slaves' birth, and of the period after<br />slavery was abolished, to substantiate Shannon's claims. The<br />history during these periods was memorized and told by oral<br />historians. But in 1998 DNA tests produced evidence that there<br />is a link between the Jefferson and Hemings families.<br />If nothing else, this story should produce sensitive discussions<br />on how we define our country based on the color of our skin. The<br />introduction by Lucian K. Truscott IV, a fifth generation great-<br />grandson of Jefferson through their daughter Martha<br />Jefferson-Randolph, shares his hope that this story will show us<br />that the worth of a person should not be determined only by what<br />we see.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersughter Martha <BR>Jefferson-Randolph, shares his hope that this story will show us <BR>that the worth of a person should not be determined only by what <BR>we see.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-27
BREATHTAKING!	WHO WILL CRY FOR THE LITTLE BOY by Antwone Fisher is a small book of poetry<br />that packs a mighty punch.

EVERY SOUL HAS A PERSOULNALITY	PERSOULNALITIES:  POEMS FOR EVERY KIND OF WOMAN  is a light-hearted volume of<br />poetry that creatively depicts every human mood and persona imaginable.  The<br />poems are written from a female perspective thus the PERSOULNALITIES are<br />attributed to women, but often the characteristics described  are not<br />exclusively owned by women.  Filled with positive messages that are meant to<br />empower, Heather Covington looks at each facet of womanhood and radiates the<br />positive while offering cautioning advice on the negative attributes.  It is<br />easy to find oneself in at least one of the poems which are simply written<br />with a clever and easy to follow flow.<br />PERSOULNALITIES is a tribute to the tenacity and strength of women.  Ms.<br />Covington presents her thoughts in a clear, direct, yet lyrical manner which<br />makes them appealing to readers who would not typically read poetry and<br />provides a change of pace for seasoned poetry fans.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-27
LOST SOULS ON PARADE	SOUL CIRCUS is a crime drama about the drug game and the consequences those<br />involved in it face.  Set in the backdrop of the violent Southeast section of<br />DC, SOUL CIRCUS gives a glimpse into the lives of local drug dealers fighting<br />over turf and trying to establish reputations in the absences of the fallen<br />kingpin, Granville Oliver, who is involved in a capitol murder case.<br />Derek Strange is a private investigator in Washington, DC tasked with finding<br />witnesses that will make his blatantly guilty drug czar client seem less<br />lethal than he actually is. Strange is a hardworking ex-cop turned PI who is<br />on a quest to right wrongs and heal a thirty year old wound.  Strange is from<br />a different era than the modern drug gangsters. He often reminiscences about<br />past times, music from the Seventies, and recollections of old western<br />flicks.  He has been a presence in his community for over two decades and has<br />managed to maintain a respectable and moderately successful investigation<br />business.<br />SOUL CIRCUS is a slow deliberate read that lays out the drug scene and players<br />in the South East section of Washington, DC.  The supporting characters are as<br />quirky and stereotypical as are their dilemmas.  George Pelecanos' writing<br />style affects the reader like a weathered newspaper reporter who has been<br />working a beat for years.  He knows all of the players and has heard all of<br />the stories and is not surprised by the outcomes.  SOUL CIRCUS is a gritty<br />story that leans on the tragic familiar.  The story would have been richer if<br />Mr. Pelecanos had delved further into the main characters and showed what made<br />them tick.  For instance, while readers meet Granville Oliver and know that<br />he's on trial for murder, the heartless criminal side of him is not shown.<br />What readers see is a reflective man who has come to terms with his situation,<br />but they are not privy to the details of what landed him in this place.<br />Despite that, Mr. Pelecanos paints a vivid picture of street culture in this<br />story that is intriguing and chilling at the same time.  Perhaps one of the<br />reasons the story feels predictable is because of the realness of his<br />descriptions and portrayals.  Mr. Pelecanos is either a great story teller and<br />possibly a great recorder of this tragic culture.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthat, Mr. Pelecanos paints a vivid picture of street culture in this<BR>story that is intriguing and chilling at the same time.

More Than Meets the Eye	Murder mystery with an attempt at romance is an appropriate description of LION IN THE PATH.

When coworker Minerva dies on the job, Aubrey is thrown into a web of familial secrets and is stalked by the \\"Goliath\\".

Not by choice, but by need, Aubrey and Gregory play detectives to solve the mysterious death of Minerva and to unfold the Brice family's secrets.<br />LION IN THE PATH is a well-written, emotional and fast paced book that pits two seemingly unrelated stories together with one dramatic conclusion.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Delightful Coming of Age Saga	Marvin V. Arnett has spun a delightful coming of age saga that starts in 1928 when there wasn't much to be delighted about in the United States. The Great Depression was about to strike, World War II was on its way, there were family tragedies and riots would hit the nation's large cities. In addition, the church sanctioned certain segments of the population making them pariahs. Marvin Sprague's family, although poor with her father working as a cook at a downtown Detroit hotel, managed to share what they did have with neighbors who were less fortunate in spite of the church's disapproval. Her father gave leftover food and her mother, with her magic sewing machine, turned out clothes for children who had only rags.<br />In what was, indeed, a time of segregation, poverty and grimness, throughout the story Arnett's wonderful sense of humor lightens the heavy burden. She tells of the time when she was ten and had read all the children's books in the library. The librarian took pity on her and gave her a restricted adult card. Marvin promptly checked out a steamy adult book causing her father to roar and her to blame the librarian. He chastised the librarian and from that point on Marvin's visits to the library were not as pleasant as they had been; she stopped her regular visits until she was old enough to visit the main branch by herself.<br />The book gives a social history of a time period that many Americans know little about. It has the personal touch that brings the Depression and the Detroit Riot of 1943 alive with characters the reader can readily relate to and empathize with. While each chapter could certainly stand alone, Arnett ties the whole together in a wonderful story that can be enjoyed by everyone.<br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-27
Keeps Raining All the Time	In Inner City Blues (1999), set during the LA Riots, Detective Charlotte Justice burst onto the sister sleuth scene with a vengeance. Now, in the second Justice novel, Paula L. Woods continues the story of this sharp homicide investigator as she searches for the answers surrounding the death of a pioneering black Hollywood director.<br />Charlotte continues to loathe her superior Steve Firestone, who made sexual advances towards her and has her riding the desk, where she is adrift in a sea of paperwork and administrative duties instead of out in the field.  So when Charlotte's comrade Billie from across town tips her to the death of the director, Maynard Duncan, Charlotte is ready to get back down to business.  The death seems strikingly familiar to a recent Kevorkian-like case Billie was an integral part of, and Billie needs Charlotte's help to find out if the two cases are connected.<br />The circumstances surrounding the death of Maynard Duncan allow Charlotte, and her not-so-friendly partner Gena Cortez, a look into the lives of the director and his close associates and into the depths of what Duncan himself dubbed \\"Hidden Hollywood.\\"<br />STORMY WEATHER picks up right where Inner City Blues left off, but adds more insight to Charlotte's family and personal life.  Her beau Audrey and her brother Perris are recurring characters, as are the ghosts of her deceased husband and daughter.  Woods is a great storyteller, and she keeps you intrigued and allows you to easily become enraptured with the newest addition in the Charlotte Justice saga.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2003-05-27

EARL-Ever Always Real Life	In E.A.R.L., rapper/actor, Earl Simmons AKA DMX gives us an uncensored look at his life.  From an abused child with severe asthma to a mischievous young man who had to rob to survive, DMX allows us personal glimpses of his life, to allow us to see what he endured to become the man he is today.  Like his life, the book is filled with ups and downs.  DMX discusses his stints in jail and his addiction to drugs, yet he still talks lovingly about his family and the support that his wife, Tashera, always provided him with, in addition to his love for dogs.  Readers who are fans of rap and DMX's music will appreciate the stories of all the rap battles with some of today's biggest stars, as well as dues he had to pay to make it into the music industry.  Although the book tells many extraordinary stories, the stories are often told out of sequences, which makes the book choppy and a bit confusing at times.  Overall this was a gripping novel that shed light on one of the most prolific artist in the rap industry today.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />...	2003-05-27

Building a Legacy	BUFFALO SOLDIERS begins by featuring excerpts from a speech given by Colin Powell in 1992 at the dedication of a monument to honor Buffalo Soldiers at Fort Leavenworth.  Immediately, readers become aware of the significance of this monument as well as the important role that these soldiers played in defending our nation and in helping to establish the American West.<br />As the story begins, we are introduced to Augustus Talbot, later known as Augustus Sharps and the 10th United States Calvary (Colored) and we follow them through more than 30 years of history in the making.  Throughout the book readers are constantly reminded of the paradox of African American soldiers.  These soldiers faced prejudice and injustice on a daily basis, were provided with hand me down, and in most cases poor quality equipment, yet they defended the United States with unyielding bravery and honor.  When Augustus marries and starts a family, readers become privy to the sacrifice, frustrations and hardship that the families of the soldiers had to endure in order to \\"make a way out of no way.\\"  We are also introduced to some Whites who were willing to stand alone to defend and show respect for the African American soldiers and their families.<br />From the first page, BUFFALO SOLDIERS draws readers into a different time in history where African American men were fighting for a nation that barely recognized them as men, no mind the heroes that they were.  While this is a work of historical fiction, readers will learn a great deal about the history through this wonderful book.  I found myself searching the Internet to learn more about Buffalo Soldiers in general and some of the specific things, like the types of rifles, mentioned in the book.  Willard has written a book that not only educates, but also touches the hearts of the readers.  You feel for the characters as they experience hardships, lengthy separations and even death.  I gained a deeper respect not only for the Buffalo Soldiers, their wives and families, but also for the brave men and women that have followed in their footsteps through military service.  While the Buffalo Soldiers were struggling to build a legacy and gain respect from Whites, they indeed proved themselves to be the greatest of heroes.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerstheir wives and families, but also for the brave men and women that have followed in their footsteps through military service.

An enjoyable read...	Selah's Bed is a hauntingly guttural look into the soul of Selah Wells. Her scars are burned in that crevice that connects a woman's thighs. We accompany Selah on a tumultuous ride through her soul with her pitiful puberty as our tour guide.  We toggle back and forth between the past and present learning why Selah's lifeline is not her husband, but the various other men who share her bed.<br />\\"Sex was a way to stop the crying, the powerlessness of not feeling beautiful. She always felt beautiful under lustful hands. Lustful hands can't lie. The want, greed, and emptiness is real...\\" This isn't a story of self-discovery or self-awareness. No, Selah is already aware that she's got issues. She knows why she has issues. She wears her self-antipathy like a medallion around her neck, carrying her battle scars daily. Selah's Bed marries Selah's childhood with her adulthood, showing the bad links. She had two absent parents. Her mother neglected her and her father left her. The novel chronicles several other childhood events that are the stimuli for Selah's compulsive infidelity. As Selah exposes her soul, it seems as if Adams dissects Selah's soul. We peer deep into Selah's bones, which is how deep her pain goes. Adams is relentless in revealing Selah's introspection.<br />This is a very deep book. It is mostly narrative, with piercing prose comprised of intricate metaphors, and similes that slid off the page into my imagination. Introspective. Initially the sporadic back and forth through time caused me some confusion. I'd loose track of time and Selah's age. Once I adjusted to the time warps, I could easily follow the flow. Selah's Bed is an enjoyable read.<br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love (MissLove)<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-18

Insightful Reflections	DANCE IN THE DARK offers reflections that explores the concept of love and culture in the African American community from past to present day. Along with poetry, Croomes incorporates history and mythology as he addresses the complexity of the issues at hand and how it has impacted us as a people. Croomes offers several interesting pieces throughout the book including \\"Letters to Eve,\\" \\"The Edge of Love,\\" and \\"Diary of an Ex-Queen\\".<br />When I first picked up W. Eric Croomes' DANCE IN THE DARK, I was looking forward to seeing a different but unique perspective from the poetic standpoint. While DANCE does offer a beautiful variety of poetry, the heavy commentary that is presented throughout takes away from the book's overall essence.<br /><br />While Croomes offers poetry that is both passionate and intriguing, my main criticism is that the various essays take away from the book overall. There were times where I felt that I wasn't reading a poetry book due to the content at hand. While I found DANCE IN THE DARK to be interesting, from a poetic standpoint it didn't captivate me as other poets have.

Whether it be a shift in room temperature, an eerie feeling of being watched, or the hunch that something just doesn't feel right, there are several signs to look for when trying to determine if you have an otherworldly visitor.<br />Zenia, a Ukranian-born woman, knows all of these things from the teachings of her her late grandmother. When her husband Adam returns from a business trip in Maryland with the spirit of a young boy on his heels, Zenia soon realizes that they have company.<br />In 1783 a young slave named Winston was killed as punishment for his mother's midnight departure from her Maryland plantation. As reparation for his death, Winston's friend, an unknown ancient entity, skins his murderers and hangs them from trees. Two hundred years later, Winston's spirit is searching for something that only Adam can give him, and something only Zenia can help him achieve, in order to rest in peace.<br />This is an excellent idea for a story, and I like the way it all came together with suspense and intrigue.  I do, however, think that the technical side of this book, namely the editing, represents only a ghost of what this book could really be.  I encourage the author to pursue this novel further with the help of an eagle-eyed editor.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-18

But in Victoria Warren's moving and beautiful book CAN YOU FEEL ME? INTIMATE POETRY FOR THE WOMAN, THE WITCH, AND THE WHORE IN YOU, she captures the true essence of a woman.<br /> The poems are poignant, real and so inspirational.

I highly recommend this book to everyone because it will inspire and uplift.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-18
The night before thirty...	Five women with five very different lifestyles win a contest to hang out with a national DJ and live it up on the night before their thirtieth birthdays.  Sharing a birthdate are one of the few things these ladies have in common at a glance, however.<br />Elise is the old-fashioned girl next door, running her own gymnastics studio and shying away from letting on about her romantic feelings towards Allen, a business associate.  Alecia is the gold-diggin, plane-hopping chica with everything she wants - except for the undivided attention of her beau William, who just happens to be very married.  Catara is the fashion genius who is confident that she will be the next big thing in design, but is self-conscious about her weight.  Tanya is the hustler's girlfriend who wants to move out of the game and into a new life.  And finally, LaShawnda is the once naive, sexually confused sista who longs to be out from under the thumb of her employer, Cicely, who is also her lover. Coming together on the weekend of their birthdays, these women learn from each other's issues and dilemmas.<br />The concept is unique, but I didn't think that Butler allowed me into the psyche of these women as much as I would have liked.  You won't find any earth-shattering profundities in THE NIGHT BEFORE THIRTY, nor will you find any revolutionary literary technique.  However, as a light and entertaining read, this book adequately fits the bill.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-13
Malevolent Matrimony	The Other Woman is an intense surge of raw pain skating on the energy, passion, and vows of an anemic marriage. Our backdrop is busy, vibrant Los Angeles, where our unnamed narrator is an over worked television producer who plays her saxophone at sunset to steady her angst. She knows that her home life and her work life are like two trains headed towards one another on the same track. Her husband of four years, Charles, is a middle-school teacher. She and Charles have sparring schedules that has the narrator sleeping while Charles is teaching, and Charles with lots of time on his hands while the narrator is chasing spitfire news at night. She works long hours, all holidays, every anniversary, and both of their birthdays. Do you see the ensuing problem here?<br />Our antagonist, a gothic, handsome painter named David Lawrence, is hungry for revenge, revenge against Charles. When the story begins, David is relentlessly searching for the narrator. When the two inevitably meet, our narrator's life is marred forever. Thus the adventure begins. David's savage demeanor and primal energy clutches the narrator. She and David unwillingly become intertwined souls, as he pulls her deep into his pool of erotic violence. \\"...He says, `We're already biologically linked.' `Biologically linked?' `With your husband and my wife ........, we've already shared body fluids.\\"<br />This unpredictable wheel of betrayal, vengeance, and lust unravels with clever dialogue, witty metaphors, and a strong storyline. The Other Woman is a story of aching souls, orgasms of pain, and scents of sorrow. I was most impressed with how realistic, intense, and focused the situation and emotions are in the story. I was actually spent reading the narrators thoughts, the marital murmurs, and the streams of conscious. It's a thick story that lands effortlessly.<br /><br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-12
LL Cool J Uncensored	James Todd Smith, AKA LL Cool J, lays bare his heart and soul in this engaging and candid autobiography.  He tells of his somewhat traumatic childhood that was filled with domestic violence, and the affect that it continues to have on his life.  He also gives a realistic, behind the scenes, view of the music industry-the sex, groupies, and drugs.  With emotion he tells of a time in his life that he was not proud of, a time when he was young, immature, and had plenty of money to throw around.  Smith uses his life to teach the lesson to youngsters that we all make mistakes and to view them as a learning experience.  The book also shares some of LL Cool J's opinions about the current state of rap, the murders of Biggie Smalls and Tupac, and other pertinent issues.<br />This book is exciting, inspiring, and heartfelt.  It tells a story of one man's obstacles and triumphs to go from a troubled boy to a multi-platinum-recording artist and actor.  Readers will walk away from this book with a true sense of both James Todd Smith and LL Cool J.  I highly recommend this work.<br />*Note this refers to the Parent Advisory Edition<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-11

Fair treatment for the troops?	Tom Willard's THE SABLE DOUGHBOYS is a continuation of his previous book, The Buffalo Soldiers. Augustus Sharps and his sons are now faced with World War 1. Selona Sharps, wife and mother, is very distressed and wonders aloud how black men can want to go to Europe and fight for the freedom of white men they've never met when they do not have freedom at home. Almost everyday there is news of a Colored soldier being beaten or lynched.  Augustus and his two sons, Adrian and David are of the mind of Frederick Douglas: if black men are ever to be accepted as equals they must fight along side the white men of America.<br />Once Adrian and David reach France everything their mother muttered about comes true. Even though they are officers, white sergeants have more say in what happens to their troops than they do. The sergeants run the military and when Adrian objects to either he or his men being referred to as boys or niggers, he and his men are assigned the worst duty available. The Colored troops are also forbidden to associate with the French women. The frustrations mount as the war progresses and friends are killed or wounded.<br />Willard has written a biting story about war and race in America.

The book is divided into several sections that tell what to do before, during, and after class to ensure success.

Sick of it all	DRIFT is the Robert Lomos' story as he travels through the journey that some of us refer to as &quot;becoming a man.&quot;  The product of a marriage that didn't last, Robert had to grow up when he should have been thinking of little kid stuff: carnivals instead of caring for his baby brother; Little League instead of worrying about his father's infidelity; homecoming instead of witnessing his mother's mental breakdown.  Robert has sees his life take a downward spiral when his aunt takes his mother from San Antonio to Los Angeles, to aid her in her convalescence, and insists he stay behind.<br />Robert lives with his Grams now at age seventeen, and his routine of partying hard, fighting, and cutting school has her at wit's end.  So, she enrolls him in a private Christian school, where she believes he will be saved from the trouble that looms in his path.  However, Robert ends up in even more scuffs and in even more bad situations than when he attended public school.

He decides to get a job, go to Los Angeles and try to convince them that he is now a man, a changed soul who is there to be their saving grace.<br />Manuel Martinez has carefully constructed his protagonist's voice. A strong, resonant narrator, Robert's spirit breathes new life into the first-person format of the novel.

I was tickled at her innocent encounter at camp one summer when she stumbled on the reason why one camper, who was disliked by fellow campers, returned every year<br />to camp.<br />What really caught my attention while reading \\"Why I'm like this\\" was being able to relate to what any young woman experiences while growing up and trying to find her place in life. She tells you of her first intimate encounter, her<br />aspirations and experiences to become an actress, marriage, and finally becoming parents.<br />I enjoyed how the story flowed and her deep affections for her family members especially her grandmother.

Amazing and Inspiring!!	This is arguably the best of Iylana's books!  This book touched me as it was a combination of Ms. Vanzant's personal anguish, trial and tribulations as well as her own victories coupled with the thought-provoking inspiration for which she is famous.  INTERIORS is a story of one woman's personal journey through some of life's darkest valleys and in facing these demons, she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization, self-love and most importantly, self-respect.<br />Although INTERIORS is an autobiographical journey of Iylanla Vanzant's life, it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life.  It is guaranteed to touch some aspect of each reader in an intimately close manner.

The secondary characters<br />bring their own issues, yet they play significant roles as Chyna<br />and Miguel struggle to adapt to different cultures and different<br />sexual standards.  Minor deterrents for me were how the writer<br />transitioned from one scene to another, and the saturation of<br />descriptive adjectives.

The characters Gregory and Grace seemed a little too \\"perfect\\" and their budding romance seemed like something out of a fairy tale.  Derrick's character shows how grief and guilt can change a person, but in the end it is God's grace that eases suffering and pain.

It also covers the affect this abuse has on them and those around them.<br />Sandy, India, and Wanita are all friends suffering through different forms of abuse, but are all tied to each other through their friendship and support of one another.  Sandy, Vice-Principal of an elementary school, is suffering through emotional abuse as she tries to deal with her husband's infidelity.  India is a beauty director for a fashion magazine and is physically abused by her husband. She works hard to put up a front on the outside using make-up and pretty smiles to hide her pain.  Lastly, Wanda's husband belittles her when it comes to things of major importance and leads her to believe that she's not worthy of his love or respect in their marriage.<br />Though a painful subject to read about, SHATTERED VESSELS covers a very important subject that everyone can learn from.  It is a testimony to women in all walks of life that abuse is more prevalent than we would like to believe.  In addition, like the characters in this book, it can affect those who we may think are above allowing a man or anyone else to abuse them in any manner.  It teaches that any form of abuse is unacceptable and should never be tolerated.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-06
A Gathering Place	WILLIE'S MARKET highlights everyday life in a small urban community.  Abe and Winona Stone move to East Liberty from the South and through hard work and a supportive family they are able to purchase Willie's Market and realize a dream.  In addition to being a place to shop, the market serves as a community gathering place, where everyone knows everyone.  But all of the characters in the story including Abe and Winona have a deeper story to tell, and as the story evolves we are reminded that life is much more complicated than meets the eye.  It is this deeper story that will grab you and draw you in as you meet a colorful group of characters that indeed keep the story moving and the reader turning pages.<br />We meet Abe and Winona's son Dwight, whose comfortable home life, and love for Louis Armstrong doesn't outweigh his need to learn his true identity.  Reverend Embry Wilshire, pastor of the neighborhood church, takes his job as spiritual advisor quite seriously, yet he has his own demons to battle.  And Felton, whose bizarre behavior and elusive ways leave most people in East Liberty scratching their heads.  Some of the other characters include a beautician/nude dancer, a washed up singer, a lonely widow, and a homeless orphan.<br />WILLIE'S MARKET is a strong character driven novel that evokes a strong sense of empathy in the reader.  I found myself wanting to understand the characters better and curious about how things would end up.  One of the strengths of this book was that it featured ordinary characters experiencing struggles that were inherently human.  East Liberty could be any place and there were aspects of the characters' personalities and experiences that nearly any one could relate to.  The book dealt with social truths and human truths and kept me enthralled until the last page.  I truly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by Michael R. Lane....	2003-05-06
Save the Children	Lawrence Christopher reintroduces the literary world to Mick Hart with a case that is full of deja vu.  Election Day in Odelot brings a great deal of headline news: the election of its first African American mayor, a car jacking and the disappearance of two teenage girls.  Mick is called to duty to investigate the whereabouts of MARY'S LITTLE LAMB.  This little lamb happens to be the daughter of Mary whose murder Hart solved previously.<br />Hart's investigation leads him to realize that teenagers (our little lambs) are becoming victims of the wolves of the world because they are growing up too fast. These wolves found on the streets and also on the Internet disguised as adults prey on our little lambs. As he ventures deeper into the investigation for MARY'S LITTLE LAMB, Hart is faced with demons from his past. Are these missing teenagers connected?  Will past demons and secrets hinder the search for the missing teenagers?<br />Christopher has done a masterful job with this Mick Hart mystery.  It is a refreshing mystery that captures the reader with witty chapter titles and journal entries. He provides background for the readers to know the history of his characters that are reintroduced from his previous novella, All About Mary, so that one does not need to read it first.  I look forward to the next Mick Hart mystery.<br />Reviewed by Robilyn Heath<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-05
Opposites Attract	Journalist Josie Dawson is known for her extreme liberal views and the blatantly biased stories she presents.  She loves to \\"put people in there place\\", especially those whose views differ from her own.  That is, until she does one interview that leaves her speechless.  Judge Benjamin Braddock is the complete opposite of Josie.  He is an older, distinguished criminal court judge with very conservative views.  Sparks fly when the two meet each other, yet several obstacles stand in the way of their happily ever after. Josie has problems with trust after seeing her dysfunctional family's interaction with men.  Benjamin has baggage from being in a loveless marriage.  They also face the ultimate obstacle when Benjamin is accused of sexual harassment and Josie's editor forces her to write about it.<br />LOOSE LIPS is a wonderful, entertaining read.  It combines romance with a hint of mystery making the book a quick read that is hard to put down.  The situations and characters ring true to life and the reader will both understand and sympathize with the dilemmas of Josie and Benjamin.  Teresa McClain-Watson has done an excellent job with this novel.  I cannot wait to read her next work.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-03
A mile in my shoes	The song paraphrased, &quot;Master, the tempest is raging, ...the wind<br />and the waves shall obey thy will... peace be still&quot;.<br /><br />The title solicits peace from the tempest in the lives of two<br />different women; one stuck in the past and one forging ahead to<br />her future.<br />Bea is thought to be unstable or a crazy old lady, but she's not<br />that at all, it's just that a lot has happend to her in her life.<br />She has lived with years of sadness and until six months ago, she<br />thought there was no one with whom she could share her pain. Her<br />life was tragically changed 50 years ago and she's still searching<br />for peace.<br />Bea's nephew, Richard and, his wife Rachael agreed that Rachael<br />and their three children would live with his Mother to save money,<br />but Rachael hates the arrangement. Bea and Rachael become friends,<br />and even allies and for just the second time in Bea's life, she<br />shares her burden and for the first time she finds a little peace;<br />Rachael finds in Bea a mediator as she struggles to deal with her<br />mother-in-law and a husband who lives in another city.<br />PEACE BE STILL has the premise for a wonderful adventure of two<br />generations coming together in the tradition of good southern<br />living, and for the most part this story accomplishes that.<br />But the flow of chapters at times makes it unclear whose voice you<br />are hearing. Additionally, readers are left wondering about the<br />signifcance of certain occurences, and about an ending that leaves<br />important issues hanging.  Collete writes with a temperate voice,<br />one worth hearing, and one that I will read again.  Her style<br />should capture the attention of readers who love family stories<br />that ring with realism.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewer	2003-05-03
Everything but love or is it?	Being in love with someone is a beautiful experience, but it could be a nightmare if the person isn't aware of your feelings.  To top it off, you're not brave enough to come out and own up to your feelings, so you just sit by and let your best friend make moves on him; not sure if what he feels is more than friendship.  So what happens when he proposes to her and yet, you still love him? What do you do?<br />Nikita Daniels does nothing, instead she prepares herself to stand beside her friend at their wedding and watch the man she loves, Michael Matheson, become unreachable to her forever.  And, just when she thinks there's no stopping the wedding, something happens and Michael is left with no bride, but is stuck with a two-week honeymoon cruise that is already paid in full. He doesn't want to waste the ticket, so he asks Nikita to join him and expects her to provide a friendly ear and continue being the friend she's been throughout the years and help him accept how the wedding ended.  Nikita accepts knowing that he has no idea how she feels about him and sets herself up for two weeks alone in a honeymoon suite with Michael.  Will she finally tell him how she feels and how will he react?<br />EVERYTHING BUT LOVE was a bit predictable to me as well as a conflict of interest with my &quot;friendship meter&quot;.  I simply couldn't imagine doing this to a friend no matter how much I thought I loved the guy.  The saving point in the story is that Dunbar does an excellent job throwing in twists to keep it interesting as well as accurately depicting things we go through when trying to win over someone we love.  It was a nice, romantic story that held my interest, but I would've enjoyed it more if Michael hadn't been about to marry her best friend.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A Little Powerhouse of a Book	Don't allow your plans for a juicy, psychological thriller to be foiled by the smallness of this book.  In just 136 pages, Dasha Kelly introduces us to a character of whom the sharpest James Patterson villian would be proud.<br />Emorie and James have a strong marriage that is threatened when Emorie's good friend Denise alludes to having an affair with James.  Emorie is thrown for a loop by this revelation and then sets out determined to find out what the hell has transpired between her husband and her best friend.<br />Don't let my synopsis fool you, though. This is no ordinary story of unfaithfulness and deceit. Kelly keeps you glued to her novel, feverishly turning the pages to find out what happens when they ALL FALL DOWN.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-03
Compelling and heart-warming	What a delight it was to receive a copy of Francis Ray's latest book, SOMEBODY'S KNOCKING AT MY DOOR.  It was even more rewarding once the final page of the book was read and I sat and reflected on this story which is full of memorable characters and a plot centered on family and love.<br />Kristen Wakefield is an art historian working at an illustrious and well-known museum in New Orleans.  While working to put together the first known collection of nineteenth century African-American art, things take a turn for the worse.  When someone threatens her well-being and her career, she reaches out for help from Rafe Crawford, a skilled carpenter and distant in-law.  Though proficient in his craft, Rafe is battling with his own demons and his inability to trust others and allow them into his life.<br />Kristin's best friend Angelique is working hard to get her doctorate in psychology and has ruled out men in her life.  In a pinky swear of sorts, the two friends vow off men and set out on a course that takes some unexpected detours and leaves both of them on one way streets to love.<br />These characters along with a cast of well-developed antagonists add depth to SOMEBODY'S KNOCKING AT MY DOOR and demonstrate Ray's ability to continuously bring out the well rounded aspects of being in relationships with family and friends and the ups and downs we incur as a result.  Her characters are real, compelling, and heart-warming and the story is one I'd recommend without a doubt.  Her books never fail to engage the reader laving them looking at their own familial ties.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal	2003-05-03
Answering Your Call	What happens when your faith is called into question?  This is the issue that Tonya, the main character in WHEN HE CALLS must battle.  Tonya grew up in an ideal home with both parents, and a strong spiritual upbringing.  While she sometimes resented the rules and limitations put in place by her parents, Tonya respected them and for the most part did the right thing.  When she finds herself the victim of a violent crime, Tonya begins to question the very faith that her parents have instilled in her since birth, suffers from a stifling lack of self esteem, and attempts to put her life and dreams on permanent hold.  As she is healing from the physical and emotional wounds of the attack, Tonya reflects over her life, the choices she has made and the lessons she has learned.  What will it take to jolt her into action and force her to reclaim the life that she deserves?<br />WHEN HE CALLS is a novel that speaks to the fact that we cannot rely on the faith of others to carry us through, instead we must develop our own faith and our own relationship with God.  I would have preferred more dialogue throughout the book, as I think this would have improved the overall pace and flow of the book.  In addition, the sequence of the story was confusing at times because it jumped from past to present a little too much.  I still enjoyed the story and felt like the story line was fresh and creative.  The ups and downs that Tonya encountered, her insecurities and her spiritual growth raised issues that young women in general and particularly Christian women can easily relate to.  Overall, WHEN HE CALLS was a pleasant and enjoyable read.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-03
Having It All	**Review done for the re-released version**<br />Marley seems to have it all.  She is about to marry Gerrard, a man that almost anyone would consider the ideal mate.  Gerrard is from a prominent family and is on the fast track to a successful career and a life in politics.  As the wedding date draws nearer Marley finds herself looking for a little more in her relationship.  After trying counseling and just about anything else she can think of to make things better in the relationship Marley must decide how much she is willing to give up to make a relationship work.  She also must learn to distinguish between her fairy tale image of love and relationships and the reality of being in a relationship with someone else.  Will Gerrard and Marley find their way to nuptial bliss or will Marley decide that she needs more than what Gerrard can give her?  Will she find true love?<br />Jamellah Ellis has written a touching story about one woman's journey to a relationship with God, self acceptance, and ultimately marriage.  Marley's spiritual discoveries throughout the book keep you turning pages and cheering her on.  The Christian messages in this book are subtle but powerful and never preachy.  As Marley transitions from a woman who is at times hopeless and full of despair to a woman of faith in spite of the adversity she encounters the reader can really see and feel the change that occurred in her life as a result of having Christ in her life.  In this way, Ellis has taught many valuable lessons without having to do so explicitly.  I highly recommend THAT FAITH, THAT TRUST, THAT LOVE because it has so much to offer:  a love story with a hint of drama, a story about family relationships that will tug at your heart, and a tale of spiritual growth all rolled into one enjoyable book.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-05-03
Fact or Folklore?	There is greater awareness because of the magnitude of this book and<br />its message. And I'll wager that there are few Americans today, Black<br />or White, who know about the incredible life of Cathy Williams. This<br />remarkable story now has a voice.<br />Once a slave in Independence, Missouri, Cathy Williams lived and<br />worked in the 'big house' as a servant to its mistress. And though<br />being a house servant carried greater privilege and status than<br />that of the field hand, Cathy began to resent the menial tasks she<br />performed as much as she resented her masters.<br />After the death of her owner, and having the good fortune of not<br />being sold to pay debts, Cathy realized that the fundamental premise<br />of slavery was a lie and this life was not her chosen destiny. So in<br />November 1866 she disguised herself as a man, used the name William<br />Cathay, and enlisted in Company A, 38th U.S. Infantry and became a<br />Buffalo Soldier.  As the first and only African American woman to<br />serve in one of the six black units formed following the Civil War.<br />Interestingly enough, Williams was able to become a member of the<br />Army without detection of her sex, and it was imperative that she<br />keep her true identity unknown. Her adventures took her from Missouri<br />to the Mexican border where she served for nearly two years. After<br />her military career Cathy did not envision returning to her roots in<br />Missouri, plus her heart was now in the West. So she married and<br />created a life for herself on the Western frontier, as a business-<br />woman in Trinidad, CO.<br /><br />There is much contention surrounding the validity of Cathy's story.<br />Historians claim Tucker's only source about Williams' alleged service<br />as a Buffalo soldier is based on a newspaper account published in<br />1876 and that there are no official records in existence to<br />authenticate her Civil War service. Some believe it was easy for<br />Williams to get discharge certificates from the 'real' William<br />Cathay and pass it off as her own. And that 'Far too many of the<br />speculations about Williams are colored by a 21st century<br />\\"politically correct\\" perspective'.<br />Yet others offer a more positive analogy, \\"Phillip Thomas Tucker the<br />prize-winning author of The Confederacy's Fighting Chaplain tells<br />this remarkable tale of Pvt.

A Tango with Trouble	Dr. Evander Parker seems to be dancing the routine Paula Abdul and that animated cat danced when they said \\"Two steps forward, two steps back.\\"  It seems that no matter the advances he makes in his psychiatry practice, there is always something there knocking him back to where he was.  Intrigued by an offer to experience the underworld of mob living, he embarks on what he believes is an excellent subject matter for a book.  However, Parker soon finds out that people aren't always what they seem, and a dance with the devil could cost him his reputation, his family, his career, and even his life.<br />I enjoyed the rapid turn of events that Knowles emblazoned.

And thug of the year award goes to�.	Author Roy Glenn has spun a wild story of a thug who has changed his life. Mike Black, also known as Vicious Black, has gotten out of the drug trade, stopped killing as many people and is now running a semi legitimate nightclub and restaurant business. Then he runs into the most beautiful drug dealer he has ever seen.  Cassandra \\"Shy\\" Sims' drug business is sliding and her life is in danger so Vicious is forced to save her life on several occasions.  Neither Black nor Shy totally trust each other even though they are madly in love. Some readers will find it disconcerting that the `hero' and `heroine' have no problem, or residual psychic pain when it comes to sending souls flying into eternity after a quick bullet to the brain. I cringed every time he or his girlfriend killed somebody and justified it to themselves as the right thing to do.<br />Editing would have made IS IT A CRIME a bit easier to follow. The frequent switch from present to past tense and the sudden point of view changes in the same paragraph slowed the reading. .....	2003-05-03

A history of enslavement, the belittling of  racial worth,<br />and internalized racism were a few of the phenomenon cited by hooks as a cause<br />of the pervasive lack of self esteem in Black people.<br />While hooks provides interesting discourse on the subject matter, she often<br />comes off sounding  like a text book  in her discussion of the different sides<br />of this issue.

Journey to self-discovery	Ruth Johnson is waking up after a 14 year marriage to realize that she deserves better.  After suffering both emotionally and physically at the hands of her crazy husband Eric, she pushes him to the edge one last time knowing it could cost her the life that she's decided she wants to hold onto--hers.  Newcomer J.D. Mason shares this excruciatingly painful story with readers in a way that's not only graphic and visual, but also offers the reader a front row seat beside this cast of dynamic characters.<br />Through the pages, we're able to see Ruth's transformation from an abused woman unsure of herself to the new and improved version of a woman who knows what she wants in life.  She has a core support system of friends Bernie, Clara, May and Adrian.  Bernie is the exact opposite of Ruth, takes no mess from anyone and has no problems demanding what she wants from men.  Clara serves as not only a friend, but as a mother-figure and May harbors her own problems, some similar to what Ruth's gone through.  In spite of this, May does help Ruth shed some of the baggage she's carried around through her marriage.<br />J.D. Mason does an awesome job of letting us view the entire journey and transformation of Ruth.  We not only see the physical abuse she received, but also the emotional heartaches she endures.  Through these we see how her state of mind improves and strengthens.  Mason presents issues of self-love and self-worth, overcomoing your fears, and making the most of life when we're expected to fall down and crumble.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

A new voice taking root	Date Reviewed: April 1, 2003<br />A new voice in literature is screaming to be heard, as I learned from reading SAP RISING by Christine Lincoln. A collection of short stories reminiscent of Maxine Clair's Rattlebone, SAP RISING incites a hunger in the reader that is satisfied only by turning page after page.<br />The stories center around characters living in the South during a post World War II America, but their voices are even more resonant than the setting. In these pieces, whose names flow poetically with their storylines, events take place that make you suck in your breath in wonderment, and, at times, heartbreak.<br />Rather than tell you about each story, its plot, and the key players, I will tell you that if you enjoy fierce writing and in-your-face characters, this is a book you will want to read.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-23

Caroline interviews and is hired as the Art Director at an up and coming minority advertising agency.  It is enroute to the interview that Caroline literally runs into Brian Keene and from there the romance takes off, or does it?<br />Several obstacles stand in Caroline and Brian's way; Brian is Caucasian and Caroline is African-American.  However, this does not pose a problem for Brian.  Brian has one-fourth ownership of Inclusions, Caroline's employer; Brian's ex-girlfriend is the Office Manager at Inclusions and, someone is out to kill Caroline for some unknown reason.<br />At Last could best be described as a romance/mystery novel.  There is high drama, anxiety and affirming love between the main characters and their families. The only problem I had with the plot was the romance appeared to be love at first sight.  While I am somewhat a believer in this phenomenon and while it is great to read about, this union appeared over the top from the beginning.<br />Lisa Riley has given the readers plausible secondary characters, some humorous antics, good writing and a true romance read.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

So<br />their antics are obvious, without shame, and met with much<br />resistance. But someone is smiling down on these overzealous<br />moms, because Marcus and Cindi happen to be business neighbors,<br />and their paths cross regularly.

A very enjoyable novel, it keeps the reader engaged until<br />the last page. If I had one comment it would be that Alex Webb is too good to be true.<br />Sometimes she comes off as just a touch self-righteous but that did<br />not stop the flow of a good story well told.<br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-22
A therapeutic read.	Bryce Wright has come full circle with the seasons, and as<br />he looks back over the past year he feels a supreme sense<br />of accomplishment.  This Vietnam veteran now employed as<br />a Mental Health Counsel is ready to annotate his files with<br />closure and hopefully one success story.<br />His client Franklin Cooper has been plagued with the diagnosis<br />of a Manic Depressive Disorder with Drug-Induced Psychosis.<br />Bryce, has been where Franklin is and so he is empathetic<br />toward the suicidal, drug induced behavior of Franklin. He is<br />committed to helping Franklin so he will not become just another<br />statistic, just another young black man lost to society.<br />Franklin's existence hinges on the hope he has in a cardboard<br />shoe box left to him by a father he loved unfalteringly. It<br />was the death of his father that heralded the beginning of<br />Franklin's detachment from life. And it is that very shoe box<br />that serves as a life preserver, rescuing him each time he<br />feels the waters of life eclipsing him.<br />Franklin's Shoe Box tells two stories, one about the challenges<br />teens and young adults confront when they choose to abuse drugs<br />and alcohol. And one about a Vietnam veteran who gets to tell<br />his story with hopes that it will be therapy for those who lost<br />a part of themselves in 'the Nam'.  A catalyst for Franklin is<br />the fact that Bryce served in Vietnam with his father and can<br />fill in some gaps peppering his confused life.  Along with<br />Franklin's issues Bryce realizes he has to help family members<br />who are co-dependent to Franklin's illness.<br />Mr. Davis has written an intuitive story with a  pace that keeps<br />the reader in step with all that is evolving. The  character-<br />ization could have been tighter, but this is still excellent<br />therapy, saturated with painful realism, and renewed hope in the<br />human spirit. This is a good read.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-22
Futuristic Sex	Date Reviewed: March 6, 2003<br />Alien Erotica is a collection of stories that portray a futuristic view of life.  The stories are diverse and intriguing.  They present ideas such as, bugs that enhance brainpower, vampirism, and \\"robo-hos\\".  The stories also carry heavy political, racial, and social ideas that leave the reader with much to ponder.<br />At first I had some misgivings about the title; I thought the book would be about little men from Mars getting their freak on.  But the book is much more than that.  In my opinion, alien in this case means foreign as opposed to extra-terrestrial.  Washington presents several unique and open-minded ideas about the future and sexuality.  This book will arouse you both sexually and mentally.  It is a must read for those who enjoy the genre of science fiction, in addition to any one who is looking for an intelligent, yet sexy read.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-19

Having Sex to Live	Imagine a world in which [love making] exists, but not as we know it today.  Envision a place known as New City aka New York City, in which common diseases, such as cancer or AIDS, do not exist, nor crime, drugs or poverty. Instead, you MUST [make love] five times a day in order to live.  The disease that all residents catch once puberty hits is called CMB or Chronic Metabolic Breakdown.  As a result of the disease, there is no line between [love making] and the emotional aspects of it or the pleasure as we know it today.  Instead, it is merely a tool needed to stay alive.  Buildings are even equipped with special places to [make love] and there are Professional [Love] Providers available to \\"fix\\" those in need.  But what happens when someone questions why the disease exists and desires to feel more than what he's been told he can feel? This is the premise behind SEXLIFE by a.a. clifford (pseudonym for Gary Hardwick).<br />Joe is accustomed to living in the Intelligence Era in which New City is run on advanced technology systems and everyone is intellectual.  In spite of this Joe questions the cause of CMB and wonders if anyone will ever experience the \\"old\\" way of [making love. . He questions this even more when spotting Vella when he feels \\"something\\" just by looking at her.  And, then later, he sees her at a party and during their encounter together, they feel the desire, the emotion, and a host of other things they've been told no one had experienced since the dawn of CMB, it is indeed history in the making.  Joe becomes totally absorbed in locating Vella again to see if what he experienced was real or a fluke and as a result, he puts the safety of his friends at stake and is on the run for his life once the government finds out.<br />SEXLIFE is an exhilerating, imaginative, and original work of art and I look forward to the next book in this planned trilogy. Clifford did an amazing job of catching your attention, making you stop to think \\"what if?\\"  It also makes you appreciate the world in which we live today...one in which [love making] is to be treasured and shared with those you love.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Poetry at its best!	Poetry at its best, you will enjoy this great collection of poems by Guichard Cadet. Lonewolf's Cry is a new classic that will boost anyone's interest in poetry reading.<br />Every selection had a story to tell and you finished with a deep respect for his words and style. One particular selection was very moving titled, &quot;Paradox, Unorthodox&quot;; it commanded my attention and very graciously moved my soul. Another selection, titled, &quot;Step&quot; is a fitting contribution to the historic struggles of the African-American. The icing on the cake so to speak was the final poem of the book titled &quot;How we got Positive&quot;. These and the other similar collections are outstanding poetic salutes to a people and its history.<br />Lonewolf's Cry by Guichard Cadet can't get any better then this. I was elated to sit down and read such an awesome collection of work showcasing one man's poetic style in words and actions.<br />If you want to &quot;feed&quot; your soul, reflect, and absorb great words from a great poet, get Lonewolf's Cry and without a doubt you will enjoy as I have.

With This Ring I Thee Wed	Author Nikki Simone presents a straightforward faith-based guideline for women in their \\"season of singleness.\\"  In her book BEFORE I DO, I WILL, each chapter provides insight into the relationship a woman should seek with God in her quest to be a wife.  It reminds the reader that \\"He who finds a wife, finds a good thing\\" (Proverbs 18:22) meaning that a woman should develop her wifely characteristics before actually walking down the aisle!  The book helps to demonstrate why a single woman should invite God into her life as her husband prior to considering marriage to help prepare her for her future mate!<br />A woman's relationship with God is a popular topic, however, Ms. Simone manages to bring a fresh perspective to the subject.  She does a great job in providing examples and citing Biblical references.  The book flowed easily from chapter to chapter and will capture the reader's attention.  This is definitely a must-read for any single woman desiring to have a closer relationship to God.<br />Reviewed by Nedine Hunter<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-19
A Ride Worth Taking	Best-selling author Zane returns with THE SISTERS OF APF: THE INDOCTRINATION OF SOROR RIDE DICK, another fast-paced, sensual read based upon a short story from her first collection of short stories:  The Sex Chronicles.  With the title of this book, you're given an idea of the plot of the story and the secrets that lie within the closed doors of this prestigious sorority of women who are educated, articulate, beautiful and have no qualms when it comes to their sensuality and the complete fulfillment they expect and demand from those they let into their intimate world.  The Sisters of APF are selective of their members and have chapters spread abroad with yearly gatherings and monthly escapades pulling their members from all walks of life; including college students who may need a little nudge in taking part of the female sexual revolution.<br />After staying home and attending a local college for her undergraduate degree, Mary Ann Ferguson is headed to Hartsdale Law School in Washington, D.C.  She is leaving behind the chicken farm, her parents, eight siblings and her high school sweetheart, Clarence, on a journey to meet new people and further her desire to become a lawyer.  Patricia Reynolds is the resident assistant at the dorm in which Mary Ann lives and though she thinks Mary Ann is a country bumpkin, she sees something else hidden beneath the surface and invites Mary Ann to join her for a meeting with her \\"investment club.\\" Armed with upperclassmen knowledge and seniority, Patricia leads Mary Ann into the secret world of The Sisters of APF, their mission, and the tools necessary to lead her away from her timid, good girl demeanor into an experience that is more fitting...one in which she will not settle for just anything when it comes to sex.<br />As in most of her books, Zane has taken a bold look into the lives of women unafraid to express their sexual wants and desires.  And, while I don't condone all of the activities of this book, I do applaud Zane on yet another story with an underlying theme of being true to yourself and not being a victim in any arena of your life; especially sexually.  No, the sorority does not exist outside of the pages of THE SISTERS OF APF: THE INDOCTRINATION OF SOROR RIDE DICK, but it does help one to see that \\"if they could work hard every day, bring home the bacon, and raise a family then they deserve a little hellified sex in their lives.\\" This is definitely a ride worth taking.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Life Changes	Date Reviewed: February 5, 2003<br /> Strength, determination, and friendship are three words that describe Tangie, Bonnie, Sabrina and Cordelia, the main characters in Jacquelin Thomas' new book A Change Is Gonna Come. They all work at St. Paul County Human Services, trying to help women in need get their lives in order. The problem is that these four women are so focused on the lives of others, they don't seem to recognize their own problems.<br /> Cordelia is a woman of God and on the outside her world seems perfect. Faith is a word that Cordelia uses a lot but it is something that she struggles to  hold on to. When tragedy strikes, will she lose her faith and lose the things most important to her? Can she let go of past hurts and resentments in order to move on?<br /> Tangie appears to be a prim and proper woman, but nothing could be further from the truth. She does not love herself and as a reader you wonder if she can reach within herself and learn to love the person inside or will her promiscuity destroy her?<br /> Bonnie, the listener of the group, takes on everyone else's problems, while inside she is consumed with loneliness. She is hurt because no one ever asks about her problems, but she also realizes that if she doesn't open up and share her feelings the fault will lie wiith her.<br /> Sabrina longs to be rich, loved and provided for, and since she has none of these things,her life is not a happy one. Sabrina's gossipy ways and the joy she experiences from other peoples pain may leave her out in the cold. Will she ever realize her faults and change her ways?<br /> A Change Is Gonna Come is an excellent read. It shows the reader that prayer, strength and forgiveness has the power to change everything. This is an inspiring story that is very realistic and very touching. I highly recommend this wonderful book to others.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-19

One of the keys to financial success pointed out by the author was to develop a \\"fierce\\" budget and stick to it!  Also, the author pointed out that a huge sum of money is not needed to start investing.  LET'S GET FINANCIAL SAVVY helps to define relevant terminology and illustrate differences in various investment vehicles.<br />LET'S GET FINANCIAL SAVVY is more than a periodical document passing through time.

Heroes Who Changed the World	In SCIENTIST, HEALERS, AND INVENTORS, Wade Johnson provides a wealth of information about famous African-Americans who have made ingenious contributions. The book contains not only entries for several well-known individuals such as Benjamin Banneker and Madame C. J, Walker, it also includes several lesser-known individuals such as Susie King Taylor, a Civil War Nurse, and Jan Ernst Matzeliger, the inventor of the shoelasting machine (a machine that allowed for the mass production of shoes).<br />This volume, the third in the Book of Black Heroes series, is educational and informative.  Entries contain a picture and biographical information for each of the individuals.  My only criticism is that the book reads like a textbook and may not hold the interest of children.  Nonetheless, it is an excellent resource for children and adults alike, and would make a welcome complement to any home library.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-19

What You See Is Not What You Get	Hold on to your seats, BEHIND CLOSED DOORS-IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE is a wild and wacky ride through the lives of the Cavanaugh family.  This story begins where SIMON SAYS ended with recurring characters.  The Cavanaugh family is of African-American and Italian descent, filthy rich, and as you read you will learn that most of their wealth comes from illegal gains.<br />The family consists of the patriarch Harrison, his wife Sylvia, their sons Conrad (Connie), Joseph, Christian and daughter Madison.  They each bring their own special trait to the Cavanaugh business.  When Harrison becomes ill, his wife forces him to give up the business to one of their sons.  There in lies the dilemma, which son will he choose?  Connie and Joseph are the two likely candidates; if you did not know that Connie was rich and infamous you would mistake him for a notorious thug from the hood.  Joseph is a prime candidate to take over the business but his altercations with Connie for control and legitimacy of the business, coupled with his unsettled life, leave much to be desired of his ability to run a major empire.  Christian is the financial wizard for the family business who controls and oversees all spending.  However, he is in a loveless marriage and, true to form, was a target for marriage by a scheming gold-digger in college.  Madison's only interest in the business and in life is receiving her monthly stipend, shopping and marrying someone who is equally wealthy.<br />Collen Dixon has penned a novel with many plot twists and turns and several unsavory characters.  Many of the shenanigans are over the top and hard to believe, but they will keep you mesmerized until the end. Although the novel was set primarily in Washington, DC, Ms. Dixon did a superb job of providing Harrison and Sylvia's family history several generations back in New York City and the family's move to Washington, DC.

Tervalon guides us through degrees of separation in Lita and Adele's family, as is common in the Louisiana bayou. Regardless of skin tone, family name, or otherwise, you just never know who may be a blood relative, or who may have done your family wrong.<br /> This was my first time reading Jervey Tervalon. Judging from the cover of this book, one may be led to the conclusion that this is an erotic tale of seduction.  Judging from the title of this book, one may surmise that this is a story of supernatural nuances.  But, judging from the words on the pages in this book, I can gather that this is a fine piece of literature, a novel of monumental characterizations, and, lastly, an author I will definitely be reading again.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-16

Captivating Coming of Age Story	SUCH SWEET THUNDER is a posthumously released novel written in 1963 by Vincent O Carter. Several publishers rejected Carters orginal manuscript and Carter died before he could see his work published. However, the manuscript was found 30 years later by Herbert Lottman  in the possession of Carters girlfriend.  Lottman writes the foreword for the reborn manuscript and the only changes  he made to the novel was the name from its original title  The Primary Colors.<br />SUCH SWEET THUNDER begins in 1944 when the reader meets Amerigo Jones who is a solider fighting in World War II. He is visiting a French prostitute and in her eyes, Amerigo envisions a woman from his youth. The story from this point is lyrical flashback to a segregated Kansas City of the 1920 and 30. The reader sees life from Amerigos perspective as he deals with independence, love, sexuality and respect. Amerigo is a dreamer who realizes many of dreams will be unfulfilled because of his skin color.<br />SUCH SWEET THUNDER is a captivating coming of age story.  It is well written and the novel enthralls the reader with the vivid descriptions of a young mans life. I am glad that Mr. Lottoman found the manuscript and completed the process that Carter started 40 years earlier.<br />Reviewed by Robilyn Heath<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-16
Well worth reading...	WHAT NEXT is a slim book that is chock full of large, common sense ideas about how world peace can be achieved.  Walter Mosley starts off with a scene from his life. His father is explaining to him that he had never felt like an American even though he was fighting for America in the Second World War until he realized that the Germans were actually shooting at him. That must make him a real American.  Finding that he could not live among people in the South who could not accept what he had become under fire, he left the South for Los Angeles.<br />Mr. Mosley gives us an idea of the perceptions of African Americans, being careful to note that African Americans do see themselves as Americans, they do not want to leave this country, nor do they wish to abandon its ideals of freedom. African Americans are aware of the pitfalls of unevenly applied laws and philosophies and they have never had the luxury of self-deception but they are still willing to work to make this country a better place.<br />He outlines several simple solutions to working for world peace. One such idea is getting several people into study groups. Each person takes a different aspect of the news and reports on it to the group.

The Power of Faith	If you have ever wondered how people who lived during slavery survived, THIS FAR BY FAITH is the book you need to read. It is about how religious faith inspired one of the greatest movements in American history, the U.S. Civil Rights movement. With stories told regarding politics, tent revivals and ministers leading rebellions against slavery, you see how in the most trying of times the faith in God and church can prevail. There are numerous pictures of some of our most prominent black leaders, some you know and some you may not know. There are also pictures of sit-ins, voting, lynching and blacks attending church. We learn of William J. Seymour who started the American Pentecostal movement, Charles Price Jones who founded the Church of God in Christ (Holiness) and Charles H. Mason who started the Church of God in Christ, among many other ministers and political leaders.<br />THIS FAR BY FAITH is an indepth book about African American History. In this day and age you can't really imagine being in slavery or being told where you can sit, eat or drink. You realize how strong we are as a people to overcome and endure such demeaning treatment. And how our faith in God pulled us through then, and can pull us through now. This is a MUST HAVE for every African American household.<br />Reviewed by Eraina B.

A sensational novel	Life for Hush McGillen-Thackery got off to a rough start with the loss of both her father and her family's clout in a small rural area in Northern Georgia. However, despite her obstacles as an adolescent, she became one of those people who confronted adversity with an air of challenge. And she turned out to be a strong character in Deborah Smith's SWEET HUSH.<br />  Hush stuck me as one of those people who knows what they are destined for, as she rebuildt her family's empire as one of the heavyweight apple farmers in the state.  The Sweet Hush apple, named after Hush's foremothers, was a sweet and rare fruit, and remained a central theme in her life.<br /> When Hush's son brought home the daughter of encumbent U.S. President Al Jacobs, Hush's quaint, quiet life in the Hollow of Sweet Hush Farms withstood some noteable changes.  Hush had to look, once again, to the apple trees to guide her and console her through decisions she never thought she'd have to make.<br /> As this was my first time reading a work by Smith, I embarked on this reading journey with an open mind. I was looking for a good story with love, action, and lessons. I found these things in SWEET HUSH, a sensational novel.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-16
Non-Stop Suspense	Suspense, intrigue, double crosses, assassinations, Wall Street, and medical miracles consume this book featuring Vic Morgan who continues the fight in Cliff Chandler's latest novel, DEVASTATED.<br />Vic Morgan returns after a year with a new face, after dealing with the death of his wife and finding the persons responsible. Before, he goes back to work, he takes a vacation to Spain to relax and enjoy the memories of his wife who always wanted him to visit Madrid.  While there, he finds out much more then he had ever bargained for and the suspense begins.<br />Vic finds out that his wife is alive and in a coma in a special medical facility in Spain. Although several people know she is alive, it was kept from him for several reasons. Honey, his wife, while being treated in this state of the art medical facility, miraculously recovers. He soon learns that there is a contract out on him and things take a tremendous turn. The story goes nonstop as twists and turns occupy the plot of the story.<br />No one knows who to trust and what lays in wait for him or her next. It is a great who-know-it and who-done-it novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspense is great, and the multiple of characters are unique because Mr. Chandler is able to separate and weave each character with literary style throughout the novel. However, the only thing that caught this reader's eye several times was the grammatical errors that brought the novel down an inch. Overall, it is a great sequel to his installments featuring Vic Morgan.<br />Mr. Chandler does an excellent job in keeping the flow of the story going even when there are several intriguing situations going on at the same time. You were able to keep up and not miss a beat. His style is artistically correct and he's able to keep the reader's attention and focused. I enjoyed the book and look forward to another sequel.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-16
A therapeutic read.	Bryce Wright has come full circle with the seasons, and as<br />he looks back over the past year he feels a supreme sense<br />of accomplishment.  This Vietnam veteran now employed as<br />a Mental Health Counselor is ready to annotate his files with<br />closure and hopefully one success story.<br />His client Franklin Cooper has been plagued with the diagnosis<br />of a Manic Depressive Disorder with Drug-Induced Psychosis.<br />Bryce has been where Franklin is, so he is empathetic<br />toward the suicidal, drug induced behavior of Franklin. He is<br />committed to helping Franklin so he will not become just another<br />statistic; just another young black man lost to society.<br />Franklin's existence hinges on the hope he has in a cardboard<br />shoe box left to him by a father he loved unfalteringly. It<br />was the death of his father that heralded the beginning of<br />Franklin's detachment from life. And it is that very shoe box<br />that serves as a life preserver, rescuing him each time he<br />feels the waters of life eclipsing him.<br />Franklin's Shoe Box tells two stories, one about the challenges<br />teens and young adults confront when they choose to abuse drugs<br />and alcohol. And one about a Vietnam veteran who gets to tell<br />his story with hopes that it will be therapy for those who lost<br />a part of themselves in 'the Nam'.  A catalyst for Franklin is<br />the fact that Bryce served in Vietnam with his father and can<br />fill in some gaps peppering his confused life.  Along with<br />Franklin's issues Bryce realizes he has to help family members<br />who are co-dependent to Franklin's illness.<br />Mr. Davis has written an intuitive story with a pace that keeps<br />the reader in step with all that is evolving. The character-<br />ization could have been tighter, but this is still excellent<br />therapy, saturated with painful realism, and renewed hope in the<br />human spirit. This is a good read.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-04-16

Are you beautiful?	When I first picked up this book, I thought that it was a story about a women's group. As I began to read it however, I quickly discovered that there was so much more to the story. At the heart of the group, The Beautiful Ones, is Carmen, and she was essentially the group's leader. She came up with the concept for this group after reading and attempting to publish a collection of poetry written by her friend since childhood, Spring. The Beautiful Ones is a group that encourages women not only to love and empower themselves but also to love, support and accept one another. It is interesting to watch the group and its members evolve over the course of the book and the positive messages should be read by all women. In addition, Carmen's personal life is explored in greater detail. We watch her as she tries to deal with her own financial and personal issues.<br />I really loved the concept of this book, but I felt as if something were missing in its execution. It seemed as if the author tried to cover too much ground in too little space and this really took away from the book. I found myself wanting to know more about Carmen's relationship with her children, her family and her relationships with the men in her life. I also wanted to hear more about what motivated her to start her group and about the group itself. While Spring's poetry is featured in a companion book, I wanted to know more about her and wanted to better understand how her poetry impacted Carmen's life. I think this story would have been much more powerful and compelling and less disjointed, if the characters were better developed and it was clearer how they all fit together. In spite of this, the powerful messages in this book make it one that should not be missed. The themes prompted me to examine myself and made me wish that I too could be part of the club.<br />On the back cover, this book is described as a woman's retreat and that is just what it is. I enjoyed the book and am anxious to follow this author's growth in future works.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersauthor's growth in future works. <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay <BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-31

The story details the<br />various things Maya's mom tries to make her daughter's hair softer and easier<br />to maintain.<br />This is a wonderful book for parents who are considering locking their child's<br />hair and in search of a tool to \\"show\\" how the hair will turn out.  In addition, I think children and those interested in hair care will enjoy it as well.  The illustrations are done by Beverly Hawkins Hall and beautifully portray the story.

Trust?	Kenya Clarke had what she believed to be the perfect relationship, that is until she caught her boyfriend in the act of cheating on her, on their anniversary nonetheless.  Upset and heartbroken, she meets Scott Hutson.  He is handsome, intelligent, and has a great personality, yet Kenya cannot fully commit to the relationship because of her previous experience.  So she devises a plan to test Scott to see if he would ever cheat on her.  In the end she learns a valuable lesson about \\"playing with love\\" and trusting others.<br />This book gives an accurate portrayal of first love and heartbreak.  The characters are well developed, but seem a bit too \\"perfect\\", with the exception of the cheating boyfriend.  In the end it is a wonderful story that explorers issues of trust, vulnerability, and love amongst teenagers.  I would recommend this book to both young adults who are new to relationships and dating, in addition to those who may have had relationships go wrong and are dealing with trust issues.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-13
The touch of a stranger	Obery Hendricks has taken a scene from the Bible and transformed it into a poetic novel about the conditions of Samaritan women during the times of Jesus. No one knows the name of the woman Jesus talked with at the well in the book of John, chapter 4, but this novel gives her a name. It also takes us through her five tragic marriages and gives her the strength to speak out in a country where women were considered worthless. While the novel takes place 2000 years ago, it is easy to slip into the mood of the book as attitudes and conditions of life for Samaritans under the harsh rule of the Romans and the disdain of the Jews unfolds. Unfortunately, it calls to mind some modern injustices that still exist.<br /><br />Hendricks perhaps takes some liberties with Jesus toward the end of the book that I am sure will ruffle the feathers of some. The novel is an eye opener that explains some of the present day beliefs that we continue to maintain regarding the place of women, what spirituality is all about and above all, what constitutes love.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-13
Reflections	Why do we choose to keep the truth from the ones we love? When you keep secrets from family members, those secrets will eventually turn up when you least expect it. \\"Far From the Tree\\" by Virginia DeBerry and Donna Grant takes you on a soul-searching journey of one family who's forced to come to turns in facing their family secrets and relationships.<br />The storyline revolves around Odella, and her daughters, Celeste and Ronnie. The book takes you on an individual tour of each person's life, different personalities, and the way they view life itself after they have buried their father. Odella has secrets that she wants to stay hidden which involves her past and upbringing. Celeste is the controlling daughter who knows what is best for her mother, sister, and her family, only her way is not always accepted.  Ronnie is a wannabe actress trying to reach that one big break only to find brick walls at every turn.<br />When they are brought together in North Carolina because of land owned by the family, they soon realize another chapter in their lives is about to be written. Harsh realities are soon revealed and they must now face their secrets and each other to begin the healing process.<br />I applaud Ms. Deberry and Ms. Grant on a very well thought out storyline and strong character development that allows you to relate to each person's reality on living and surviving.  Towards the end, reading each page was heart warming and they grabbed you and made you realize how important family is, and further emphasized that patience, support, and trust are the ingredients in establishing a strong family unit.<br />Far from the Tree is a unique book, which is presented with great taste and a detailed precision from the beginning to the end. This is a book that will not disappoint you, but leave you with much food for thought and a better understanding on building family trust and relationships.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-13
Full-bodied, rich, and strong...	Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is a collection of short stories that speaks of growing up black. It is laced with strong characters, a memorable feat when an author only has a few pages to invoke empathy. Few short stories are able to satiate my reading lust. I find myself surprised by their endings and upset that they are over so quickly. I'm usually irritated that the author has invited me into their world, only to leave me hanging.<br />I was not similarly frustrated with this collection.  Each story is full-bodied, rich, and strong, just like a great cup of coffee.  The stories invigorated me like a shot of espresso. I was satisfied that the characters continued their journeys, even if I wanted to know more about where they ended up.<br />For example, in the Our Lady of Peace, a girl moves to Baltimore to teach in the inner city school system.  Frustrated and disgruntled, she struggles to maintain control of her classroom and her urge to move on.  She goes through ups and downs, but, in the end, I was certain her journey continued and I was able to formulate my own conclusions about where her destiny led her.<br />I must commend ZZ Packer for such a bold and raw collection. I was mesmerized by her plots, enraptured by her language, and enchanted by her characters. Packer is definitely a fresh author to watch.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-13

The book is a gathering of 69 poems divided into four chapters, which are titled \\"Upside Down,\\" \\"Outta My Head,\\" \\"Literary Love Affair\\"and \\"Inside My Head.\\"  There is something for everyone in INSIDE MY HEAD.<br />Lewis' point of view may be different than that of the average reader, however, he writes with compelling passion and the reality of life.

Jubilee	A Band of Angels tells the story of Grandma Ella, a character who is inspired by Ella Sheppard Moore who was a pianist for the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University.  We learn that Grandma Ella was born into slavery and freed at fourteen when the civil war ended.  The story details how young Ella worked tirelessly to save money to attend a new school for freed slaves known as Fisk School.  After saving her money and arriving at Fisk, Ella continues working so that she can stay in school and also joins the school chorus.  In spite of her personal efforts, she still faced the very real possibility of having to leave school because the school itself was experiencing great financial hardship.  While school officials had pretty much given up hope of keeping the school open, the school chorus and Professor White, the choir director, believe that they can help save the school by doing concerts throughout the North.  The story then chronicles the experiences of the choir which range from jubilant moments to performing in virtually empty concert halls.<br />A Band of Angels is a book that provides a colorful way to share a proud part of African American heritage with your children.  Colon's illustrations add greater depth to the story and will help children better visualize the events that take place.  While this is a work of fiction, the story is based on real people who selflessly used their talents to keep Fisk's doors open.  The book also provides a good introduction to Negro Spirituals, which were kept alive through the voices of the Jubilee Singers.  In addition, readers will see how this brave group of singers would not let racism quiet their talented voices.  Above all, the story will help inspire children to hold fast to their dreams in spite of the hurdles or difficulties they may encounter along the way.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-13
Love and Friendship have no boundaries...	Just like a steaming cup of black coffee, Tracy Price-Thompson's writing is strong, potent, and a quick shock to your senses. In her sophomore effort, Chocolate Sangria, Price-Thompson displays the craftsmanship of a wonderful storyteller using intriguing scenes, unforgettable characters, and a lesson to be learned and paints a vivid picture of friendship and relationships and the love and pain that can be found within each one. Backing this theme is one of self-identity as the characters search to accept and love themselves instead of relying on the thoughts and comments of others to determine their self worth.<br />Chocolate Sangria brings together two sets of friends with a supporting cast that makes this a well-rounded read. First we have Juanita and Scooter who we watch grow from being the outcasts in their projects to young adults on the move. Juanita \\"Nita\\" Lucas grows up being teased because of her light skin and good hair and is working to define herself and bounce away from using the comments and thoughts of others to determine her self worth. Her best friend, Socrates \\"Scooter\\" Morrison is in a similar situation, yet, it's his sexual identity he's not so sure about. Naturally the two of them connect and become inseparable as they mature from young children to adults. The scenes of their childhood extend from funny to sad, over to the realm of happiness and touches on downright scary, all drawing out the emotions that most of us experience as children. The second set of friends is Conan Lopez and Jorge. Though both are Puerto Rican and live under one roof being raised as brothers, they are as different as night and day. Conan is a giver to not only his family, but to his community, and spends his time juggling his life with the feelings of guilt he has over his brother's death. Jorge quite frankly has issues. He hasn't handled the curve balls life has tossed his way and as a result has turned into a very selfish, manipulative and confused young man.<br />The two set of friends meet, and from that moment on, each of their lives change. At this point, the book takes on a seriousness as it deals with the comings and goings of each character, the impacts of their decisions on each other and comes full circle when it seems as if things are looking up for all of them.<br />Price-Thompson weaves in the intricacies of both friendships and relationships in a manner that's bold, compelling, and insightful. It is riveting and graphic, yet exceptionally moving. Her characters and the storyline range from loving to hateful, yet they are all revealing and evoke many of the feelings we encounter in real life. This is a definite must-read, so clear your calendar, find a cozy spot and prepare to taste completely, savoring each word as if you were sampling a rare blend of smooth-tasting chocolate.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Still grieving her father's death, Regina decides that she will find her relatives and leave the beautiful Hawaiian Islands to develop the relationship with her family that she has always dreamt about.  When she moves to the mainland, North Carolina to be exact, Regina quickly discovers how little she understands her African American culture because she spent her life around native Hawaiians and learns that African Americans are not as they are often portrayed on television.  She also learns that having a family is not as rosy as she had imagined and that blood ties alone do not make people close.  Will she get past her disappointment that her long lost family isn't perfect and make the best of her family circumstances?<br />Regina meets Justin Duval, a retired military man turned interior and furniture designer and is forced to work with him in her new job at a soon to be opened hotel in spite of the obvious tension.  As the two get to know each other Justin can't believe how consumed Regina is with the idea of having a close knit family as he would just assume trade most of his relatives in.  Through each other, both Justin and Regina begin to reevaluate their family relationships.  Will the two find love as well?<br />Gwynne Forster has written a heart warming story of love, loss, and forgiveness.  The story moves slowly, as well it should, because with each page Forster's writing draws you deeper into the story and indeed into the hearts and minds of the characters.  This is a story that most anyone can relate to on some level and is sure to be an enjoyable read.  She has developed the perfect recipe for a great book combining a mound of family drama, with a generous sprinkling of romance.  In spite of the family drama that surfaces in the book, the story is realistic and the issues are never too over the top.  I highly recommend Ms. Forster's latest mainstream literary offering for anyone looking for a book that will leave you begging for more.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewerspite of the family drama that surfaces in the book, the story is realistic and the issues are never too over the top.

His saving grace	A story of a marriage. A story of growth. A story of sacrifice. A story of heart. A love story.  Elizabeth Nunez encapsulates all of these in her latest novel about the Trinidad-born Justin and Harlemite Sally, who are teetering on the edge of their once marital bliss.  Justin, a British literary scholar, is convinced that his wife is seeing someone else.  Sally has become despondent, turned from him in bed, and seems to just be going through the motions. She no longer takes pride in reading the great works, instead turning to self-help books and talk shows for enlightenment. In short, things have changed.  Determined to hold the family together, Justin refuses to accept the fact that Sally may be leaving him.  He endures other trials outside of his marriage in his workplace that get him thinking about what he must do to prevent the ties that bind his family from severing.<br />  Nunez has a beautiful way with language, comforting the reader with her lilting prose.  With this language, she brings a vibrance to her characters that is rarely paralleled.  Don't expect a highly-charged dramatic plotline.  Nunez instead relies on realistic human situations, emotions, and personas to captivate her readers.  This book is titled appropriately, as Nunez handles the trying times of her characters with an abundance of grace.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-04

Judge Not	Julius Carmichael is an eleven-year-old boy who attends a private Quaker school and is about to start the fifth grade. As a new school year approaches, Julius is excited to be going back to school because he has his first male teacher.  Upon arriving he also finds that there is another black student in his class, which is a shock because he is often the only black person in his class. Things get off to a rocky start as Julius makes assumptions and judgements about his classmate and discovers that even he was misjudged by others.<br />Through this book children will learn that it is wrong to have preconceived notions about a person and to judge them without first getting to know them.  Another positive aspect about the book is that it contains worksheets that correlate to each chapter.  These worksheets are an excellent way to generate conversation regarding the issues in the book and a way for parents or teachers to evaluate reading comprehension.<br />This is a wonderful debut novel from a very promising author.  I highly recommend this book for preteens as a way of teaching them not to be judgmental of others. I hope this is the first in a series of books to star the very likable and engaging character Julius Carmichael.&lt;...	2003-03-04
Poetic Wisdom	Bard from par taken, Volume II by Guichard Cadet is a continuation of one<br />of the best collections of poetry that I have ever read. This book is awesome<br />and deserves much applause for the poetic style and depth of words that<br />make you want to read it over and over again. If you read Loneswolf's Cry, Volume I, then<br />you're in for the ultimate treat with his latest book of poetry.<br />The selections feed us the romantic emotions of love gained and<br />so much more. Every selection has a message that truly enters the soul and totally awaken<br />the senses. Although it's very hard to select any specific favorites, three stand out that I am<br />honored to mention, and they are &quot;Serenity&quot;, &quot;Love's Cup&quot;, and &quot;Pleasure Bay&quot;.<br />I applaud Guichard Cadet and without doubt look forward to reading more of<br />his works as they become available. The poetry community will never be the<br />same. &quot;bard from par taken&quot; is unique and politically correct if you enjoy<br />words with poetic wisdom.

In Black &amp; White	After noticing one another multiple times at different places, Scott and Vanessa acquiesce to the attraction pulling at them. They are like any other couple. They meet, they court, and they fall in love; consequently, these lovebirds have a big strike against them. Vanessa is an African-American woman and Scott is a Caucasian man. This interracial couple not only struggles with the given qualms of being in a relationship, but they also deal with the prejudices of society. To make matters worse, both of their families are very brazen and boisterous with their negative opinions about the interracial union.<br />Fate is an amorous love story about two very different people who come together against unfavorable circumstances and impossible people. I enjoyed that Fate was more than a love story. Scott and Vanessa have a tumultuous courting, and Leigh-Starr does an excellent job of leading you through the novel by your emotions.<br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-01
Together Again	Martin Luther King Day provides children with a wonderful introduction to the life and times of Martin Luther King.

More importantly, it sheds life on the man behind the holiday; a brief overview of King's life.  Children will read about King's childhood, education, his exposure to Ghandi, his participation in the Civil Rights Movement, his assassination and much more.  While the illustrations are not particularly elaborate, they mesh well with the story and add to the overall experience of the book.

And We Believe We�ve Overcome	During the unrest of the Rodney King debacle in Los Angeles, a chance encounter occurs between Porter Stockman, a Caucasian journalist and Lenora &quot;Lee&quot; Page, a fellow journalist, who is African-American. When Lee relocates from Baltimore to Philadelphia she again encounters Porter working as a journalist at a newspaper where she has accepted employment.<br />Porter relentlessly pursues Lee as she struggles between the attraction and the reality of dating outside of her race, while Porter claims to have no such feelings of racial unrest, its all irrelevant.  Porter and Lee enter into a relationship that has all the standard clich&eacute;s of dating someone of a different race-the reactions of family, friends and coworkers and the reactions of strangers.  But it is Lee's obsessive behavior with interracial dating that causes Porter to step back and examine his take on race relations in turn raising his consciousness.<br />In Meeting of the Waters, a story about the obstacles faced with interracial dating and the reactions invoked, Kim McLarin portrays her characters in a realistic fashion and tells this story in a smooth, mature and concise manner. Exposed are forces so strong-ignorance, pride, humanity and loyalty, you have to step back and ponder your take, as Porter did.  An honest, meaningful and at times humorous portrayal, you will savor and be forced to think about these two souls, black and white, who had no intentions of coming together but nonetheless did!<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

Children are Angels	Walter Dean Myers has put together a unique collection of poetry highlighting African<br />American childhood.  Instead of using traditional illustrations, Myers gathered a<br />collection of turn of the century photographs of African American children in places<br />ranging from flea markets to museums.  Each of the poems seems to capture the very<br />essence of the corresponding photograph and bring life to the nameless faces within the pictures.  I enjoyed all of the poems in this collection, my personal favorites were \\"Love that Boy\\" and \\"Pretty Little Black Girl\\" which were tributes to Black boys and girls respectively.<br />While I enjoyed this collection, I believe this is a book that will be enjoyed more by parents than by their children.  Still this book is a wonderful tribute to ordinary African American children and our rich cultural heritage.  The stunning photographs along with delightful poems make this book worth checking out.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-01
Captivating and well-written follow-up	Oft times a writer cannot repeat the success of the first novel. However, Christopher Chambers has continued the Angela Bivens series with another captivating and well-written thriller entitled A Prayer for Deliverance (APFD).<br />We meet Angela in APFD relaxing and still recovering from injuries gained in Sympathy for Devil. Angela is summoned from her vacation to help with the investigation of a prominent Washington D.C doctor's murder. This murder is followed by more murders and the investigation takes the reader into the worlds of the supernatural, spells and African mysticism.  We are reintroduced to some characters from Chambers' first novel, which adds to the continuity of the series.  Additionally, Angela gets a new rogue partner, Nadia, who reminds Angela of herself as a rookie FBI agent.  The reader is held captive by the book until the conclusion of this thriller.<br />Chambers does an excellent job weaving his research into his novels.  Readers who reside in the Baltimore-Washington corridor will be very familiar with the scenery in the novel. Angela Bivens is a remarkable heroine and I am looking forward to additional books from Chambers in this series.<br />Reviewed by Robilyn Heath<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-03-01

Tales from notable authors, such as Zane, Tananarive Due, Bernice McFadden, Nelson George, and Timmothy McCann, give the reader different views and insights as to why people have one night stands.  From loneliness, to loss of a loved one, to just wanting to have sex with \\"no strings attached\\", this book has it all and explains the motivations as well as the actual act of one night stands.<br />Although a work of fiction, the book is so graphic and vivid, the stories and characters come to life.

To make matters worse, he has found and fallen in love with his soul mate-his best friend's wife.  Drawing upon all his lessons in love, he must make the ultimate decision-a lifelong happiness with the love of his life, or saving the relationship he has had with his best friend.<br />Alex Hairston has written a beautiful novel that shows how relationships that begin as young as our teenage years are influential in shaping who we are.  Eric's story is engrossing, at times erotic, and is reminiscent of first love and true love.  This novel is a quick, ntertaining read that is both poetic and erotic.

Shadows of My Life	Matriarch Jewell Hightower Shepherd struggles to raise her children and maintain her household often without the help of her husband Solly Shepherd.  Because of Jewell's aloofness she has no friends to call her own but Jewell believes that she does not have time for friends and idle gossip; she has bills to pay and a drunken husband to find and bring home on payday.  To gain a better understanding of Jewell, generation after generation of women within the Hightower family tell their story in The Ebony Tree.<br />We go into the history of the Hightower and Shepherd families as the youngest daughter of six children, Imani, prepares a mini documentary only to be stalled with partial truths by her parents.  It is from these families that we become familiar with Jewell, her goals and her dreams of a better life for her children.<br />Finally, Imani receives an awareness but the most important lesson learned is that we must each come to terms with what it is we want and not judge another life because it is different from our own or does not appear as exciting as we make ours to be.  Told with grace and sympathy, The Ebony Tree could very well be anyone's story.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-15
Marriage and infidelity.	Marriage, A Duet is two novellas linked by a common thread, grief over adultery. The stories examine infidelity and the ultimate consequences it has on a marriage. One is told from the perspective of a woman and the other from a man. A Married Woman...After 40 years of marriage it has come down to Caroline Betts keeping a careful vigil over her husband's deathbed.  And at each occurence of the rising and setting of the sun she relives moments of their marriage. Caroline loves her husband and has some wonderful memories, but what she remembers most is when her husband of then 25 years, fell in love and consummated that love with a younger woman. Caroline is not a talker, so she deals with the betrayal primarily in her own head and we are only privy to her calm icy thoughts about the affair, her husband's voice is not shared with readers. This story is packed with domestic details and hard truths as Ms. Fleming gives readers a combination of sorrow and residual anger along with flashes of relief and optimism. A Married Man...In the second novella David and Marcia Sanderson are trying to put their relationship back together after her liaison with one of David's clients. His anger forces him into a perverse near-madness state because he externalizes his grief over his wife's betrayal, he'd always felt his marriage and his wife were just one baby step short of  perfection.  A distraught David wonders why the truth is so valuable, if it would have been better if she had just not told him, or if she'd lied to him instead. The writer introduces self-help groups and the use of pharmacology to help their marriage, but when none of this removes his bitterness, David resolves \\"no more groups, no more pills, and no more shrinks\\".  He will try to put things together himself, but is his love real enough to forgive, and will there be a happy ending to this marriage? First time novelist Anne Taylor Fleming, a nationally recognized journalist, has written stories that are illuminating and almost unbearably human.

Only With My Sisters	I believe we can all relate to sitting or lying around, talking, eating and discussing life with our sister-friends.  Sometimes discussions lead to topics some would consider off-limits, but not these sisters!  I could actually visualize the scene-preparing the food, inhaling the aroma, anticipating the taste, lounging with shoes off, feet tucked, sleeves rolled, drink in hand and everyone talking simultaneously, as I have been there and done that!<br />Each of the women portrayed has a voice as they navigate through their conversations on sex, self-esteem, maintaining relationships, breakups, hopes and dreams for their children and the all too familiar one of the comparison of their lives as women to the lives of their mothers.  Each women portrayed in this book is different from the other but they maintain a friendship that is supportive, spiritual, loving and downright fun.<br />Embracing the Fire by Julia Boyd is an excellent, sassy, fast paced and thought provoking sister-friend book where life and truth are revealed.The topics will definitely lead to a lively discussion amongst any group of true friends.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

In the background is the well-known beauty salon scene--one of gossip, debates on social and political issues, as well as drama, sex, and lies, and lastly the camaraderie we see in everyday beauty salons.<br />Mildred and Claude have struggled to complete their training and with assistance from her parents, Mildred buys a salon and with Claude as her right hand man, they set up Shampoo Time. A little over a year later, the business is quite successful, yet Mildred begins to change, their friendship crosses over the line into something more, and additional drama surfaces.  As a result, each of them questions themselves, each other, and the future of the salon.<br />This book had an interesting plot and storyline, but both were overshadowed by numerous typographical and grammatical errors and inconsistencies as well as issues with the characters.  I would have liked to know more about them.  In spite of this, I enjoyed the focus on beauty salons and reminisced of times spent getting my hair done and the fun that can be found in this type of environment.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Living by your own rules	First time author Odessa Rose's novel, WATER IN A BROKEN GLASS, is a wonderful addition to any book collector's library.  The manner in which Rose writes this novel is just as vivid and colorful as a newly painted portrait while at the same time drives home the lesson of being true to yourself.<br />She introduces us to Tonya Mimms, a sought out sculptor with the inability to commit to anything other than her art.  Tonya spends the majority of her life hiding out in a studio on the third floor of America's Art Institute working on projects passed on by her mentor.  She's been involved with men before, but never on a long term basis as something just doesn't click with her.  Meanwhile, she's haunted by a girl (Meyoki) that she was drawn to in high school and questions her morals while at the same time trying to convince herself that the feelings aren't real. She's been taught by her mother that \\"women ain't supposed to run with other women\\" so she uses this thought as well as other teachings of going to hell if she sins in various manners.  As a result, she spends all her adult life hiding from her innermost feelings and births sculptures that reflects what her mouth is incapable of saying.<br />It is during one of her times of trying to get away from her thoughts that she meets Malcolm Holland and instantly takes him up on a challenge.  Just when Tonya manages to have both love and sculpting in her life, she meets Satin Pierce, an openly gay bookstore owner.  Although sexually drawn to Satin, Tonya establishes a friendship with her and teeters on the edge of fulfilling the desires stewing inside her.<br />In spite of the comfort her sculptures offer, she quickly falls over the edge and a domino effect happens in her life causing her to lash out at the ones she loves as she deals with the decisions of choosing and following her heart or doing what she's been told is the right thing to do.<br />Odessa Rose has painted vivid descriptions of both the characters and the scenes in WATER IN A BROKEN GLASS and has given us an engaging debut novel.  Though the book touches on homosexuality, a subject that isn't normally approved in society, Rose has done it in a tasteful manner that helps the reader understand the character's feelings.  The plot is driven by both the desires and the judgment of the characters while teaching us to be ourselves and not worry about trying to live our lives to the standards that society or those around us have established.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Race Relations EXPOSED!	Anise seems to have a picture-perfect life, a successful husband, a good career, wonderful friends and family, and material wealth.  But soon her whole world begins to unravel.  Her marriage is in jeopardy when she finds out that her husband is cheating with a white woman.  In fact, her husband begins to resent the fact that he himself is black and tries his best to degrade fellow black people.  If that were not bad enough, she finds that her company is blatantly discriminating against both women and blacks.  After she is passed over twice for a promotion that she was best qualified for, she decides to fight back.  She finds an unlikely ally and a possible relationship with her co-worker Frank.  To add further flame to the fire, Frank happens to be white.  Now she has to face her own prejudice in order to find love and deal with the scrutiny that may result from being in an interracial relationship.<br />Kimberla Lawson Roby has done an excellent job in exposing race relations.  She not only shows discrimination in the work place and amongst whites and blacks, she takes it one step further to include black-on-black discrimination be it color (light vs. dark) or economic.  She also provides a healthy dose of \\"reality\\" about interracial relationship and leaves the reader to ponder about his or her own prejudices.  This is an excellent, quick read that is both romantic and socially conscious.  I cannot wait for the author's next novel, which I hope will be a sequel focusing on the possible relationship between Anise and Frank.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-11
Passion of Every Sort	Tyburn is a passionate tale of love, hate, envy, greed and almost any other emotion you can think of.  Taking place in the late 1700's, Tyburn tells the story of Jessica Dearing and all the men who love her as they journey through a trail of secrets, lies, and battle.  Jessica finds that she is the object of affection for both Edward Stanmore, an Irish pirate and Richard Langhelt an English military officer.  While Jessica is struggling to determine which of the two men her heart truly belongs to readers will become engrossed in a tale of betrayal to friends, family, and country.  With the occasional, yet perfectly timed assistance of a witch named Morag, Jessica handles every obstacle with moral fortitude and strength not often reflected in writings about women in this era.  Even the characters in the book could not help but notice that Jessica had courage and valor that exceeded that of many of the men in the story.  As a result of the constant drama that seems to unfold, unlikely partnerships are developed that make this story both romantic and action packed until the very end.<br />This book is so full of action and the story so multifaceted and complex, that I could not wait to read the next page to discover what was next to unfold.  I was pleasantly surprised by this book and think that it would make an excellent movie.  Stewart Thomas' writing is so intense that it immediately draws the reader in and takes them to another place and time.  I look forward to more from this author in the future...	2003-02-11
Compelling Poetry for the Soul	A combination of four years of writing, Kyran M. Daisy offers beautiful and compelling poetry in his collection Can't Nobody Take Me Away. Separated into five sections, Daisy offers poetry that addresses issues and emotions on many different levels. While `Not A Child' introduces us to a girl who experiences the pain of sexual abuse, `Should I Wait for You' addresses love and a key crossroads in a relationship. Daisy's poetry will stir you and each piece touches an emotion in words that are simply breathtaking.<br />As a lover of poetry, I have read many great poets but Daisy's poetry compelled me in a way that was honest and real. I felt a strong connection with many of the pieces and I hope that this is not the last that we hear of this captivating man. Kyran Daisy has truly shown that he is indeed \\"here to stay\\".	2003-02-11
A Powerful Combination of Strength and Love	When Michael Ondaatje spoke of author James Baldwin, he responded, \\"If Van-Gogh was our 19th-cetury artist saint, James Baldwin is our 20th century one\\". This statement is clearly evident in Baldwin's novel If Beale Street Could Talk, a masterpiece that will move readers in more ways than one.<br />In the story, we are introduced to Fonny &amp; Tish. They are a young couple, in love and looking toward marriage and building a life together; Tish is also expecting their first child. When Fonny is arrested and jailed for a serious crime, instead of waiting Tish fights for Fonny's release. She is also determined to deliver the child that is a symbol of their love and from beginning to end; we see the power of love and the realities of life that even today is an absolute truth.<br />With many twists and turns, If Beale Could Talk is an emotionally charged masterpiece with honest themes and characters that are relatable. James Baldwin is truly an author who has made a mark and this is one literary work that is truly recommended---for all the literary world.<br />Reviewed by Kanika (Nika) Wade<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-11
Romance and Danger	Whatever It Takes, Ms. Garcia's sophomore novel, is a light romantic<br />mystery that balances disappointments and dreams. The book cover is<br />inviting and it entices you to kick back and enjoy the balmy breeze.<br />Aspiring author Carleena Treadwell takes a hiatus from school and<br />travels to a Southwest Florida Island to complete her book deadline.<br />She severs ties with her fianc&eacute; because she needs to dedicate<br />exclusive time to pursuing her dream and she realizes that he is not<br />the 'one' for her.<br />Dr. Omar Henderson, needing a vacation from his practice and his over-<br />zealous fianc&eacute;e, is on the island to refresh, reflect, and regroup. An<br />encounter in a local florist shop has Carleena and Omar enthralled.<br />One would think since they are still shaking the dust of undesirable<br />relationships from their feet they would tread with caution, but the<br />magic of the island may ignite other ideas.  The secondary characters<br />add the element of mystery to the story and Carleena is caught in the<br />middle.<br />Ms. Garcia blends the mystery with the love interests as she showcases<br />the mystique of this quaint island. Whatever It Takes written in a<br />narrative voice seems to make the characters less embraceable and the<br />mystery left me wanting a little more. I applaud the author for leaving<br />the ending to the reader's imagination. All the pieces were there but<br />she did not solve the puzzle.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-11
Missing Pieces	I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up the debut novel by new author Olympia Vernon. The title suggested to me that I was beginning a story about the concept of Eden, a place where old age ceases, evil is nonexistent, and a place of abundance.  Quite the opposite was true.<br />Maddy Dangerfield, a fourteen-year old with the weight of the world on her shoulders, lives in a place that defies Eden and all of its niceties. Maddy's mother, Faye, sends her to care for her Aunt Pip, Mama Faye's outcast sister.  Pip suffers from breast cancer and the loss of her breast. Maddy learns much from Pip, and this stop in her journey to adulthood takes on an important role.<br />There was a strong theme of missing pieces in the novel, beginning with Maddy's father Chevrolet, who was missing his arm, and ending with Maddy herself, and all of the losses she incurred.  The writing spoke to me in hushed voices, Vernon allowing her words and lyricism to come to the forefront.  You won't find a largely plot-driven novel in Eden, as the author allows focus to remain on her characters and their losses.  A symbolic tale of coming of age and coming to grips, this was a fantastic debut...	2003-02-11
Great Insight!  Very Informative!	Don't underestimate JUST THE FAQs ABOUT GOD by Max Anders!  It may appear to be simplistic, almost comical just by judging a book by its cover, but let this be a lesson learned - this book provides clear insight into 40 frequently asked questions (FAQs) about God.  The questions range from the creation of the Universe to the uniqueness of humanity, from worship and reverence to God to an explanation for pain and suffering.  Each section is explained in a simplistic, yet detailed manner providing many scripture references as well as citing other literary works.  I especially liked the summary at the end of each section as well as additional scriptures to reference.<br />Mr. Ander's should be commended for compiling such an awesome study tool!  I would definitely recommend this for anyone's quest for a closer, personal relationship with God.<br />Reviewed by Nedine Hunter<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-11

Definite Page-Turner	Vengeance Is Mine by Cliff Chandler is a fast paced novel of love, hate and revenge that takes place in the United States and the Caribbean. Vic Morgan and his wife Honey, are on their honeymoon in San Juan when thugs who want to kill Vic, a policeman, murder her. Vic doesnt escape for very long. Soon he, too, is a victim of the drug dealers and the chase is on. His friend, Jess Norman, grieves the loss of his fellow officer and partner and vows to find those responsible.<br />Against a backdrop of high-class money launderers, drug cartels, plastic surgery, reformed crooks and devious policemen it is often difficult to tell the good guys from the bad. The good reaches into the depths of evil and the bad stretches high into government. No one is ever what he or she seems on the surface. It is a reflection of life as it really is  not as wed like it to be. The plot twists and turns and keeps the readers attention. It is a definite page-turner.<br />Reviewed by Alice Holman<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-05
Looking Behind The Mask	Using the lyrics to a song recorded by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, author and paster Otis T. McMillan delivers to us his first book, The Tears of a Clown:  Masks - What Do They Really Hide?  A Look Behind the Mask!  With clarity and reverence he spreads his teachings of getting past pain in life to fully appreciate the joy that is being bestowed upon you.  Further, he stresses inner healing and the importance of looking inside to overcome the masks that we wear throughout life.<br />Written in short chapters of what reminded me of sermons, to include scriptures, song titles, and other lessons, I was taken to early Sunday mornings with this book.  It motivated and inspired me and though I don't read many books more than once, this is one that I hope to read over and over again to reap the full benefits of it.<br />My only issue with the book were the typos, but Rev. McMillan's strong voice overpowered those and as a result, the only thing I can envision that would be more of a treat would be to sit and hear one of his sermons in the congregation of his church.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

No Stone Unturned	HEART FULL OF GRACE is an excellent collection of famous quotations by people of color accumulated throughout the years. It serves up sixty-two various topics ranging from achievement to dreams,from love to victory and many more, yet the prevailing feeling I received from this book was an overall sense of history. It touched upon excerpts from various time periods reaching past the days of slavery and coming up to present day.  HEART FULL OF GRACE borrows its name from a famous saying from the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., however, this book contains tid bits from well-known figures such as Benjamin E. Mays, Malcolm X, Duke Ellington, and Gwendolyn Brooks, just to name a few! It also borrows from traditional songs and sayings, and even heard the voices of unnamed slaves and folklore.<br />Due to its diverse range, I think this book has the ability to reach anyone, anywhere.<br />Nedine Hunter<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-02
A picture, A thousand words.	Rundu, the photographer for the highly successful MEN...RUNDU STYLE<br />calendar line, and winner of 12 national and world awards, has graced<br />the world of photography with another masterpiece.  WETDREAMS, a coffee<br />table book, features poetry and erotic photographs that highlight the<br />sensual beauty of African American men.<br />This daring photographic milieu, described as 'writing with light', is<br />all male and holds nothing back as it vividly displays full frontal<br />nudity that is tastefully done in Black-and-White prints. Rundu creates<br />images in a wide variety of subtle tones, from blue to brown blacks, and<br />each one intensifies the beauty of the male body. The simplicity of the<br />photographs is titillating and the author's artistic concept and style<br />make the subjects and the landscape one with each other. The photographs<br />viewed from varying angles seem to beckon the reader to come a little<br />closer.  No special effects are needed as Rundu leads your senses into<br />a plethora of fantasies that are straight-on and uncut. The closing poem,<br />Antique Bath, speaks volumes, and as Rundu whispers to the men, I lean in<br />close and listen.<br />  'In a laid back and relaxed kind of way<br />  Your body's saying all it needs to say'<br />  --Verdi<br />Treat yourself to a quiet sabbatical with WETDREAMS, Erotic Photographic<br />Journey to Black Men.

Omitted Diva	When we are asked of jazz vocal pioneers, the names Ethel, Billie, Ella, and Dinah roll off our tongues without contemplation. However, Iain Cameron Williams, in his book Underneath a Harlem Moon, introduced me to a diva who had been omitted from the history books.  This diva is Adelaide Hall.<br />  Born on &quot;the rough side of Brooklyn&quot; and raised in Harlem, Adelaide Hall became one of the most famous black Broadway and cabaret stars, rivaling the legacies of Florence Mills, Ethel Waters, and the like.  Williams traces her journey from an ordinary gal from New York to a famed singer, dancer, and actress, the world over.<br />  Williams, a friend of the late Hall, has definitely done his homework. I could tell that he had sat with Adelaide many a time while she related her stories to him in great detail.  While I understand that Williams was trying to set a backdrop for Adelaide's story, I felt as though too much time was spent on the histories of her surroundings and her contemporaries, such as Al Capone, Josephine Baker, and even the Duke himself.<br />  I feel like the proverbial wool has been lifted from my eyes about where female jazz vocalists really began.  I took the time to research Adelaide further, and even got a chance to listen to some of her recordings.  I can now see clearly, after having read Underneath a Harlem Moon, getting to know Adelaide, and hearing her crooning voice, the profound effect she had on divas past and present.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-02
All Aboard!	A Black owned cruise line catering to African Americans setting sail on it's maiden<br />voyage, serves as the setting of Marissa Monteilh's latest literary offering, The<br />Chocolate Ship.  The story focuses on a group of friends that have all decided to<br />cruise the high seas in style on this brand new ship that is likened to a &quot;Black Love<br />Boat.&quot;  While at sea the characters experience new love, lust, friendship and<br />betrayal during the seven day cruise none of them will ever forget.<br />The concept behind this story was nice, but I felt that the book fell short due to<br />lack of adequate character development.  Since the history of the characters was<br />either omitted or glossed over, I never understood what motivated the characters to<br />behave as they did.  Additionally, there were too many primary characters and with<br />character development and backstory lacking, I found myself having a hard time<br />telling the characters apart.  I never felt any sort of connection to any of the<br />characters and this really took away from the story. I enjoyed the unexpected<br />surprises in the plot but I felt the story was a bit too rushed and simply tried to<br />cover too much ground. In spite of my problems with the book, I did find myself<br />wanting to read until the end.  This book is sure to spark some interesting<br />discussions.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-02-02

His mother, a recovering alcoholic, and his father, a workaholic, have been known in the past to treat him with neglect and indifference. However, it seems as though the winds of change have been blowing since Jason took a fall from a tree that left him in a coma.  When he woke up, his mother swore to him that she was going to quit drinking and treat him more like a son and less like a punching bag.  He is able to make friends, and life doesn't seem so harsh.<br />But, with the good comes the bad.<br />A vivid nightmare entraps him, portraying in stark realism someone or something coming after him.

Twists and turns abound, hearts skip beats, and nails are bitten as the reader is transported to a dark and surreal world known as &quot;Thunderland&quot;.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28
Running Away From Secrets	Ronda is a young woman with a lot of secrets, who is trying to get beyond her past and develop a closer relationship with God.  However, her relationship with God seems to get repeatedly put on hold because of her need to have a relationship with a man at whatever cost.  As a result, she has had several unhealthy relationships that add additional weight to the trunk of secrets she carries around with her.  But most of us know that all secrets eventually become exposed and so as you read Why I Kept My Past a Secret you may find yourself wondering if Ronda and her fragile relationships can handle such exposure.<br />This book was an interesting read that shows how you may be haunted later, when you try to bury the past without dealing with it.  I felt at times the story could have been sequenced better and there were certain aspects of the story that could have been explored in greater detail.  Still, the author did a good job at helping you understand the turmoil that Ronda experienced, and the overall concept of the book was good.  While this book may leave you wanting more, it is still a quick and compelling read.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28

Hatch offers an array of characters, as he brings to life the<br />offsprings of Rose, Cicero, and Cicero's sister. He peppers the pages<br />with some historical giants, Booker T. Washington and Frederick<br />Douglas. He also introduces many unknown people of color who helped<br />create a magnanimous history. People like the election workers led<br />by a Black sheriff named John Brown who pursued a sharecropper's<br />boycott until insurrection strikes in a little-known piece of<br />history which resulted in the Friars Point Massacre.<br />Rose and Cicero renamed the swamp 'Africa', because they still clung<br />desperately to customs from which they had been taken. And there is<br />much controversy over the fact that this prime real estate is owned<br />by the former slaves, and wanted by the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley<br />Railroad. The dwellers of the town, now being run by the off-springs,<br />know that the birth of the railroad would certainly be the demise of<br />their town.<br />Africa Love, set in 1886, is an indepth account of life during and<br />after the Civil War.

You are Not Alone	Single Parent Support is a collection of scriptures that were carefully chosen to empower and challenge the single parent. The scriptures represented are meant to arm a single parent with a biblical support system. The last few pages of the book are presented in journal form. These pages are to be utilized by the reader to prepare a family mission statement, prayer and goals.<br />I feel the book could have been enhanced with the addition of short meditative moments. However, Jarmon has assembled a powerful set of scriptures to uplift the single parent.<br />Reviewed by Robilyn Heath<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28
Life in the Upper Echelons in Black Society	The Christmas Party is a short novel about murder in upper class America. Craig Akino is wealthy, arrogant and something of a curmudgeon. Akino is so ornery that every year at Christmas he gives a big party for all his family, employees and friends to atone for his bad behavior the rest of the year. Most years everybody takes it tongue-in-cheek. But this year he may have gone too far. It's up to a family friend and retired policeman, Marshall Edmonds, to solve the mystery since the police are happily looking at Nika, Craig's wife as a suspect.<br />The Christmas Party is an interesting look at life in the upper echelons of Black society. Davenport does an excellent job of creating a believable story of mayhem and murder among wealthy African Americans. There was room for more character development and the novel would have been longer if we had known just a bit more about each of the characters. In all, it was an enjoyable book.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28

Learning from Experience	A Woman of Experience tells the story of Janie as she journeys through life after high school graduation and evolves into Jane, a woman of experience.  After a bit of shocking news, Janie decides to move to London, find a job and live life on her own.  Upon arriving in England, she moves into a rooming house, finds a job, makes new friends, reconnects with old friends and finds herself in all sorts of interesting situations.  In addition, she meets up with Posy, an old classmate that is about to be married.  When Posy and Janie were in school, Janie was usually at the brunt of all of Posy's snobbish jokes and comments, but over the time the two develop a unique relationship.  Janie's love relationships add additional depth to the story line as well as some interesting twists in the plot.  The situations Janie finds herself in provide her with the experiences that help her transition from a naïve teenage girl into a woman trying to realize her dreams.<br />While this story starts off a little slow, it gradually picks up in intensity while drawing you into the story.  The author does a nice job of showing us how Jane's thoughts and feelings impact the choices she makes.  As Jane grapples with learning the difference between sex and love you see her grow in maturity and as a result, she is better able to relate to the other people in her life.  Her search for a meaningful relationship is one that many women will relate to.  Kay Gregory has written an enjoyable coming of age story that is sure to be enjoyed by many.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28
Leading a Saved Life	Niki decides that it is time for a change in her life and after praying for guidance decides to move with her three children to Zion, leaving her husband and extended family behind.  She feels stuck spiritually and believes that by moving to Zion and joining Way Maker Ministries, a church that she has until now only experienced through their television ministry, she can grow closer to God and live the life He has in store for her.  Niki steps out on faith and is indeed rewarded but not without some trials along the way.  Real Saved Folks tells the story of Niki and her children, as they adjust to the move to Zion, develop new relationships, and rebuild their lives.  The story addresses a variety of issues that Christians and all people deal with including marriage, divorce, friendship, parenting, and finding healthy, positive relationships with the opposite sex.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book but didn't feel like it ever really captured me.  More background on the lives of the characters before the events in the book would have made this a much more powerful read.  I felt the characters all seemed too perfect and could have been more well rounded.  Leading a Christian life doesn't mean that everything is easy and I felt like the characters made very serious and sometimes difficult decisions with too much ease.  However, the messages on faith, patience, and seeking God in your life were powerful and quite inspiring.  This story will motivate new Christians to deepen their relationship with God, while providing situations that more developed Christians can relate to.  I look forward to seeing the continued growth in Sonnie Beverly's future works.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28
In Love and War	Remember how boys used to tease the girls they had crushes on? Remember how girls would ignore the boys they were googly-eyed over?  If not, sit back while Charlie L. Russell recalls the games boys and girls play in The Worthy Ones.<br />  Mattie Johnson and James Pettaway are presented as two normal, passionate teens.  From Mattie's harsh reality of having to quit school to help her mother with taking in laundry to James' brother's car Lizzie, Russell steers us through the lives of these adolescents who really like each other, but aren't sure how to show it.  Instead of James wooing Mattie with his baseball swing, he takes another girl to the Juneteenth dance.  Instead of Mattie wowing James with her fancy cooking or new dress, she courts another man.<br />  The Worthy Ones takes us throughout the 1920's, 1930's, and 1940's only to transport us back to the Civil War era at the conclusion.  Adding history lessons throughout the coming of age of Mattie and James, their children, and, ultimately, their ancestors, the Worthy Ones is without a doubt, worthy of one's time.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28
What�s hair got to do with it?	The state of Martha's hair marks her journey through life. When she was in love with Elvis Presley, she tortured herself and her hair by slathering it with grease and hot combing the kinks out. She was shattered when her sister told her Elvis didn't even like black people. As she moved further into consciousness about being an African American, she wore the large Afro of the seventies. Later, in her professional life, as hair products got better and better, she opted for the silky smooth look of a chemical perm. She might even have taken it a scary step too far. Adam, the man in her life, loved it, which was a wake-up call for her.<br />Martha's journey through life was not as smooth or as easy as changing her hair. She met and soon became pregnant by Greg before she could get a good start in college. While never doubting that he loved her, she knew that he was a liar, scarred by his life under Jim Crow, beat down and insecure. The man she traded Greg in for was definitely not a blessing. Maybe Martha needed to stop trying to fix the outside and begin loving Martha.<br />Crowning Glory is an interesting look into how society teaches black women to wish they were anything but black. It is an eye-opener about the subtleties of life in America for African American women. It was an easy, pleasurable read and an interesting journey.<br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-28

And in author Peggy Eldridge-Love's You Beckon, she shares her gift for artistic expression, and her poetry works its way into reader's hearts.<br /> All of the poems in this collection are beautiful and they will inspire the reader to recall people, places and events that have shaped their lives. One poem that had a tremendous affect on me and moved me to tears is titled \\"My Father\\". Here Ms. Eldridge-Love expresses the sadness and disbelief that she felt as she watched her beloved father die. Having lost my father 10 years ago, I felt the author understood my pain and I was comforted. I highly recommend that everyone reads this wonderful book.	2003-01-24

Alvin Morrow outlines what he sees as the historical roots of the problems faced by Black families and what can be done to improve things.  His approach in the book is similar to that of the Socratic Method, wherein he illustrates and teaches many important points by raising a series of difficult questions.  While the book is not exhaustive, it goes a long way in terms of initiating a discussion of this very important issue.  Morrow includes a listing of additional resources the reader can use to obtain more thorough information on many of the topics he introduces.<br />The greatest asset of this book is that it causes the reader to think critically about some of the major issues influencing the Black family and the Black community as a whole.  He discusses an array of different issues including fatherhood, motherhood, religion, nutrition, and education.  Another asset of the book is that it moves beyond simply identifying problems by offering steps that should be taken to move towards solutions.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2003-01-24

But when Tyree's mother steps in, long buried Hightower family secrets start to surface that will threaten lives and possibly ruin Paris and Tyree's relationship.<br /> While this was a very interesting read, the story had one major shortfall which disrupted the flow of the book.

Depressing flashbacks	Rising opens with a disturbing flashback scene in the life of<br />eight-year-old Symone, the \\"biracial, blond-haired, blued-eyed\\"<br />only child of Dolores. Through descriptive narrative, colorful<br />imagery, and a wonderful collection of analogies, we see into<br />the mind of a young woman coming to grips with a childhood of<br />neglect. Ford gives us a moving narration of Symone's<br />experience living in the projects with her heroin addicted,<br />prostitute mother and then the dreadful death of her mother. At<br />this point, Symone is adopted by the Hudsons, a rich white<br />family in an affluent neighborhood far from the ghetto.<br />We are then immediately thrown into the present and the life of<br />Symone at age 27 and the rest of the novel takes place after<br />Symone receives an unwanted invitation for Thanksgiving dinner<br />with the family. We are given flashbacks into Symone's<br />childhood with the Hustons and the physical and emotional as<br />well as the sexual mistreatment received at the hands of her<br />adopted father, Ridge Huston. Based on some of the flashbacks,<br />I couldn't quite understand why Symone felt it necessary nor did<br />I find it realistic for her to accept the invitation. But she<br />does so and subjects herself to further pain...this is where the<br />novel takes a deep turn and I immediately jumped to conclusions<br />about the ending; some were correct while others were way off<br />base. These aspects of the ending both surprised and confused<br />me.<br />This novel started off toying with my emotions and I liked it<br />instantly, but by the middle and near end of the novel I felt a<br />bit left out. It was too neat, a little unrealistic (especially<br />the change in Symone's physical appearance) and sometimes too<br />descriptive. Additionally, I would've much preferred to hear the<br />story told as it happened versus the flashbacks told from the<br />older Symone. In spite of this, I felt sympathetic for Symone<br />as I would for any child suffering through unthinkable actions<br />of others. I encourage others to check this book out for<br />themselves. I had to go a step further.<br />I was fortunate to have purchased a copy of the self-published<br />version of this book when it was first released and read it a<br />few days after I finished reading the new version...and the<br />first thing that crossed my mind was a feeling of sadness that<br />the ending and so many other parts of the book were changed. I<br />was almost left speechless at the original ending (which was far<br />more realistic than the new version) and some of the other<br />portions of the book. Simply Amazing! If I could rate the self-<br />published version, it would be without a doubt a 5 rating!<br />Ford is a talented author who should definitely be watched as<br />she progresses in her literary endeavors.

Shaded by the vine	John Buddy Pearson's life got off to a rocky start.  His stepfather resented him for his light skin and the fact that another man's blood ran through his veins, and often picked fights with him.  John worked hard in the cotton fields on their sharecropping tract, but little could be done to please his stepfather.<br />John always longed to see what life was like &quot;on the other side of the tracks&quot;, so after a particularly serious brawl with his stepfather, he decided to go for it.  He moved across the bridge, where children went to school in their free time, and his real father, Alf Pearson, resided on his large plantation.  Alf encouraged John to attend the local colored school in his spare moments, and it was here that John first lay eyes on the smart and beautiful, albeit young, Lucy Potts. John, with his high yellow skin and godlike stature, was a favorite among the ladies on the Pearson estate. However, he cast their advances aside as he pined for Lucy.<br />John and Lucy eventually married and moved to Eatonville, Florida, a &quot;whole town uh nothing but colored folks&quot;, where John was called to preach the gospel, honing his already strong speaking skills.  John was still a favorite with the ladies, and in a position to do so, he strayed from the mores he was supposed to uphold and engaged in illicit affairs.  Thus begun the descension of our character, as his deviant ways became exposed and no longer shrouded in his notoriety.<br />Zora Neale Hurston's first novel, Jonah's Gourd Vine marks the beginning of a dazzling writer's craft.  Peppered with the southern dialect that Hurston is so well-known for, it was, at times, a bit unclear as to what the characters were saying. I found myself saying sentences, and even paragraphs, aloud to discern their meaning.  Lucy's character is particularly strong throughout the story. John's character, to me, represents both the &quot;good guy&quot; and later &quot;the bad guy,&quot; as I was taken through his struggles, comeupances, and downfalls.  I believe everyone should read Hurston, if only for her superb use of language and, in this case, biblical themes.

If you can't stand the heat...	It's in His Kiss is a warmly spun tale about the owner of<br />the Silver Spoon Cafe, Savannah Jacobs and the food critic<br />for the Cincinnati Tribune, Jackson Dewitt.<br />Jackson's article after his visit to the cafe was titled 'Gag<br />Me with a Spoon' and was punctuated with a one-and-a-half star<br />rating.  Savannah is livid, she has sank all of her savings into<br />this business and she knows an article of that magnitude could<br />be a few more nails in the coffin of the already struggling<br />restaurant.  With really no thought of consequences, Savannah<br />struts into Jackson's office and upends a hot dish on his desk.<br />Along with Jackson's mild case of shock as he scrambles to<br />clean up the spilled food, is a large case of piqued interest,<br />over the hot dish who just walked out of his office. As he sits and<br />ponders his next move, he wonders if this woman will respond to<br />anything coming from him.<br />Ms. Laudat, has managed to capture a funny ethnic romance about<br />two people with careers on their mind. Both are unsure if they're<br />ready for the heat they are generating in the kitchen, yet neither<br />wants to come out. The writer furbishes the reader with a humorus<br />romance that also highlights the presence of politics in the newspaper<br />publishing industry.  Really a 3.5...	2003-01-22
The beginnings of an innovative collection	Wine Me, Dine Me, Dance Me, Romance Me is a romantic collection of poetry that<br />evolves from three generational stages:  a look into the author's<br />relationships, these accounts as viewed by a fictional son, and descriptions<br />provided by that son's daughter.  The collection is definitely different than<br />most because it boasts three table of contents -- a traditional one; one<br />titled &quot;Musical Inspiration,&quot; in which the author attempts to tie his poetry to<br />selected R&amp;B songs; and another titled &quot;Photographic Images,&quot; where the author<br />intertwines his poetic words with visual images.<br />Gene S. Hewett's collection is innovative.  It is the first book of poetry I've<br />read that attempts to tie in several medium (visual, textual, aural) in book<br />form.  Gems in this collection include &quot;The Last Time I Saw Spring,&quot; &quot;You Make<br />Me Feel Brand New,&quot; and &quot;Traces of Love.&quot;  It is obvious that Hewett has a<br />romantic, loving flair to his writing; however, overall, the poetry as a whole<br />did not move me.  I found it hard to connect to the rhythms, the rhymes, and<br />the poetic elements that I enjoy reading in poetry.  I think this inability<br />came from the collision of media.  For me, a poem should evoke the visuals and<br />the aurals; I should not need aids to give me the full poetic experience.<br />In the book, Hewett states that he anticipates that the book can be presented<br />in audio book form; and in the long run, it could be packaged in a stage<br />production format, complete with speaker, background music, and Power Point<br />images -- with optional dance choreography.  With the high goals that Hewett<br />has for this collection, I could definitely see that the &quot;long run&quot; should be<br />the &quot;short run.&quot;  Wine Me, Dine Me, Dance Me, Romance Me could easily be a<br />CD &quot;book&quot;, packed with poetry, interlaced with musical interludes, and<br />completed with images and author comments about the poetry.<br />In book form, this collection is good; but as a multimedia project, it could be<br />great.<br />Reviewed by Shonie Baconith images and author comments about the poetry.<BR>In book form, this collection is good; but as a multimedia project, it could be <BR>great.<br />Reviewed by Shonie Bacon	2003-01-22

Great debut novel!	Focusing on the inner workings of a denomination, this novel was refreshingly different. As the newly appointed pastor of Greater Hope Gospel United Church, Theophilus Simmons has his hands full. Beginning with being haunted by his past indiscretions with the church vamp, meddlesome church members, prejudice within a race, greed, church politics and sexual misconduct, the young pastor must continue to persevere.<br />Essie Lee Lane is a juke joint cook. Her down-to-earth manner and attractive looks catch Theophilus' fancy. Theophilus courts Essie Lee and finally asks her to be his wife. As a young married couple, they are portrayed as having a healthy, nurturing relationship and strong familial ties of immediate and extended families, which is important for the many challenges they face.<br />The novel takes place in Memphis during the height of the Civil Rights movement. With the use of many secondary characters within the denomination and various church members of Greater Hope, Ms. Bowens carefully weaves many frailties of the human race the novel. These include sexual intrigue, abuse of power, church politics tainted by scandalous ways and worldly temptations, just to name a few! This book keeps it real.  While some of the situations portrayed in the novel could be unsettling to some; I felt these situations could be realistic regardless of the denomination.<br />The novel did start off a little slow, but once it got going, CHURCH FOLK was a real page-turner. Although based in the 1960's, the situations portrayed in CHURCH FOLK could very well ring true today! Overall, I thought this was a good read. It will definitely capture your attention!<br />Reviewed by Nedine Hunter<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22
Love, Life and College	Truth Be Told tells the story of Kahlila Bradford as she evolves through her second semester of college at Franklin University.  Kahlila is intelligent, beautiful and socially responsible.  She has several good friends-Robyn, Desiree, and JT, as well as a popular boyfriend, Tariq.  The only thing that Kahlila seems to be missing is passionate, unconditional love...then she meets Dave.<br />Dave Robinson is a Teacher Assistant for Kahlila's Black Collective Responsibility class. When the two are chosen to develop a summer program for underprivileged kids sparks fly and their connection is undeniable.  The only problem is Dave is already in a committed, long-term relationship.<br />Rachel Skerritt has written an excellent debut novel that accurately depicts college life and first love.  The characters are so well developed that by the end of the novel, they are like old friends.  The story was crisp and had several socially conscious sub-plots such as teenage pregnancy, race relations, interracial dating, labeling and stereotypes, loyalty, and giving back to the community.  This novel is so versatile that both teens and adults young and old can enjoy it.  I highly recommend this novel and look forward future works from this author.  I definitely hope a sequel is in the works.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22

Full Circle	A Twist of Fate by Beverly Clark is definitely an original, outstanding, and heartwarming novel which identifies intensely with its title. You never know what life has in store for you from day to day and Camille King and Nicholas Cardoneaux truly learned that a twist of fate dealt a very unique blow to their senses.  They meet for the first time at a fertility clinic and they are wondering why they have been summoned there to see the same doctor at the same time. Camille, who is now a widower, and Nicholas, who is now divorced, soon learn that they have quite a lot in common, and they leave the clinic with some very surprising and shocking news. It gets even better because Camille, who is African American can't believe the news; and Nicholas, who is white, is surprised as well which builds up to some interesting exchanges.<br />Now, the \\"twist of fate\\" begins when Camille struggles to accept the news and move on, however, Nicholas does not intend to let Camille move on without him. What escalates the plot of the story is Nicholas' mother who has her own agenda and skeletons.<br />Nicholas and Camille knock heads more then once, until reality and a strong bonding of love becomes the loving connection that sets the stage for more drama and decisions. This is nice page-turner and the surprise ending is very fitting for the twist and characters that Beverly so eloquently developed in the storyline.<br />Ms. Clark outdid herself in writing a very touching novel of medical mistakes that have a way of turning everyone's emotions around.  It touches on the reality of people wanting to be accepted for something that they are not and on how they will go to any length to get or keep that acceptance. You will truly enjoy this book. I was not disappointed, and neither will you.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22
He's back!	Alex Cross is on the verge of resigning from the D.C. police<br />when childhood buddy and partner, John Sampson comes to him for<br />assistance. Sampson's friend has been framed and accused of<br />killing three Army wives on an Army Post, so Alex and Sampson<br />set out to prove he's been set up.  In their research, they're<br />faced with the brick wall of silence and lack of cooperation<br />from the military, numerous similar murders, and they even end<br />up the targets of the military trained killers.<br />In this book, we're immediately told who the killers are, but in<br />true James Patterson fashion, we're left sitting on the edge of<br />our seats as we learn why they're killing, leaving clues behind<br />and painting the bodies red, white or blue.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt the suspense was<br />masterfully drawn in a manner that encourages you to continue<br />reading until the last sentence.  Unlike the previous Alex Cross<br />books, this one gave us more of a look inside the lives of<br />Sampson and Nana Mama and that coupled with the suspense puts<br />this at the top of my reading list for 2002.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Back to Life	Ina has a twelve year marriage, the luxury of staying home to care for her three beautiful children, and a home that most people only see in magazines, yet happiness is just outside her grasp.  When her husband announces that he is leaving, she is shocked and a little surprised that he was the one doing the leaving.  All her life, Ina struggled to find a level of comfort with who she really was.  Once she married Jay, an enterprising and hardworking owner of a real estate firm, her search for self fades into the background and eventually she becomes consumed by her life as a wife and mother and loses herself.  After a difficult childhood, Jay dreams of having the perfect family, the perfect home, and enough money to enjoy all the comforts the world has to offer.  But what is Ina's dream and is Jay's dream enough?  Now that Jay has left, Ina is forced to explore her past, come to terms with her present, and plan for the future.  Will she find herself along the way?  Is the marriage really over?<br />Benilde Little's latest novel demonstrates that she is still at the top of her game.  Through Ina's character, we experience pain, insecurities, and the rich cultural legacy that are common parts of the lives of African American women. We learn the importance of accepting ourselves and others for whom and what we are, through Ina's experiences after her husband's departure.  While this book is focused on Ina rebuilding her life, it is also about her self-discovery.  The supporting characters in the book are diverse and add additional complexity to the story line.  One of the book's messages, that you should never get so caught up in the dreams of others that you forget your own, will surely tug at your heartstrings.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22

She was loved by her students and highly sought after for help by the sisters of her church. She also had the perfect husband, pediatrician Matthew Dresden and together they were the \\"ideal couple\\".  For years, she literally outshined her younger sister Stacy, who always stood in the background as the one who didn't have it completely together.<br />Even though Rikki seemed to have the perfect life, deep down she was deeply troubled by many issues. From the earliest stages of her childhood, she struggled mentally and emotionally and this continued throughout her adult life. While others speculated, Stacy was left to carry the burden behind Rikki's problems. Although for years, the family wore a mask of secrecy, when Matthew later disappears, the image that was so carefully guarded immediately crashes down.<br />Although this was her debut novel, Mrs. Hall writes with the skill of a veteran in the literary world. From beginning to end, she takes readers on a journey of an African-American family who is impacted by the effects of mental illness. She writes with a power and an insight that makes you believe that you are truly witnessing it from afar.

By her side is her precious<br />daughter Tara, who in my mind carried the story--she is<br />definitely a character I'll always remember.  Tara's innocence and instant liking to the brothers,<br />in particular Telford, made me long for family and friends.  It<br />is through her character that I saw the true meaning of love.<br />Meanwhile, Alexis and Telford share not only feelings for each<br />other, but Alexis is keeping a secret from him that could affect<br />their new found love while in the background her ex-husband pops<br />up starting his own brand of drama.<br />This is a cute story with all the ingredients of a nice romance<br />novel, however I felt the big &quot;secret&quot; was not really a big deal<br />and I didn't care for the ending.  In spite of this, I did love<br />most of the characters and their different voices.  I am not<br />sure if a follow-up book is in the plans, but I'd love to read<br />more about little Tara and also what happens with Alexis's<br />sister and the Harrington brother.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Finding your way out	Waiting to Exit Hell is an intense thought provoking title that may<br />have readers contemplating whether this book is about an escape from<br />a fiery here after or from the hell we can often find ourselves in,<br />here on earth. What I think readers will experience is the author's<br />message which is clearly about freeing one's self from the sins of<br />the flesh and forming an allegiance of love and devotion to God.<br /><br />Gloria \\"Babi\\" Robinson has been teetering on the brink of hell most<br />of her young life. Even though life's circumstances have her entering<br />into adulthood before her time, she realizes that if she's to find<br />strength to survive she is going to need God's help.  She does find<br />the Lord, but this anointing lasts only until she's eighteen when<br />other life forces intervene. Babi meets, Leonard Atwater, who is<br />probably the final push into the hell that she has struggled to allude<br />all this time. It is at this point that she does a 180 degree turn from<br />God, and for the next several years she experiences every negative<br />vice imaginable. As her life continues to spiral downward, she feels<br />God is punishing her for turning her back on his teachings. There is<br />a wake up call that has her looking deep into how she is living each<br />day. Babi knows she has two choices; change her life or face her<br />eternity, but does she have the strength to make the right decision?<br />Waiting To Exit Hell is meant to awaken the spiritual consciousness<br />that is too often denied or left buried in one's life. But I don't<br />know if that message will be clear to readers.  The book veers off<br />in several different directions, there are too many un-connected<br />stories and at times the focus of the story seems unclear. However,<br />Ms. Rolyat in this unveiled look at religious reconstruction boldly<br />exposes the dangers and consequences of sexual immorality.

A Common Sense Guide for Finding Mr. Right	Trophy Man is an interesting read where the author has interviewed women from all walks of life who have married \\"well\\" in an attempt to uncover what their &quot;secrets&quot; are. The book is a compilation of the views and advice that the women have for others who are having difficulties snagging a &quot;trophy man.&quot; The book gives general, common sense advice for meeting and keeping a man.<br />McElroy's major theme throughout the book is to know yourself and what your needs and wants are before searching for a mate. The book also has etiquette tips for dating, meeting possible in-laws, etc. In addition  a list of several prominent African American events are given where professionals are able to meet and socialize.<br />I was impressed with the way the author shows that a &quot;trophy man&quot; is not just a man who has money and prestige, but a man who has a loving heart.

As Joan<br />gradually lets Majad in, she begins to distrust his love; unsure<br />whether he is sincere or false in his intentions. From the very<br />beginning, their relationship is a journey containing many twists and<br />turns.<br />While the letters in Clear Skinned provide insight into Joan and<br />Majad's relationship, the story falls short by leaving many questions<br />unanswered. Although it is clear that Joan and Majad were pretty<br />intense, the unanswered questions made the overall story incomplete.<br />Clear Skinned has the potential of being a great story, however it<br />would be better suited as a full length novel than a series of<br />letters.<br />Reviewed by Kanika (Nika) Wade<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22
Quick paced mystery!	Looking for a quick paced mystery to get your mind running as you try to figure out whodunit?  Well, Dog 'Em: A Mick Hart Mystery, fits the bill and goes the extra distance to take you into the world of Mick Hart, private investigator! It also throws in a measure of drama and romance to give it an extra twist and provide wider audience appeal.<br />Mick Hart can't win for losing.  When he goes against the rules and bends the rules for a single mom to help her find the father of her child, he loses his job.  We then take on a journey through one of Mick's cases in which he's hired to find Amanda Monroe, reported missing by her grandmother, and using his first tactic of checking the city morgues, he comes up empty handed...well, almost empty handed.  Instead of finding her, he finds two corpses with similar injuries and then finds Amanda in the hospital in a coma with the same injuries.  The plot thickens when he finds out that all the women know each other and are members of the Sisters of Empowering and Learning Book Club.<br />Their last read was How to Train the Dog in Your Black Men so perhaps that has someone feeling a bit threatened, challenged, and ridiculed by women across the country. Many women are picking it up and trying to put its principles to practice at the risk of becoming the next victim. And the serial killer is on a rampage trying to redeem himself. He's [upset] and tired of being the one dogged.<br />Christopher has brilliantly penned a novel that is poignant and revealing, just as it is suspenseful and intriguing.  I read this book in under two hours and my only disappointment was that it was over.  I look forward to the next installment in the Mick Hart series and would highly recommend this book.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22

Romance meets mystery...	Shereen, Yolanda, Ellie, and Jessica are best friends, known as the Fabulous Four after pledging Theta Phi Kappa at Howard University. The book takes us a decade past their college experience and expertly crafts in moments of flashbacks.  In her novel, Perrin distinctively details the bonds of friendship with well-rounded, well developed and real characters and spins the lesson of forgiveness and moving on with life.<br />In their adult lives, each woman is successful and they've kept their ties to each other but once trouble comes knocking, they stick beside each other forming a bond that helps them deal with their problems.  After meeting up, one of them does something totally unthinkable, shattering the world of another one that starts a myriad of chaos between the friends.  In addition, another starts receiving threatening calls that place her in the position to lose all she's worked for if the secret the four women are hiding becomes public knowledge. The author successfully uses flashbacks to share the secret they shared during their college years and the effects it had on each of them.<br />This book is fast-paced and a wonderful read.  My only problem with the book was the ending.  It seemed a bit unrealistic and over the top, nonetheless I enjoyed the story and commend Ms. Perrin for doing a wonderful job melding together the genres of mystery, drama, and romance.  This would make an excellent book for discussion and for highlighting sisterhood and friendship.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22

Things between them<br />seem to be going great, until Isaiah discovers what she is really like.<br />Justine is a beautiful woman with a lot of ugly secrets. She appears to<br />be a normal person, who is capable of handling whatever life throws her<br />way, but this is far from the truth. When Isaiah's attention focuses<br />towards his business and not her, she begins to lose control, and<br />decides that if she can't have Isaiah no one will.<br /> The Kiss Of Judas by Renee Allen is a really good book with a gripping<br />and suspenseful storyline.

Life is just a fantasy	Sometimes our dreams can be so vivid, the ability to discern them from real life becomes difficult.  For Demeter Pickens, it becomes a near impossibility.<br />Breaux's sophomore effort, Imaginary Playmate, provides an intertesting twist to the art of dreaming.<br />The name Dr. Pickens may be familiar to those who have read her debut, A Family Curse, and this name returns more prominently in Imaginary Playmate. Demeter Pickens, the doctor's daughter, finds herself teetering on the edge of a dream world and reality.  Plagued by the memories she can't conjure and narcoleptic fits of phantasm, Demeter believes at first that she is having a lucid dreaming experience that she can no longer control. In her dreams she is visited by her imaginary playmate, Marcello, and he becomes larger than life when he walks her through the halls of her innermost desires.<br />Imaginary Playmate is an intense look into the unknown realms of time, dreams, memories, and the universe as a whole. Filled with erotic love scenes and underlying themes of forgiveness, this was an enthralling read.  I love Breaux's look into the supernatural, and enjoy the way she weaves her tales, intermingling her characters' existences. With a touch more editorial polishing to tighten up the sequence of events and minor grammatical errors, this would have been a five star book. I am looking forward to the next installment of this series (which is hinted at within the text of Imaginary Playmate).<br />Reviewed by CandaceK<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-22
Who is responsible for the lynching?	In the town of Walton County, Georgia a mass lynching took place on the eve of July 25, 1946. Four victims were found shot to death at Moore's Ford Bridge and for five decades the person or persons responsible for the mass lynching have remained a mystery. This book chronicles the shocking story of the events that took place on that tragic day and the aftermath, which continues to the present day.<br />The FBI was called in to conduct an investigation into the deaths of the four victims. Black people were shocked and feared for their own lives so when questioned by the agents, they did not tell what they knew. Whites on the other hand had alibis for the day in question and pretended not to know anything about the lynching. After four months of intense investigations the case was still unsolved. Can you imagine what affect this mass lynching had on the people of the United States? To this very day no one has been convicted.<br />Laura Wexler, a young writer, became interested in this in 1997; she did an excellent job in her presentation of this tragic story. After extensive research into FBI data she conducted over one hundred interviews with people in Walton County, Georgia related to the lynchings. Her descriptive writing gives us the full story of the events that occurred during that tragic time in history.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood<br />The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-01-16

Paige takes on the role of guardian, and the two form a bond that is unbreakable.<br />The girls soon meet friends who love to hang out at their apartment without adult supervision.

Their once close-knit clique of friends begin to find themselves drifting apart as some members become involved in the lucrative, albeit dangerous, drug game.  Pinch and Paige find themselves questioning everything that they once held sacred including their bond to each other.<br />Danyel Smith has written a wonderful, engrossing novel. The characters are well developed and have so much history with each other. The story reads smoothly and her use of flashbacks and diary entries helps the reader gain insight into past situations, helps with understanding the characters actions, and provides insight into their psyches. Her vivid descriptions made me feel as though I was in Oakland and that I personally knew all of the characters. I definitely recommend this book and eagerly anticipate future works from this author.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy	2003-01-15
Chasing a Dream	Forestine and Viola are two women with very different lives but similar dreams. Forestine grows up in Brooklyn, in a home she feels less than welcome in, with a dream to one day become a singer. As Forestine grows older, her dream to become a singer is her only true passion, quite often at high costs. Viola is raised in the country, the daughter of a preacher and his \\"proper\\" wife, she is less sure of what she wants out of life but knows she will have a hard time finding it in the small constrictive town in which she was raised. Miss Honeybee was from the same small town, Jasperville, North Carolina that Viola is from but made her escape to New York City where she built a life for herself that the people in Jasperville talk about in hushed voices. Honeybee's \\"gathers\\" have become notorious as a time where there is good food and good music come together, almost any musician of any merit has passed through Honeybee's home at some point to take part in a \\"gather\\". Through Honeybee both women overcome heartbreak, find healing and ultimately discover themselves.<br />This tremendous story will take you back to a time where jazz was in full swing, and carry you through to a time when the music form became overshadowed by its more contemporary counterparts. While you are immersed in a world of music, you are also drawn into the lives of the characters as they experience, heartbreak, love, sadness and happiness. Andrea Smith's eloquent writing, gives the story just the right literary flair to keep you engrossed in the world of gathers and gigs, taking you back to another time. Emotions run high in the story and as you become more drawn into the story; you can't help but experience the ups and downs right along with the characters. Saying I highly recommend this book would be an understatement, it will no doubt be one of the best reads of the year.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2003-01-15
Words of Wisdom	William W. Tucker was a man who after dedicating his life to Christ at 17 spent his time doing the work of God.  Simply by reading author Frederick Cuthbertson's heartfelt words and descriptions of Bishop Tucker it becomes abundantly clear that he had a tremendous impact on the lives of those he came in contact with.  This book includes a brief biography of Bishop Tucker, but the true depth of the book comes from the collection of over 150 of his sayings.  While Bishop Tucker may not have originated all of the sayings, he applied his wisdom and Biblical knowledge to the context in which they were used.  The book lists the various sayings, includes a brief description of the context in which they were used and citations of Biblical references which relate to the sayings.  For example the saying \\"Rake the word to yourself and don't use a shovel\\" suggests that the word of God is meant for our hearts and not meant to be cast away when it condemns us for our misdeeds.<br />With the well over 150 sayings included in this book, there is advice that is relevant to any person at any given point in their lives.  More importantly, the book's easy to remember sayings, when taken to heart, will help any Christian walk closer to God.  The only disappointment about this book was it's organization, it would have been a much more powerful day to day resource for Christians had the various sayings been organized by theme so that they are easier to locate.  Still The \\"Sayings\\" of the Late Bishop William W. Tucker is both inspirational and motivational.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2003-01-05
All Things Are Possible	I've Gotta Tell Somebody is the true story of Erline Dennis' walk with Christ. Dennis tells of how her friend Pat, to whom the book is also dedicated, helped her develop a close relationship with GOD. In trying times such as the death of her mother, as well as going through surgery, Dennis tells of how Pat is her rock, her strength but most importantly her friend.

Dennis shares with us how she never in a million years thought she could write poetry. GOD showed her that it is something HE wanted her to do. And as an obedient child of GOD, she didn't second guess just obeyed her Father. Her gift was made public to the world in her first book, I Heard You, Lord.<br />I've Gotta Tell Somebody is an inspiring look at what the LORD can do for you if only you believe. Reading this book gives you a closer look at what GOD is capable of instilling in your lives no matter what YOU think you can or can't do. A truly uplifting book I would definitely recommend to others.<br />Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinnin	2003-01-02

Upon her arrival she stumbles upon Jamal Ari Yassir, a prince from the Middle Eastern country of Tahran.

A Personal Journey	I Just Want To Testify is Laurie Hunter-Gilbert's autobiography,<br />and in it she shares how her life was affected because she fell in<br />love with a man who was licensed to someone else. With much bravery,<br />Ms. Hunter-Gilbert allows a look inside her soul as she recounts the<br />painful existence she endured when she fell blindly into the pit,<br />whose danger seems hidden from so many women.<br />Addiction is not always a substance that is introduced into the<br />physical body; addiction also resides in the mind. And warnings and<br />logical assessments by others will not be openly embraced by the<br />victim, because they are too close to the struggle. It brings to<br />mind the analogy, 'can't see the forest for the trees'. This fact<br />is evident when Laurie resists all advice and fights alone to<br />conquer what she has yet to acknowledge is an addiction. Yet, credit<br />must be given because she tries to define herself apart from and in<br />spite of all the relationships that engulfed her throughout her life.<br />Ms. Hunter-Gilbert offers encouragement to the reader that mistakes<br />are merely lessons learned, which allow you to grow. I applaud her<br />and the courage it took to share this personal journey through her<br />pain, growth, healing and self-renewal. This is a wonderful read,<br />very empathetic and very emotional.

Great debut novel!	Focusing on the inner workings of a denomination, this novel was refreshingly different. As the newly appointed pastor of Greater Hope Gospel United Church, Theophilus Simmons has his hands full. Beginning with being haunted by his past indiscretions with the church vamp, meddlesome church members, prejudice within a race, greed, church politics and sexual misconduct, the young pastor must continue to persevere. <br />Essie Lee Lane is a juke joint cook. Her down-to-earth manner and attractive looks catch Theophilus' fancy. Theophilus courts Essie Lee and finally asks her to be his wife. As a young married couple, they are portrayed as having a healthy, nurturing relationship and strong familial ties of immediate and extended families, which is important for the many challenges they face. <br />The novel takes place in Memphis during the height of the Civil Rights movement. With the use of many secondary characters within the denomination and various church members of Greater Hope, Ms. Bowens carefully weaves many frailties of the human race the novel. These include sexual intrigue, abuse of power, church politics tainted by scandalous ways and worldly temptations, just to name a few! This book keeps it real.  While some of the situations portrayed in the novel could be unsettling to some; I felt these situations could be realistic regardless of the denomination. <br />The novel did start off a little slow, but once it got going, CHURCH FOLK was a real page-turner. Although based in the 1960's, the situations portrayed in CHURCH FOLK could very well ring true today! Overall, I thought this was a good read. It will definitely capture your attention! <br />Reviewed by Nedine Hunter	2003-01-02

Each chapter of the book covers an important emotional lesson, Anderson uses her own life to illustrate a problem and then uses Biblical text to shed light on the lesson she learned.  The chapters conclude with a scripture reading and a prayer.<br />I highly recommend this book because of the variety of subject matter it covers including, relationships with God, parents, children, friends, spouses, and coworkers.  Indeed, it has something for everyone.  While the format of the book was confusing at times because the experiences were not always presented chronologically, it was still a pleasure to read.  Stanice Anderson has truly been blessed and her candor and willingness to share her testimony will be an inspiration for anyone who reads this book.	2003-01-01
Major is definitely worthy!	If I had to pick one word to describe Marcus Major's new book, A Man Most<br />Worthy, it would be WONDERFUL...in all caps!!  Major has been a favorite of<br />mine since he first entered the literary scene with Good Peoples and now, quite<br />simply, I'm HOOKED; again...all caps!<br />36-year-old John Sebastian is a successful, well-known millionaire who has it<br />all; including a beautiful young girlfriend.  In spite of al this, he's missing<br />out on true love.  The one that got away seven years before is Josephine<br />Prescott.  She's the vice-principal of an elementary school in his old<br />neighborhood, married, and a bit overweight and often overlooked by her<br />husband.  He's the superintendent of a rich school district, overbearing, and<br />only concerned with himself and getting Josephine into his school district;<br />mainly because he's concerned about what his peers think of her working in a<br />poor neighborhood.<br />Added to this ensemble of characters we have Jules, John's best friend and Mr.<br />Duke, who took a large part in raising both men.  Once John decides to start a<br />new branch in his old hometown, Mr. Duke suggests that John give back to his<br />community by mentoring some of the underprivileged students in his old<br />neighborhood.  Unbeknownst to John, Mr. Duke purposely selects Josephine's<br />school as the beneficiary and a whirlwind of activities follow suit when<br />Josephine comes face to face with John.<br />I loved this book and Major's ability to so easily depict the thoughts of his<br />characters, especially the female ones through some of the most emotional times<br />of their lives.  As Josephine goes through dealing with her past with John, the<br />pains he inflicted on her, as well as her current weight gain and the new pain<br />her husband doles out, I felt moved and linked to them.  It felt as if I had<br />personally shared her trials and tribulations with her, as if I were her best<br />friend helping her get through them...just as I would one of my own<br />girlfriends.  Additionally, seeing John's desire to right the wrongs done so<br />long ago and prove himself worthy were also a great addition to the story.  Did<br />I say I loved this book?  I felt it and connected with the characters.<br />As with his previous works, Major's writing style remains crisp,<br />witty, emotional, insightful and thoroughly captivating!  The<br />subplots even had me drawn into the story as I cheered the<br />characters on and took part in their everyday lives.  This is a<br />book that teaches a lesson of true friendship, forgiveness, and<br />making the best out of the decisions we've made in our lives.<br />To close...check this one out for yourself and determine just as<br />I did that Major is just as worthy as his characters for all<br />praise bestowed upon him for this novel.

On the verge of insanity or well over the edge?	Hardly ever am I left not knowing where to begin detailing my feelings about a book, but The Ecstatic has left me on a one way street, yet I'm still not sure which way to proceed.  Victor LaValle introduces us to 318 pound Anthony James and the affects of schizophrenia on him and those in his family which consist of his mom, young sister, and grandmother, all of whom also suffer from the same illness.  We are taken through the whirlwind of Anthony's mind as he gives us accounts of various activities from a road trip for his sister to participate in a pageant for virgins, to seeing his Mom (who no longer recognizes him) leave with an unknown Indian man, to watching an auditorium of screaming people and protesters, to trying to help his friend through a bout of botulism.<br />The book continues in this fashion and as soon as you're drawn into Anthony's current escapade and what's happening to him and around him, LaValle takes a quick turn at the nearest intersection, so all you can do is regroup and get ready for Anthony's next journey.  Odds are that Anthony will be the catalyst of something going terribly wrong, yet I'm not quite sure he understood his part or all the drama around him.  He appears to be an innocent observer, even to himself, but it's obvious the part that he has in all the mayhem, more often than not, he's the cause.  I wasn't quite sure whether I liked Anthony or simply felt sorry for him, but I did understand him somewhat as he did his best to stay ahead of his illness.<br />The best way for me to describe this book would be to call it &quot;interesting and different.&quot;  The writing style is witty and compelling, yet at times, it's also confusing; especially the dialogue portions of the book.  Perhaps this is intentional as we share Anthony's descent from sanity, however I wasn't quite sure.  It's a book in which you're forced to pay attention, to read slowly, and block out all outside interference.  It would make a great book for discussion as well as one to give you a peek inside of the mind of a mentally unstable person.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Friends Forever	Caressa, Sharmayne, Rayne and Jade are four very confident and beautiful women who have been friends for a long time. While they each have their own issues and secrets, they are always there for each other. But more than anything else,  each of them yearns for unconditional love and happiness with their significant other.<br /> In Roxann Latimer's You Never Know, we take an emotional journey of love and discovery with these four wonderful women that runs the gamut of emotions. As a reader you want these women to work through their problems and find true happiness. Overall, I enjoyed You Never Know. However, I felt that the lack of explanation of certain events , and the transitions from one character to another seemed a little rushed and hurt the storyline somewhat. Despite these two issues I believe Ms. Latimer has a good writing voice and I look forward to reading more of her work.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2003-01-01
Poetic Story of Resilience	A Little Piece of Sky tells the story of Song Byrd.  Song takes a cautious look back over her life, starting with her earliest relationships and in doing so we read a story of triumph.  Song deals with an emotionally unavailable mother and later she struggles with the guilt she feels as a result of her mother's death.  When her mother dies, she has to live with her father and his wife and adjust to a completely new, but healthier existence.  Unfortunately, the scars of the early part of her life don't just disappear and her half sister and brother are additional reminders of the life she left behind. Even as an adult, Song continues to try to heal her wounds and make a life for herself and recover her lost self esteem.  The sky is an important theme in this book and it represents hope.  As Song shares her story it becomes clear that just a little bit of hope is often enough to carry a person through the most difficult circumstances.<br />Nicole Bailey-Williams has made a grand entrance into the literary scene with this spectacular novel.  She does an excellent job drawing the reader into Song's world and making them share in her experiences through the short passages of prose.  While the format of this book is different from the norm, the author's mixture of literary style and prose proved to be just the right recipe for a stellar debut.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2003-01-01
A Trail of Murder	Entertainment agent Kim Carlyle is flying high when one of her clients, internationally known singer Tiffany Jones, is on the comeback trail. Unfortunately, that comeback comes to a screeching halt one hot summer night in New York City. Instead of making a scheduled performance at the world famous Apollo Theatre. Tiffany Jones is making an appearance at the city morgue, with a toe tag as her most distinctive accessory.<br /> Tiffany's death sets the music world abuzz because something just does not seem quite right about her death. Kim believes her client has been murdered and is prepared to let the police handle the investigation. When another of her clients is murdered, she has to get involved, Kim is a former New York City police officer, so investigating crimes is like breathing to her. As Kim digs into her investigation, she uncovers a trail of dead bodies with an international connection.<br /> Who Killed Tiffany Jones is a suspense filled mystery that will keep readers on their toes. It also has a unique twist; instead of providing readers with the solutions to the crimes, the book provides the reader with the opportunity to solve the murders and the chance to win $10,000 if the reader comes up with the correct solution. If you had any doubts about reading this novel, cast them aside, reading Who Killed Tiffany Jones might pay off.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2003-01-01
Various definitions of erotica	What exactly is erotica?  This is the first question that popped into my head as I began reading After Hours and continued running through my mind as I delved further into my reading.  Robert Fleming has introduced us to a collection of short stories by some of the hottest African American male authors on today's literary scene in which they share their take on erotica.  Intially, my mind was focused on mind-boggling, soul-stirring, toes-curling stories of love, romance, and sex; but this book opened my eyes to the gamut of levels of erotica.  Icing on the cake was the fact that it comes directly from our black men; what they want and consider sensual and erotic.<br />From the humorous stories that tickled my funny bone to the ones that sent shivers of delight through my body and on to those that heated up my imagination and played with my senses, I was lost in a world of delightful storytelling.  I visited with men willing to completely let go as in Earl Sewell's \\"Rock Me Baby,\\" saw glimpses of men ready to give everything up to please their women as in Brian Egeston's humorous story \\"Wallbanging\\" and even saw a married man with a secret admirer who isn't quite sure how hot the \\"Cayenne\\" can be (written by Eric Pete)--one of my favorites of the bunch; especially the sentence...\\"Come kill this.\\"<br />Fleming has done a wonderful job compiling these 19 stories to present this collection and done so in a manner that is not demeaning to either women or men or to the actual theme of erotica. I will admit that I would've liked things a bit steamier in a few of the stories (to fit my own personal definition of erotica), but as a collection, the stories were wonderful.  It was also fitting in that we each see erotica on many different levels; seeing it from a man's point of view definitely makes it even better and dispels the stereotype that men don't share their emotions or their vulnerbilities.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

We�ve arrived�or have we?	PG County is a book that reveals how the lives of people living in a small geographical area can be very different.  It is a story of \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\" and portrays two very different perspectives on African American life.  Through the course of a series of events, the lives of these very different characters almost explosively intersect.<br />Barbara Bentley has it all, or so it seems from the outside.  She lives in one of the nicest homes in an affluent area of PG County and is preparing for her daughter's wedding.  However, she is struggling to maintain her sobriety while dealing with a marriage that is falling apart.  Jolene works day and night to keep up with the elite of PG County but her husband seems to have different priorities.  Jolene's ongoing struggle to keep up with the \\"haves\\" along with her general selfish attitude, are beginning to put a strain on her marriage.  Pearl has worked hard all of her life.  After years of struggling to raise her son on her own, he is finally grown and she has been able to realize her dream of owning a hair salon.  Candice is a liberal minded White woman who has always taught her children to be colorblind.  But when she learns that her daughter is in a relationship with a Black man, her liberal views and indeed her own identity come into question.  Finally there is Lee, a young teenage girl who has taken all the abuse she can handle from her mother's boyfriend.  As she flees from this awful existence, she begins the search for the father she doesn't know but dreams about.<br />Connie Briscoe has done it again with her most recent tale which reminds us all that \\"all that glitters is not gold.\\"  With lots of secrets divulged and plenty of twists and turns in the plot, this is a book that is hard to put down.  Strong character development helps the reader relate to and feel for even the most despicable characters in this book.  The passion, drama, and heartfelt emotion will quickly draw readers into the lives of the characters of this enjoyable book.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seayracters of this enjoyable book.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2003-01-01
The Fever of Life...	In a powerful dose of the issues surrounding marriage and friendship along with the problems, joys, and sacrifices that go along with them,  Linda Dominique Grosvenor gives us FEVER, the sequel to her second novel, Like Boogie on Tuesday.  In this follow-up book we see again how a person's past can have an effect on their present and future as well as how those incidents can put a claim on one's outlook on life and what they see reflecting back at them when looking through the mirror of life, the truth of one's situation, and the realization of why you're at a certain point in your life.  Grosvenor gives us five characters who are tied to each other through friendship, love, and familial strings.<br />Nina and Tim are married and should be living happily ever after.  However, Tim is consumed with becoming a top notch filmmaker and has a one-track mind that only focuses on his love of the industry.  This  leaves him wondering if marriage is what he initially thought it would be.  Then we have Nina...instead of being the glowing newlywed, Nina has given up her job in NY to follow Tim to Hollywood only to be neglected and left speculating on what Tim is really up to when he says he's working.  At the same time she is wondering what has happened to her individuality, her zeal for life and her emotional and physical being.  They both fail to effectively communicate their desires and needs to one another and an old lover from Tim's past pops up at an inopportune time, causing Nina to hightail it back to Brooklyn.<br />Sam and Carla are having problems of their own which also border on a lack of communication.  Carla is in her own world harboring a secret from her husband and has locked him out of her personal space.  Sam loves his wife, but isn't getting any of the patience and understanding that he's given her; not to mention the intimacy that should be abundant in a marriage.  The intimacy he desires from another woman puts what's left of  his marriage on shaky ground.  Nina's sister Troi, who is also Carla's best friend and Sam's sister-in-law, is holding strong after her own bouts with marital problems and exudes an aura of strength, an attitude focused on being positive, and the determination to make the best of her life and that of her family.  When Sam turns to her for advice and comfort, the similarities they find are a bit uncanny and predictable. In spite of this, how they handle things melded together with Carla's big secret leads them all on a crash course with life.<br />Grosvenor gives us a fast paced follow-up novel with three dimensional characters and a storyline worth delving into. This sequel does what all sequels should:  it realistically catches you up with the lives of all the characters and introduces others as necessary, it moves forward in a way that is appealing to the reader, and it keeps you involved with each character individually as well as collectively.  It is also written in a manner that smoothly transitions from one couple to the other using Troi as the common thread, giving us all five sides to the story.  Told in a mixture of narrative, dialogue, and descriptive prose, we're able to see clearly into the lives of each character as they go through the \\"fever\\" of their lives.  I highly recommend this novel and look forward to Grosvenor's next book.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal.

The voice of a preeminent poet	\\"Quilting is a metaphor for space travel and the Black folk<br />that I imagine await on us on Mars, sitting around quilting<br />the black - eyed pea.\\" -- Nikki Giovanni<br />In light of the quote above, I begin the arduous task of<br />reviewing the works of a cultural icon who has remained<br />unwaverved in her political beliefs and true to living<br />life her way. She has mastered the art of blending grief,<br />sarcasm and sometimes outrage with the right touch of<br />humor.<br />Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea, is a collection of 50 poems,<br />sketches and meditations that touches on a gamut of events<br />as Ms. Giovanni in her narrative voice gives the world a<br />historical overview and also focuses on the future. This<br />collection which cuts to the core and seems unapologetic<br />is very intimate. Each piece in the collection has the<br />ability to pull the reader into a vortex of introspection.<br />I urge everyone to read them slowly and absorb the author's<br />message.<br />In 'We're Going to Mars' and 'Symphony of the Sphinx', she<br />exposes sketches of Black history and the intense struggle<br />people of color have endured just to live the American dream.<br />In 'Here's to Gwen', Ms. Giovanni depicts women as  forces<br />to be reckoned with in literary history with her special<br />dedication to the premier poet, Gwendolyn Brooks. In 'Twenty<br />Reasons to Love Richard Williams', she pays homage to a<br />tennis father who had the stick-to-itiveness to propel his<br />daughters to tennis stardom, and who made the world see<br />through his eyes how beautiful Black is. There is nothing<br />quite like her terse, biting '9-11-01'('He blew it'), as<br />Ms. Giovanni shares her views on the politics of the country,<br />and on the office of the Commander and Chief. A meditative<br />'My America',(for Hugh Downs) is a quiet, calm piece where<br />the hope for something better is the message. Ms. Giovanni's<br />life altering illness emphasizing how fragile life is was<br />very evident in her poignant letter to 'Emerson Edward Rudd',<br />prior to his execution in Huntsville, Texas on November 15,<br />2001 for the armed robbery and murder of a restaurant manager.<br />In her final poem, 'The Song of the Feet,' she humorously<br />reflects on how the feet of women have been and will continue<br />to be a cornerstone in the development of Black History as<br />well as American History.<br />Ms. Giovanni is a poet, activist, mother, the author of 27<br />books, and a distinguished Professor of English at Virginia<br />Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, VA. In 1999 she was one of<br />14 living writers inducted into The Literary Hall of Fame for<br />writers of African Descent.

Selfish!	Tamara Hightower is a beautiful and hardworking woman who wants ths best out of life. She wears only the finest clothes and she pampers herself whenever possible. On the surface Tamara appears to be superficial, selfish and materialistic. But appearances can be deceiving, because Tamara is none of these things. She is just a woman searching for happiness and acceptance. Because she grew up without a father, Tamara is constantly looking for a father figure to fill the empty space in her heart.<br /> Sheldon Harris is the love of Tamara's life, but they are not connecting, and the birth of their son does not draw them closer; it seems to be driving them further apart. Tamara's background has made her insecure about her maternal instincts, so she gives sole custody of Sheldon Jr., to his father. Unforeseen circumstances force Tamara to become a part of her son's life and she is terrified that she will fail herself and her child.<br /> Natalie Darden's All About Me is a wonderful, yet complicated story. It deals with all types of relationships but she ties them all together to show the reader why Tamara is such a complex individual. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of Ms. Darden's work.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-12-15
Friends or Lovers?	Shemone and Darnell had been friends for years, but went their separate ways after high school. Shemone went on to college to pursue a career in writing, while Darnell went to prison after pursuing a lucrative, yet illegal drug career.  The death of a mutual friend places them back in contact after many years and their connection is undeniable.  After his release from prison, Shemone and Darnell have to answer the difficult question; Can life long friends become lovers without sacrificing the friendship?<br />Although the main focus of the story is the friendship and ultimately the relationship between Shemone and Darnell, Hunter Hayes does an excellent job in tackling various other social issues.  Infidelity, trust, prostate cancer, social inequality and family relations are several sub plots that added depth and consciousness to the story.<br />Hunter Hayes has done a superb job with her sophomore novel.  The characters are true to life and the plot has several different elements that keeps it flowing and crisp.  I would recommend this novel to any one looking for a quick read that is both funny, romantic, and socially conscious. I look forward to future works from this author.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy	2002-12-10

Nicole's main purpose in<br />life is to find out who her mother is and why she left her.<br />Xavier Ramon is a hard-nose military man who heads up the military<br />police at the local military base. After his wife walks out on him<br />and his son, Xavier refuses to try to understand or trust women<br />again. He promises himself he will never allow another woman to hurt<br />him.<br />Nicole and Xavier are brought together by mutual friends and although<br />upset with the matchmaking, soon realize they have something very<br />unique and in common. But as always there are issues and revealing<br />events that will take Nicole and Xavier on a trusting journey. They<br />must now do a self-evaluation to let go of the past and move on to<br />the future. Will there actually be a happily ever after?<br />Although Ms. Carmichael's storyline was nice, it didn't quite draw in and strengthen the characters and the overall<br />story, nor did  the plot succeed in pulling me in; the story was even a bit predictable too early in the story.<br />In spite of this, Magnolia Sunset is a book that I would<br />recommend you read and draw from it the essence and importance of<br />accepting who you are and learning to trust others.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2002-12-10

Their quest for money and a materialistic lifestyle forever changes their lives.  The book also includes the story of Vita, a rival of the girls, and her struggle to survive.<br />Tiffany Womble has created a compelling look at street life and the lengths that some women will go through for material success. She allows us to look into the psyche of each girl and see underlying motivations that contribute to their quest for money. I eagerly anticipate Tiffany Womble's future works, which will include a series that is extended versions of the characters of Liquid Dreams.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy	2002-12-10
A Common Thread	Michael R. Lane has crafted an awe inspiring literary gem with Crossroads. The novel, set in Pittsburgh, is a series of short vignettes chronicling the lives around Gratey Johnson, also known as The Prophet.  Lane carefully contructs over ten characters, each belonging to a common thread - dealing with the curveballs that life often throws.<br />We are taken from a tragic accident to the core of the Vietnam War. We are told of lost family members, rich family traditions, abandonment, and, centrally, the effects of the Vietnam war in all who were involved both indirectly and directly. This is a self-published work of art -- an error free, emotionally stimulating quality work. A sharp novel with a raw look at the ties that bind, Crossroads left me speechless.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-12-10
Standing Alone	Have you ever wanted to read a story based on true events that reads like a novel?  The Twelfth Man Standing fits the bill as a true story that is stranger than fiction.  Michael Holmes is a hard working police officer who takes odd jobs working as security to supplement his meager income.  When a trusted friend presents him with an offer too good to be true, he apprehensively signs on as a security escort for pay that far surpasses that of any of his other jobs.  Eventually, Holmes finds that he is a player in a game where success and failure can mean the difference between life and death.<br />Although this book is based on true events, Holmes' account of his experiences is a true page turner.  The book is filled with emotion, suspense and intrigue.  All of the key players and scenes in the book are written so descriptively that I found myself easily visualizing each scene as if I were watching a movie.  I could empathize with Holmes and experienced his fear, frustration, anger and sense of betrayal, as I read.  The book offers an interesting perspective on loyalty, crime, and law enforcement.  I applaud Michael Holmes for sharing his story through this book and more importantly for having the courage to stand alone and do what is right.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-28
Sensual Entertainment	Looking for an enjoyable collection of erotic stories written by well-known authors that we have all come to respect?  Best Black Women's Erotica is a wonderful book to pique your interest in the erotica.<br />Iyanla Vanzant's introduction takes you down memory lane to a time when we all had a variety of names for the intimate parts of our body. You will truly laugh and smile at some of Iyanla's reminiscing of the antics of her growing up.<br />The selection of erotic stories were good and had you turning pages very quickly to find out what happens next. Zane's \\"Mergers and Acquisitions\\" sums up why she is becoming a popular writer of erotic stories. Bertice Berry, Tananarive Due, Renee Swindle, Karen Johnson, just to name a few authors, all had something to say and they said it well. You will enjoy their stories.<br />What was really deep was Nikki Giovanni's \\"Bring On the Bombs: A Historical Interview.\\" This was definitely something different from the empress of poetry, but it also told me that she could be diversified in her writing. Great work Nikki.<br />Overall, I recommend that you read Best Black Women's Erotica edited by Blanche Richardson.<br />I don't think you will be disappointed. I must also commend the great selection of writers who<br />have ventured from their normal genre to entertain us with some great erotica selections. Good work ladies!<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2002-11-21
A dance of love	From the time she was seven years old, dancing consumed Brynn<br />Halsted's life.  Dancing for her was like being in love for the<br />first time, and being loved back.  At sixteen, a day after the<br />death of her father, she displayed a toughness that belied her<br />years as she executed a performance that propelled her into stardom.<br />Simeon Storey, a fresh, young, up and coming pianist once played<br />for Brynn and was so mesmerized by her performance, he waited<br />anxiously in the wings to meet her and share his dreams of<br />writing a score just for her.  But as Brynn passed she just<br />looked right through him.<br />Four years later fate has again placed Simeon in Brynn's path.<br />A devastating attack has injured Brynn's body and spirit.

Brynn is on a path of self-discovery<br />and Simeon is finding the courage to trust in love again.<br />Ms. Johnson has written an endearing story about triumph and<br />tragedy, set in Harlem, reminiscent of the Renaissance era. This<br />is a Contemporary Romance, but this story clearly shows that life<br />is not all fluff. That when two people are trying to build a<br />romance, the issue of personality flaws must still be faced and<br />concessions must be made.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-11-18
Never a dull moment	What do a doberman, a gay hairdresser, an ex-model mama, and an entertainment lawyer have in common?  They're all looking out for Shawni Baldwin.

From then on, Shawni is forced to reevaluate her stance on life, and the fact that she is so dependent on men.<br />Boles' characters jump off the page at you, demanding to be heard.

But Jay throws caution to the wind and soaks<br />up the country and the man.  Once she's home she discovers that Trent<br />is indeed one of the forbidden Prescotts. How can she explainto her<br />grandmother what she has done?<br />My one issue is that the basis of the story and the driving force for<br />most of Jay's actions were glossed over almost hurriedly.  But this<br />was an interesting story with a message that, it is impossible to<br />grasp the present if you will not let go of the past.<br />Reveiwed by aNN Brown	2002-11-18
Bella	In Wanda Thomas' Passion's Journey, we travel back and forth from Denver, Colorado to New York City, the Caribbean Islands and Paris, France.  So much passion is generated with the two major characters that the settings make for a fantastic journey.<br />Jacqueline Tyler is trying to capture her first real success as an acquisitions editor at a publishing house.  While she succeeds at her job, her personal life is another story.  Henrico Augostini is an architectural engineer who left his father's software company, much to his father's dismay, to make a go of Augostini's Engineering.  Jacqueline is in need of respite from her philandering mate but she also harbors painful memories of her childhood that she must overcome.  Henrico's father consistently thwarts his attempts of winning construction contracts, which sends Henrico into a slump.  When these two lost souls meet on a cruise, a journey in and of itself begins.<br />The secondary characters, the family and friends of Jacqueline and Henrico, are emotional, at times humorous and are portrayed realistically. While taking us on a whirlwind ride of denying attraction and finally love, Passion's Journey explores the racial and class prejudices we hold which prevent the characters from seeing true love right before their eyes.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

From a Refugee to a Harvard grad	Selamawi \\"Mawi\\" Asgedom tells of his journey from an Ethipoian/Eritrean refugee to a harvard graduate in his poignant memoir, Of Beetles and Angels. Driven by his family's tireless encouragement, this miracle man faced the challenges of leaving a culture, a homeland, and a way of life behind. Finding angels in the most unlikely places, Mawi reteaches the reader the golden rule through his and his family's acceptance of others, and genuine willingness to help those in need.<br /><br />I was moved by the recounting of the Asgedoms' trials and triumphs.<br /> This is truly an example of what family should mean; encouraging one another, pushing each other to do their best, and most strikingly, the cohesion that American families sometimes lack. Reading more like a collection of short stories than a work of non-fiction, Of Beetles and Angels captures the reader's attention, emotions, and heart throughout.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-11-15
Mystery in the Bayou	The death of her father brings Rayenetta Dalcour back to Belle Rose,<br />a small burrow in Baton Rouge, LA., but Rae is no longer the wild<br />rebellious teenager who left 15 years ago. She is now a renowned<br />blues guitarist and she lives her life with no excuses.<br />Rae wants to clear her grandfather's name, fulfill her father's dream<br />and then get out of Belle Rose. The battles between the tenants of<br />the Back of the Bayou and the well-to-do St. Cyr and Jove families,<br />have taken its toll on her.<br />Plans to clear her Pawpaw's name are hampered by handsome Simon<br />St. Cyr, who has links to her troubled past. While Simon is equally<br />enthralled with Rae, he knows what they are trying to build will<br />undoubtedly be tested if Rae delves into the past to solve<br />a decades-old mystery of illicit love.  Both are afraid that<br />awakening ghosts from the past may place them on opposing sides.<br />Ms. Emery has taken a familiar theme of the 'have and the have nots'<br />and weaved a wonderful romantic mystery focusing on the love of<br />family. The Bayou is an excellent setting for this beautiful love<br />story with just a twist of gris-gris.  I've read all of Lynn's books<br />and this, like the others, makes you want to experience a piece of<br />Louisiana. This spicy tale will warm the heart like a bowl of Nawlins'<br />jambalaya.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-11-15
Gripping and Compelling	Someone is killing transients in Phoenix, Arizona and the police are grasping at straws. Their murder log shows eight other connecting cases in which the J. Doe's, all of which are prostitutes, are disposed of grotesquely, placed in garbage bags and then dumped.<br />Robert 'Chickenhead' Gibbs, homeless for seven years, has been searching for his girlfriend, Mimi Driver, for the last four days. Living in what is called the Little Beirut section near downtown Phoenix has Robert worried about the possibilities of her disappearance. This area is where every illicit activity imaginable is produced, packaged and served to unscrupulous clientele. Will Robert find Mimi alive or will her disappearance be the lead the police need to crack the case?<br />I will not label this book a murder mystery because readers are informed early who the perpetrator is. Still, having this knowledge does not dampen the story because the sleuth's arrogance, and taunting display of superiority keeps the reader on edge. This is a well-written story and Mr. Crockett does<br />an excellent job showcasing the horrors of living life on the streets. A reader might be pushed to look at homelessness with a new awareness. If you're looking for a change of pace, try this book.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-11-15
Eyes Can Lie	Crimes have been committed in the small town of Emerson Woods.  Beulah Baptist Church has been set ablaze and when Randolph McGee stumbles upon the arsonist during his morning jog, he is shot to death by the merciless culprit in an attempt for the arsonist to protect his identity.  Beulah Baptist, a church a predominately Black congregation, has been a source of controversy in the small community every since it was built in a predominately White part of town.  When the police begin to question potential witnesses, two starkly different descriptions of the arsonist emerge.  All the witnesses describe the same apparel, height and build, but some describe the alleged suspect as being White while one describes him as a Black man.  The stakes are raised even higher when the church fire is linked to similar church arsons throughout the South.  The ensuing investigation results in unlikely friendships developing, and racial division at it's worst.  Who really committed the crime and which \\"eyewitness\\" description is correct?<br />M.C. Beamon has written a powerful story about how deceiving perceptions can be.  Further she adeptly demonstrated how our racial stereotypes can cause us to \\"see\\" things inaccurately.  This story is so much more than a mystery.  As the author uncovers the clues that will eventually lead us to the truth about the crime, she weaves in lessons about racial healing, faith and justice.  Eyewitness is a novel that reminds us that things are not always as they seem.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-15

In love with their careers, Tina and Mark are headstrong and live by the phrase that \\"tomorrow is never promised\\"; they have goals to achieve and romance and emotional attachments only complicate matters.<br />Leslie Esdaile provides an alluring imagery of several cities in China, utilizing metaphors and similes to brilliantly display the cultural heritage of China and its modern day people.  She skillfully reverts back to the states with the same effective techniques in describing Philadelphia and its inner city, middle class African-Americans.  The traditions of both cultures are laid before our eyes with a realism you can see.<br />One of the most powerful strategies used to entice the reader is the inclusion of the national disaster of September 11 into the story line.  This event provided strong dialogue between the characters that you could feel and see through words.  The reader receives another perspective of the tragedy through the eyes of our military personnel.<br />This is an excellent character driven novel that will stir the depths of your soul.

Yo Yo Yes, But Love No	Yo Yo Love is the debut novel by Daaimah S. Poole and tells the story of Kayla<br />Johnson.  Kayla has decided at the ripe old age of 20 that she is tired of<br />being by herself and that she wants to be in a relationship.  The story that is<br />told in Yo Yo Love is a parent&#146;s nightmare.  Kayla flounders from one unhealthy<br />relationship to another with the thought and hope that the current man will<br />finally be the one.  She lacks a mind of her own and is easily persuaded by the<br />men in her life to do foolish things. Some of the things Kayla did include<br />having sex a few hours after meeting a man , getting a man&#146;s name tattooed to<br />her arm, spending a weekend away with a virtual stranger, and a plethora of<br />other unwise choices.<br />Kayla is irresponsible and immature and she is  placed in situations throughout<br />the story where she must serve as an example to her younger sister. Considering<br />her behavior, this seems unconscionable.  When I started reading this book, I<br />thought that the problem was me and that I wasn&#146;t the target audience. However<br />after dicussing this book with a few people of various ages, I concluded that<br />the story is simply careless. I think it condones reckless behavior and shows<br />little growth in the main character. Towards the end of the book, Ms. Poole<br />throws a lesson in there, but its too little too late and it is negated by<br />actions of Kayla.<br />I think Daaimah Poole has great writing potential.  I can see her talent in<br />this book, but the story simply lacked substance to me.  I got what she was<br />trying to say and I acknowledge that there are women like Kayla in this world,<br />but I simply don&#146;t value reading about the insanity of their behavior.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury.	2002-11-10

Web tips	Published in 1999, Online and Under the Web is a conglomerate of information on everything from promoting a website to building your first web page.  Some great tips, which I encourage my own clients to use, are presented, including credit card processing and opt-in email promotion.  I did, however, to find some of the statistical information to be outdated.  Most of the figures represented 1999 stats, and as a web developer, I can attest that all things web can dramatically change in three years.  My other complaint is that the information seemed to have a lack of flow to it. The book mentions SPAM on one of the opening pages and then tells us 13 pages later what SPAM is.  Even as an experienced web user, the presentation of the information left my brain muddled and my thoughts scattered.  With proper updates, this book would be a worthy read.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-11-10

More than a theory	The Einstein File by Fred Jerome, quickly dispels the poplar image<br />of Albert Einstein as an absentminded, head-in-the-clouds-genius.<br />Though Einstein is arguably the most widely covered, continuing<br />science story in history and is most noted for his scientific<br />theories that transformed our view of the universe.  This book<br />chronicles the life of an Einstein that the masses knew nothing<br />about. An Einstein described as a troublemaker, an agitator, a<br />fervent pacifist, a socialist, and an open critic of racism.<br />Einstein arrived in the United States in 1933, the year of<br />the Nazi's ascent to power in Germany, and became the focus of<br />J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. And by any means necessary the FBI amassed<br />a 'file cabinet' of information on him.  Fred Jerome stumbled on<br />documents that addressed Einstein as a Spy and a Kidnap Plotter.<br />And a dossier where Jerome discovered the political dimension of<br />Albert Einstein's life and his intense commitment to social justice.<br />Jerome says when he realized how much had not been told to us about<br />the life of the 'Man of the Century', he felt as though he had been<br />robbed. This is not another biography of Einstein, some two hundred<br />have already been written. It is a window opened by the FBI on the<br />nature of Einstein's politics, the depth of his public involvement,<br />and the generosity of his endorsements of organizations he supported.<br />And it is this activism that made Hoover's Bureau consider Einstein<br />dangerous. This book reveals information that makes one think the<br />history we know is sanitized, and what we don't know is at times<br />appalling. It talks of a 'list' maintained by the FBI on celebrities,<br />political figures and anyone thought to have  affiliatiions with the<br />Communist Party. It underscores the dangers that can arise, and the<br />rule of law that exists in times of obsession with national security.<br />And it creates questions on where the line should be drawn on the issue<br />of an invasion of privacy.

The view of a player	Reflections Beyond the Mirror is a deliberative look by two<br />comtemporary men at what they see when they venture within<br />themselves.<br />Architect Jamal Jameson and TV news reporter Tory Carter share<br />this story as they float like sexual butterflies from one leaf<br />to another.  There were occasional flashes of a compassionate<br />personality when Jamal questions where they are going with their<br />lives. But Jamal is indecisive, and Tory is egotistical, so they<br />continue to drive themselves to conquer as many women as Tory<br />covers news stories. The female characters are little more than<br />chess pieces, as they are expertly and strategically placed at<br />the discretion of the two men.<br />Mr. Lee at times presents a strong male voice, but this story<br />about professional men in their thirties seems representative of<br />a younger generation with the constant use of rap lines and clich&eacute;s.<br />Lines that had me shaking my head. There was the feeling of listening<br />to men recount, with much braggadocio, their prowess with women.<br />The depth of the characters increased when the author introduced<br />mature emotions into the liaisons and finally a message starts to<br />surface.

Nala's search for<br />relationship happiness forces her to leave her hometown in search of more<br />prospects in the big city of Atlanta.  Upon arriving in Atlanta, Nala finds the<br />same issues that she had in her small hometown.<br />Like She knows Single is the story of  a young woman's search to find oneness<br />and happiness in a relationship and ultimately marriage.  The story falls short<br />because the main character does little introspection and fails to truly reflect<br />on her real issues.  It is told in vignettes of  her meeting men and pursuing<br />them.  Nala is vulnerable to the process of dating and often accepts any type<br />of treatment from would be suitors for a temporary feel good.  She romanticizes<br />marriage and fails to work on the one relationship that she can control  -- one<br />with herself.<br />The book ends with a shabby conclusion, and lacks the ongoing character<br />development of Nala.  The author had a good idea but it somehow got<br />lost in the telling of all of the dating war stories.  Despite the flaws, Ashan<br />Hampton's writing style is entertaining and engrossing.  I look forward to<br />future work by her.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury.	2002-11-10
In the middle of the Mall	If you're looking for a classic whodunit with a no nonsense African American sleuth, Hot Stones, Cold Death may be just what you're after.  Lieutenant Matthew Alexander is on the case when two young men are found murdered in the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History.  The catch? They were dressed in tribal attire and positioned in the museum's African culture diorama.  When a priceless emerald necklace is added to the equation, it's a race to find the thief and the killer.<br />  I found this to be a quickly paced mystery.  Fleming obviously knew the setting of the Smithsonian well, as she accurately described its bureacracy and landmarks with great detail and fluidity.  The major difference I found in this book versus other African American mysteries is the fact that Fleming focused greatly on the case and the resolution of the crime as opposed to the sleuth himself. She constructed the characters well, but there were quite a few to keep up with, as is commonly the case with mystery novels.  Overall, this was a good read that I would definitely recommend to mystery lovers.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-11-10
How far up is the bottom of crime?	Cliff Chandler&#146;s first book, The Paragons is an excellent example of what a crime story should be.  It contains plenty of mystery and enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the book interesting. The story opens immediately following the mysterious death of Elizabeth Crainsworth.  Since there were no immediate suspects for murder, Elizabeth&#146;s wealthy father Ellis Crainsworth hires an investigator to look into the crime in an effort to find some answers and gain some closure.  As a result of the investigation, Ellis obtains some critical evidence.  Eventually this evidence is shared with the police and an elite police squad headed up by maverick cop Vic Morgan is formed to further investigate the crime.  Thus the roller coaster ride of a mystery begins, featuring sex, drugs, small time hustlers and the seemingly untouchable elite.<br />Chandler deftly explores issues of class, while keeping the reader engrossed in a hard hitting yet true to life plot about the impact of drugs in American society and the true roots of the drug problem in America.  He cleverly demonstrates that criminals come in all shapes, sizes and social backgrounds and that sometimes the most dangerous criminals are the ones that never make the news because of their high powered connections.  This is a multi-layered story, not the kind of mystery where you can skip to the end and discover all the answers.  As Detective Vic Morgan and his team discover the answers to some questions, new questions emerge until the book reaches its final explosive ending.  With interesting characters and a high paced plot, The Paragons is a crime story that should not be missed.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-10
His Name So Sweet	His Name is Not God  delves  into the difference between a title and a name from a  biblical perspective.  The book expounds on the theory that there is a difference between someone's title and someone's name. In the Old Testament, people referred to God  through his  attributes  such as  Jehovah Jireh (the Lord Provides)  or Jehovah Shalom (the Lord is my peace). It is in the  New Testament, where  Christians become to know God as a name  because of their  personal relationship  with his  son, Jesus.<br />I found this book to be insightful to  help a person to fully  understand his or her  Christian  journey. This  book would be  helpful to a  Christian seeking a closer walk with the Lord. A  new members class of a church would find this book  helpful to introduce the newly &quot;saved&quot; to building  a relationship with Jesus.<br />Reviewed by Robilyn Heath	2002-11-10

Although he often visited Mattie, outside of her home he never acknowledged his relationship to her.<br /> Jonah Reyes is the nephew of the Evers'maid.

Voices from the youth	In Outer Thinking From the Inner City, author Gerald K. Malcom presents Bianca Ansari, Warren E. Malcom, Lakya Pinkney, and Corporal Clark to the literary scene with fervor.  A collection of poetry and short fiction, Outer Thinking addresses many of the issues adolescents are faced with every day.  With topics from abortion to school, from peer influence to freindships gone sour, anyone who has ever been a teen can relate to the stories these gifted young people share with the world.  Ansari's &quot;Love Is What I Am&quot; is a beautifully symbolic piece dealing with a lost message in a bottle. Pinkney's &quot;A Poem&quot; relays to the reader her need for self-expression.  Both Warren Malcom and Corporal Clark present to us imaginative short stories, Hitchhiker! and Visitors, repectively. I was enamored with the talent these young adults displayed, as I'm sure you will be.	2002-11-07

This is a beautifully written book and is on my top ten list for 2002.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-11-07

You have a total of five characters, all from vastly different socioeconomic backgrounds, intertwined to tell a great story.<br />While I enjoyed the storyline, the message and exciting climaxes, it falls short because of the grammatical errors.

Follow Nina and Richard on their roads to finding themselves, figuring out where their best interests lie, and, most importantly, taking a stand against being taken for granted.<br />~Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-11-07
Full Circle	The Wolf, by Amanda Grihm, opens up a new literary door to an<br />exceptional storyline that holds your attention from the beginning to<br />the end.

The Criminal Mind	The Sex Slave Murders chronicles the crime spree of Gerald and Charlene Gallego.  The couple is often referred to as America's first husband and wife serial killers.  Flowers does an excellent job of laying out the troubled backgrounds of Gerald and Charlene, leading up to their eventual meeting, marriage, and killing spree.  Charlene served as bait, luring young women, and then Gerald would attempt to live out his \\"sex slave\\" fantasy with the victims and ultimately kill them.<br />One of the strongest assets of the book is the attention given to the victims.  Instead of just listing names and dates, Flowers takes time to outline what the victims and their lives were like.  As a result, the reader will get to know the victims, thus, the true impact of the Gallego crimes is better felt and understood.<br />Although this book is non-fiction, it reads more like a novel.  While Gerald's \\"sex slave\\" fantasy was central to the crimes the couple committed, the author does not exploit the fantasy by focusing on the nature of the heinous sexual acts.  Instead the book explores the reasons behind the crime and the reasons why Charlene Gallego was a willing assistant in the crimes.  Most importantly, the book highlights the lives that were cut short or forever changed as a result of the crimes committed by the Gallegos.  While there were a few times in the book that I felt it jumped around and others where it was a bit repetitive, this book was excellent overall.  R. Barri Flowers has done a tremendous job, and if you are looking for a true crime read this book should not be missed.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-05
Love vs Ambition	Ebony Mackenzie is a petite and delicate woman, with a lot of problems. Due to a major trauma and loss that occurred when she was younger. Ebony has a tremendous sense of responsibility to her family. All that Ebony does is work so that she can provide for her family.<br /> Isaiah Malone is a ladies man, but beneath that facade is a man that only wants acceptance and love from one of the most important people in his life. He is a very ambitious man and will do whatever he has to do to get what he wants.<br /> One might think that Ebony and Isaiah are as different as night and day. They are actually more alike than they realize. Both of them are reporters who are chasing the same exclusive interview with Reuben Renfrow the Ice Cream King. Reuben Renfrow has become a recluse and that puts him in high demand for interviews.<br /> In Reon Laudat's It's A Love Thang, sparks fly between Ebony and Isaiah, as they battle for the interview that could change their careers. This book was a quick read and the story was very cute. While some situations were dragged out and could have been shorter, overall I found the book enjoyable and interesting.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-11-05

Facing an uncertain future, this journal seems to be just what Mignon needs to find the strength to start over.  Thus, Mignon begins an emotional journey through two generations of her family's history that will lead to healing and a better understanding of her own life.<br />Nea Anna Simone's first novel, Reaching Back is an excellent work.  The author immediately draws you in to the story and keeps you hooked until the last page.  Simone looks at how social issues such as class and skin color have divided African Americans both historically and in more contemporary settings.  This is a character driven plot, and the reader really gets a chance to see how the characters think and feel.  Towards the end of the story there were a couple of places where the story didn't flow as well as it did in the beginning, but overall this was an excellent read.  This multigenerational story of life, love, and survival, should not be missed.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-05
Tell It Like It Is	Empowering your mind and soul becomes the essence of Sharmel Robinson's Freed by Love \\"Nothing But The Drama\\". The book is a powerful poetic autobiography that is written with such intensity it evokes emotions from the depth of your soul.<br />Ms. Robinson's main inspiration for her poetry comes from Mary J. Blige, however, other artists that have also inspired her writings are Lauryn Hill, Jill Scott, and Macy Gray.  When reading \\"Freed by Love\\" you will definitely focus on the wide range of day to day situations that Shar interprets through her poetry and the turmoil that bought her full circle to make her an empowered woman today.  No words are lost but versed so poetically, you will reap the benefits and enjoy the depth of her presentations.<br />I was very impressed with her poetic style and outlay of words that ring true to every situation revolving around relationships, marriages, infidelity, abuse, lying, and making the wrong and right choices. This is not a book that you can skim through and pick out certain poems to read; you must read from the beginning to the end. Shar Robinson brings it home by  reminding us that we must first love God and self.<br />A book of poems written in this magnitude could not have been any better; she has blown away the secular norm of poetry.  Freed by Love, \\"Nothing But The Drama\\" is definitely a must read that will not disappoint you, but will empower you and Sharmel Robinson is definitely a poetess to watch. I look forward to reading her future works.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2002-11-05
Can Love Conquer All?	R.M. Johnson has done it again as he tells the story of Jayson, Faith and Asha in his recent book, Love Frustration.  Jayson and Faith are just days away from being married when Faith issues an ultimatum.  She tells Jayson that he must chose between her, his future wife, or his \\"friend\\" Asha.  Asha and Jayson have a history that makes Faith uncomfortable, in spite of the fact that Jayson and Faith have both explained that they are just friends and that Asha is involved in a relationship of her own.  This ultimatum leads to an unpredictable chain events and the discovery by all three that nothing is quite as it seems.<br />This book is far more than your typical \\"going to the chapel\\" tale.  Johnson adds complexity to the story through the character development.  Asha struggles to accept her sexual preference, while Jayson and Faith's each have emotional baggage to contend with.  As the characters grapple with fidelity, betrayal and trust you never know what will be revealed next.  The book's climax is both dramatic and emotional. Love Frustration is an unpredictable and engaging read that I highly recommend.<br />-Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-05

Reality Check	I have always enjoyed reading a variety of genre and this book of<br />poems have definitely been one of those rare varieties. Surviving,<br />facing the truth, seeing yourself in a poetic \\"mirror\\" does<br />not even attempt to describe the  passionate style of poems so<br />skillfully written by Marlena Martin in her book titled \\"Poems for<br />Surviving: Breakup Abuse &amp; Divorce.&quot;<br />Breaking up from any relationship or marriage takes a serious toll on<br />both parties regardless of who is leaving.  You can suddenly find<br />yourself not mentally equipped to handle those changes which lead to<br />more stress and turmoil.<br />\\"Poems for Survival\\" gives true testimony to what a woman faces when<br />making changes in her life. Each poem is written so plain and direct<br />allowing you to easy relate to her style and words.  If digested<br />correctly, your reward is understanding that you're not alone in<br />your quest to survive any type of breakup. She opens all the doors<br />of a woman's pain and suffering when making those changes and the<br />struggle to survive.<br />The challenge is to read and hope you don't have to go through<br />any of those breakups. But knowing you have a book to enlighten you<br />and help keep you in the light and not the dark is worth having<br />regardless of your current marital status.

This story is told from the heart and is very realistic. Ultimately, the message this book sends is that love should be about the feelings in your heart, not the color of your skin.

Cassandra leads the women through a journey which includes romance, pain, healing, love and acceptance.<br />Denese Shervington has written a wonderful, lyrical book that weaves beautiful descriptions of Jamaican scenery with emotional turmoil and rebirth.  The character development was excellent and as a result, I found myself really caring about the characters.  The carefully crafted scenes and dynamic use of language give Three Women a more literary feel.  While there was plenty of action to keep the story moving, the plot delved much deeper than superficial drama.  This book is an excellent first effort and I highly recommend it.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-11-01
Healing	When I first picked up the book, \\"Miracles in Healing\\" I was a little wary as I assumed it would be a book of secular miracle healing like cover yourself up with mud and lay there for a while and all your illnesses will go away.<br />Although it is a book explaining the art of healing, Dr. Ross methodically takes us with her on her journey of healing when she is suddenly diagnosed with an illness that causes her to give up her medical practice.  The book reveals to us similar or familiar journeys by others facing their worst fears. It explains to us not to succumb to those fears, but rely on faith which \\"Miracles in Healing\\" by Carolyn Coker Ross, M.D., M.P.H. does just that in a very articulateness and thought out text giving way to spiritual and physical healing.<br />She explains having faith and believing in God, along with conventional treatment, can miraculously bring about unyielding miracles to one's body and soul in the mental and physical sense.  I particularly enjoyed the stories of people that were interviewed and how they coped with, and eventually prescribed themselves their art of healing, which eventually became their miracles. The book contains in each chapter, a listing of resources for you to refer to and read; plus there is space<br />after each listing for you to detail or jot down any particular notes, which makes it very convenient to the reader.<br />It is a very uplifting read and should appeal to anyone who feels defeated, but still looking for a ray of hope.  Thank you, Dr. Ross, for sharing portions of your life and the life of thers with readers who may have had family members, or have themselves been on the receiving end of sudden illnesses and<br />struggling to cope.  I recommend you read \\"Miracles in Healing\\" and you will appreciate one woman's determination to stand up and not fall down.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2002-11-01

The book's characters were so different some I grew to love and others that I loved to hate, but they added depth and richness to the story that is indescribable.  While this is mainstream fiction, Jackson's command over things romantic is evidenced through the passionate loves scenes intermingled throughout the book.

Despite an uncaring mother and a turbulent past, Raine has continuously pressed onward, determined to reach the top and never look back.<br />In the midst of her journey, she receives a mysterious letter.

Who is behind the letter and what are their motives? Will these ever be revealed? These<br />and many other questions will be brought to light throughout the course of the story.<br />While Ms. Thompson offers us a unique storyline, the story unfortunately lacks the excitement that usually comes with mysteries. With this exclusion, the story occasionally takes a slow turn and at times, I felt that I was reading a biography rather than a thrilling mystery. Despite this, Ms. Thompson<br />still shows promise as an author and I look to see continued growth from her in upcoming novels.<br />Reviewed by Kanika Wade	2002-11-01

The characters are so well developed, they seem real and though there's much drama, it's not over the top.  My only issue with the book is the ending...it just seemed a bit too neat for me and ended too soon.  I wanted to know more, but nonetheless, it's a wonderful read that touches on issues relevant to everyday living.	2002-10-18
Poignant Look into our History	What first time author Elyse Singleton has done within the pages of This Side of the Sky is truly remarkable.  She has taken missing events from a history book detailing the impacts of poverty, puberty, and racism of two African American women and the events leading up to World War II and afterwards. Singleton has written a story that isn't easily labeled because it is so much more than simply a historical fiction novel.<br />It touches on the love and friendship between two best friends, Lilian Mayfield and Myraleen Chadham, their joint and individual triumps, hardships, and romances in a small town in Mississippi.  It also shares their contribution to history as WACs and their efforts in the war, stationed at a base in England.  Additionally, we see the lengths they'd go to support each other, in spite of the economic times during the war.<br />The story is written in a warm, poignant and enlightening literary tone while at the same time it entertains, educates, and portrays more about this time frame in history than the average history books.  It also does a wonderful job of sharing the lesson of looking beyond a person's skin color to determine their value. The characters are well developed and will stay with you long after you've finished reading.  I definitely recommend this book and would encourage anyone to pick it up regardless of your preference in genres.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal	2002-10-18
So you want to go to law school?	Are you an African American with dreams of law school? If so, it is highly recommended that you read The African American Pre-Law School Advice Guide by Evangeline M. Mitchell, J.D. Ms. Mitchell poses important questions and situations that will help contribute to your decision as to whether law school is the place for you.<br /> Each chapter of this book breaks down the pre-law and the law school experience. It breaks myths and gives you a laundry list of things that the prospective law student will need to consider. Such as the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), financial aid and beyond. Overall, this is a very helpful book, and I believe that the author developed it so that she can help people to make an informed decision whether or not to attend law school. Also, the questions that are posed to the reader can actually be used in making decisions about college or graduate school.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-10-15
Flipping the Script	All That and a Bag of Chips opens as Venice Taylor says goodbye to her close-knit family and her high school sweetheart, Jarvis.  Jarvis will be leaving as well to attend a different college where he received a football scholarship.  In spite of the fact that Jarvis and Venice share a complicated past and still share strong feelings for one another, the two of them have agreed to see other people while away at college.  Venice arrives at school, anxiously anticipating her \\"college experience\\" and her newly found freedom.  Right away she meets Craig, an upperclassman, and there is an immediate attraction.<br />Venice knows that she still has strong feelings for Jarvis but also wants to explore a potential relationship with Craig.  Venice now has both men vying for her affection and undivided attention.  Who will she choose?  Can she have it both ways?  Will she lose either or both men while she is trying to decide?<br />Darrien Lee has done a great job putting a new spin on the relationship novel.  She made you care about the characters even if you didn't like them.  Personally, I disliked Venice and felt she was extremely self-centered.  I wanted the characters in the story to stop doting on her and for at least one character to share my distaste in her.  However, these feelings made the storyline even more powerful and had me turning page after page trying to see how it would end.  In addition to the passionate love scenes, and humorous college antics, the author weaves in relevant social issue without seeming preachy.  I anxiously look forward to the sequel of this book.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-10-15

For the modern day slave	Do not pick up this book to be entertained, it should do more than<br />that, it should enlighten, empower and educate anyone who wants to<br />break the chains of Economic Bondage.<br />It is written by a young man who was so stirred by Harriet Tubman,<br />that he wanted to empower individuals to step outside of the<br />slave-master mentality and adapt to the elements of the 21st century.<br />Because poverty has no color or limitations, it just exists.<br />The New Underground Railroad is about freeing people who need to be<br />economically enlightened.  It is an escape plan intended to educate<br />the readers about real estate, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. And<br />to teach about the effects of inflation and taxation.

The courage to read	Brandy was half-white.  Brandy was a slave. Brandy was sold. Brandy became Helen.<br />Sold from her wailing mother's arms at the age of eleven, Helen's life was changed forever when she was relocated to the Joseph plantation, Arcadia.  She learned the science of herbs from the plantation's conjure woman, was the playmate of choice of Arcadia's young Master Benjamin, and became a field worker when it was seen that she could do a fair share of work.  In addition, Helen taught herself to read by stealing glances at writing and permanently emblazening letters into her mind. And this was all in her first year there.<br />The Thief of Letters by Janet Mountain Johnson gives us a glimpse into the life of a field worker, to a house slave, to a mulatto mistress.  I was so enraptured by this book that sleep seemed an annoyance, and I battled it, the book resting in my hands late into the night.  The writing is superb, worthy of any award that has been bestowed on any piece of litereature.  The characters are real, feeling, and human, and tears oft found their way to my cheeks as I walked with them along their path of bondage.  Anyone who can read should read this book. Anyone who can't will be encouraged to learn after hearing of the Thief of Letters.<br />~ Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-10-14

So ladylike	Some women think all men are dogs. Some women have been hurt by men. Some women seek revenge on their male counterparts who have wronged them. But, how many women would go to the extreme to rid the planet of smooth talking, womanizing players?  The Lady Killer did.<br />After his brother is killed, Jasper &quot;Jaz&quot; Ballantine has a score to settle with the Lady Killer.  Hot on her trail, he and his psychologist ex-wife Dhana soon find that they are working on more than just the case.<br />Filled with romance, a hint of suspense, and psychological thrills, Lady Killer by Gail McFarland kept me turning the pages not only to see if the killer was caught, but also if Jaz and Dhana could reconcile their relationship.  It's not really what I would consider a &quot;mystery&quot;, as the killer is revealed early on.  Instead, I'd call it a worthy piece of supsenseful romance in which the characters are likeable and real, and the crime is deviant, yet possible.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-10-06
A Soulful Journey	A Woman's Soul On Paper is a soulful and thought provoking book which is written in a narrative voice by the author, Cassandra George Sturges.  It's a story about a journey from self-help through self-discovery based on Sturges personal memoirs.  The journey begins with the illustration on the book cover.  A woman is writing in her diary and she is in deep thought as noted by her reflection in a mirror.  This illustration is what inspired me to start reading the book.<br />Sturges bares her soul on paper in a quiet and spiritually uplifted voice.  Her stories are indeed a testament of strength and spirituality.  Although she writes about the most intimate details of her journey you know that she is sending you a heart felt message.  Sturges is truly a gifted writer.<br />This book reminded me so much of my own journey in life.  I was able to relate to most of her stories.  I cried and laughed while reading this book.  I highly recommend this book to all women.  You won't want to put it down.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2002-10-06
Interesting and Eclectic Mix...	The Long Train To The Redeeming Sin by Kola Boof is an interesting and<br />eclectic mix of short stories and poetry that are pro-Africa and pro-woman.<br />Boof, a Sudanese-American woman, writes in story teller's fashion and<br />weaves tales that transport readers to Africa.<br />The stories are folksy and could easily make the transition to verbal telling<br />because they are charismatic and richly layered.  Many of the stories speak of<br />the relationship between Black people and Mother Africa and make comparisons<br />between Black people born in Africa and Black people stolen from Africa<br />generations ago.<br />Equally as interesting as the stories is Boof, herself.  From her introduction<br />to her author interview at the end to her semi-nude photo on the book cover,<br />readers will find themselves searching for validation of truths in Boof's<br />characters and from Boof herself.  Boof tells compelling tales that if the<br />reader looks closely will hit home, time and time again.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)	2002-10-06
Be Still My Heart	The writing team of J. M. Jeffries mixes romance with an ingenuous blend of murder mystery in their latest novel, Southern Comfort. Hardesty Arnaud comes home from the military and assumes the role of Police Chief of St. Martine, Louisiana; she is a trust fund baby thanks to her family's wealth in the bayou. Nick Brannigan travels to St. Martine on assignment for the FBI; he is a man that was saved from the ghettos of Harlem. When these two stubborn souls meet all hell breaks loose in the small town of St. Martine. Add to the fact that St. Martine has not seen a murder in ten years, in addition to the fact that everyone in town knows everyone's business and you have a story of intriguing proportions. Other interesting and seemingly culpable characters add a vivaciousness that begs you to keep reading to get the answers to who, what, when, where and why?<br />This duo did an excellent job of descriptive writing when graphically accounting for the landscapes of Louisiana's small towns and the fast city of New Orleans. While romance novels are one of boy gets girl and vice versa, Southern Comfort is a well-drawn, character driven illustration of mystery, small town America, family ties, interracial love and matters of the heart.	2002-10-06

It seemed that the world could feel the love emanating from Jim and Louella, and many of their neighbors in their small Georgia town came to them for help with their own affairs.<br /> Berry has created a wonderful cast of characters in this novel.  I kept hoping this book would never end.  The writing is conversational in tone and powerful in content, as Louella proves that what the world DOES need now is love, sweet love.<br />~ Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-10-03
True History	The African American has come a long way, or have they? American Nightmare: The History of Jim Crow by Jerrold M. Packard chronicles the very beginnings of the well know, well established Jim Crow system developed in America decades ago. It was a successful system that put into place, laws which kept the African America a second-class citizen even after slavery was abolished. The purpose was to keep sacred and separate any person of color from becoming equal to the white establishment.<br />American Nightmare is an intense historical recollection of Jim Crow years and the plight of the African American. It is a powerful book and Mr. Jerrold very skillfully details in length the root causes, the rationale, the religious and educational aspects, and the dismantling of the vicious Jim Crow system.  This book reminds us how devastating this era was and that we should never allow anything resembling this degrading system to ever surface again.<br />I applaud Jerrold M. Packard for producing a book that reminds us all of who we are and where we are today.  It is an historical and educational guide of the past, present, and for the future of America to strengthen its human rights policies to insure that all citizens are treated equal.

When Rachel's father is accused and charged with setting his popular restaurant on fire, Rachel and Nicholas' paths cross which is the beginning of an inferno.<br />The characters face a dilemma that mixes responsibilities with matters of the heart, adding fuel to a raging fire.

Each character has a story to tell (which is not glossed over nor overdone) that adds an understanding to their existing plight.<br />Smith does such an excellent job of blending mystery and romance, this story had me turning the pages trying to decide whom the culprit was, only to be fooled several times.

A PERFECT PICTURE OF DENIAL	Afraid Of The Dark by Michelle Devlin is the story of a woman trying to learn<br />how to battle the demons of her childhood. Ali Connery, the main character in<br />Afraid, decides to seek therapy after being afraid of the dark and many other<br />things for many years. When she begins therapy she shares details about her<br />childhood, which was filled with sexual and drug abuse.<br />Ali's story is a repetitive one of insanity and denial about her chemical<br />addiction. She flounders through life in a drugged state, denying her addiction<br />and trying to numb the pain of her past. While she is under the care of a<br />therapist and psychiatrist, she resists treatment due to her reluctance to deal<br />with the levels of hurt that she's been burying for years.<br />Afraid Of The Dark is a decent book. It adequately shows the cycle of addiction<br />from its possible causes, treatment options, and the denial that often plague<br />many who suffer from it. What the book falls short of doing is telling the<br />whole story. Ali has had an ugly life and she continues to perpetuate its<br />ugliness with her destructive behavior. Anyone from the Mental Health field who<br />reads this book will spend time diagnosing Ali and empathizing with her<br />treatment team and support circle. This book would be a good read for beginning<br />students in Social Work and Addiction who would benefit from seeing an<br />effective portrait of a dual diagnosed addict. However, the novel would have<br />been more effective if there was a successful example of the recovery and<br />treatment process as well.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)	2002-10-03

STRANGE BUT TRUE	Yet A Stranger: Why Black Americans Still Don't Feel At Home is a provocative account by Deborah Mathis which explores the feelings and experiences of Black Americans.  Ms. Mathis candidly writes about how the experiences of Black People in America have caused a prolonged feeling of alienation which has impacted their sense of community.  She asserts that the progress that has been made in race relations is not enough and more needs to be done to dispel the feelings of displacement that many African-Americans continue to feel.  She gives storical context and media examples of how racism continues to be pervasive in society.  She shows how today's racism, although subtle, is just as damaging as in the past.  Ms. Mathis proposes ways for the Black Community to heal itself and restore a sense community that was once evident in the neighborhoods of Black people.  Practical ideas such as supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities, creating financial collaborations, recreating the village model, and reconnecting with God are suggested.<br />Yet a Stranger is a thorough analysis that not only states the problems, but suggests solutions.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury	2002-10-03

The Crimes Remain Unsolved	Atlanta, Georgia from 1979-1983 was a very scary place for young African American children. And I was one of them. Our parents were paranoid, emotional, and cautious. Leaving Atlanta depicts the torrid years of Atlanta's missing and murdered children. While the atrocity of snatching kids is the main plot, acceptance, loneliness, and poverty hang in the backdrop taking on supporting responsibilities. It was these subplots that battered my heart, and made my eyes wet.<br />Tayari Jones tells this story from the viewpoint of LaTasha, Rodney, and Octavia. They are honest, naive, and unspoiled kids aware of and dismayed by the missing kids whose faces disappeared from their classrooms only to reappear on the missing list during the 6 o'clock news. We read their thoughts as they grapple with the terror of potentially being the next missing child and the pain of realizing that some of their friends are missing, and probably murdered.<br />Being inside their adolescent minds was familiar, piercing, and unavoidable. We learn of their inner feelings, woes, and fears. We are with them day to day. It was so vivid that it was almost eerie. The details from that time period were magnificent. Tayari's metaphors and similes are vivid and luring, reminding me of graphics. She'd make a statement, then provide an accompanying metaphor or simile. It's like a graphic with a caption. I sincerely enjoyed this novel, and I bet you will too.<br />-Reviewed by MissLove	2002-10-03

Nothing is sacred	Anthing Goes by Jessica Tilles is the perfect title for<br />this book. It is a mix of passion, betrayal, jealously,<br />selfishness and raw uninhibited sex.<br />Twenty-seven year old Raven Ward's sexual escapades have<br />no boundaries. She does not care who her partners are<br />or where the action takes place, and the freakier the better.<br />Hurt from being jilted at the altar, she seems to carry the<br />weight of the devil perched on her shoulder. She talks about<br />a good man in her life, who will love her. But when the<br />opportunity arrives to fulfill this desire, Raven is too deep<br />into getting her freak on and too intent on paying some<br />brothas back to embrace what is being offered. The supporting<br />characters offered little support in terms of adding substance<br />to the book. Everyone seemed to jump into a sexual abyss with<br />only one thought: Anything goes.<br />This is Ms. Tilles' debut novel and she has indeed written<br />it from an interesting angle, but for me it was about living<br />a 'nothing is sacred' life style. About over the top sex<br />and not much else. This was not my kind of read, so I will<br />not claim to be the best judge of this book. This is one you<br />should read for yourself.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-10-03
Deep dark family secrets and old grudges	Celia, written by S.L. Cullars is an electrifying novel.  Ghostly haunts, old murders, and family secrets are basic to this novel.

How can this be since Celia died in a tragic car accident over thirty years ago?  When Cheryl arrives home and is greeted by her Aunt Gladys she is overwhelmed with so many memories.  While unpacking in her room she looks in the bathroom mirror and sees Celia's reflection looking back at her.  Everywhere she goes she sees Celia and there is always the mysterious scent of lilacs.  Cheryl knows when she smells the lilacs that Celia is always present.  A trip to the cemetery to see the grave of her grandmother, who had died several weeks, makes Cheryl question whether Celia's death was really an accident.<br />In the story, we also meet Arthur Blevins the young, handsome attorney who handled Cheryl's grandmother estate.  They began a relationship and sparks start flying.  It is with Arthur's help that Cheryl begins to solve the mystery of Celia death.<br />Cullars' writing is clear and with excellent characterization.  The plot is tightly woven to keep the reader interested.  There is no way you can guess what happens next and it flows easily.  Cullars takes family drama and mystery to a new level.  Celia is by far the best mystery novel I've read this year and I would recommend it to mystery lovers.  This is one novel that should be made into a movie. You cannot understand the meaning of haunting until you read this novel.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2002-10-03

And this time more than her<br />knee will get scarred.<br />I've become accustomed to how Ms. Hodge writes, the drama never<br />overshadows the characters, and this time she delivers again.<br />The story is so basically human, that it will have readers<br />sitting back pondering the solution; a solution where undoubtedly<br />someone will reap and someone will lose. A wonderful human interest<br />read, I urge you to pick this one up.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-09-27

She has found within herself a mysterious force that is now controlling the course of her life.<br /> Leslie by author Omar Tyree is an awesome book that draws you into Leslie's mind, a dark and sometimes scary place. This book is filled with rage, hurt and a general feeling of helplessness. But if you look deeper you will also see hope. This book was excellent and is in my opinion Mr. Tyree's best work. I look forward to reading more of the author's work in the future.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-09-27

Unbelievable Secrets! - 3.5 Stars	'Secret - something kept hidden or unexplained.'<br />What Secret Jones wants explained is why in this small town in<br />Kentucky, is she cursed?  Why the only thing she knows about her<br />Mother, is her name. And why on the dawn of her eight birthday, is<br />the only person to ever love her taken away?<br /><br />This is an unbelievable story of how a whole town kept silent, and<br />collectively hid the tragic invents that  befell a young girl named<br />Jocelyn.  But the most unbelievable horror is who the perpetrators<br />were and the lives that were ultimately  destroyed.<br />Now fourteen years old, Secret Jones wants answers, someone knows,<br />and she is determined that nothing and no one will deter her from<br />what she is destined to know.  But, when her questions are answered,<br />what she learns is worst than anything she could have imagined.<br />And this knowledge has her wondering more vehemently, who she is.<br />My confusion with this story centers on the time frame or era in<br />which this story takes place. Some of the expressions and language<br />used by the characters were indicative of the language of today,<br />but the scenic descriptions led me to believe this was a period<br />piece.  Even with the era issues, Ms. Cornelius has written a story<br />that truly stretches the imagination. One that exposes how cruel,<br />inhumane actions and deadly secrets destroyed a family and a town.<br />The ending brought closure for Secret, but as a reader, the shocking<br />revelation had me speculating if certain things should have remained<br />a secret? An amazing story. (Really a 3.5)<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-09-27
On My Own	Never Too Much is a gritty tale of the lives of several young, urban, African Americans.  The story follows the lives of teens that have more than a handful of life's challenges.  Barel has attempted suicide before and is struggling to fight the urge to try again.  Davon is experimenting sexually and trying to come to terms with his true sexual identity.  Rahliem is paying for his past mistakes while trying to hold his family together.  Jalail is a teenage parent working to take care of his child and his baby's mother. Throughout the course of the book, each of these characters deal with adversity and drama while trying to survive.<br />With tighter editing this book has the potential to be much more than a 3 star book.  Imes does an excellent job capturing the voice of teens and young adults and as a result, the dialogue was realistic.  Each of the primary characters is rotated as narrators in the book, and as a result each has a strong voice.  Never Too Much is a short book, but it covers several different story lines. I think the book would have been more powerful if the author had focused attention on a couple of these story lines and developed them more or made the book a little longer.  Still, I found the book to be a quick and pleasant read.  I look forward to watching the continued growth of this author and would definitely read more of his work in the future.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-09-27
Never too Late	Have you ever felt so overwhelmed by your life that you wished you could run away and start a new one?

She was at her wits end and finally decided to do something about it.<br />Juanita has always been a survivor.  She has survived unhappy relationships, an unfulfilling job, and three irresponsible children.  She works hard and then comes home to take care of her grown children and grandchild on a daily basis and is generally disappointed with what her life has become.

We then follow Juanita across state lines as she, at the age of 42, searches for a new beginning.<br />Dancing on the Edge of the Rood is a wonderful book about a woman who musters up the courage to try and become more.  The book is humorous, romantic, and an overall enjoyable read.  Sheila Williams has combined witty dialogue with superb character development.  This book is an excellent story of self discovery and I highly recommend it.<br />--Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-09-27
The storms that rage within	Imagine having an older sister whom you were constantly expected to protect. Imagine this sister being mentally ill. Imagine Stacy Moore's life.    Rikki Moore, beautiful, smart, and devout, has always leaned on her younger sister for protection, support, and acceptance.  From childhood fears and dysfunction, adolescent suicide attempts, and marital problems, Rikki's life seems out of control, and Stacy is always the one to clean up the debris Rikki's storms leave in their wake.<br />  This book is a real page turner. Hall has convincingly related a story of mental illness for all to hear.  Her writing is more characteristic of a seasoned novelist than of a debut author, and I was enraptured with Rikki, Stacy, and all of the other characters.  A real eye-opener to the storms that rage within, A Quiet Storm transcends societal factors by focusing on humanism and emotion.<br />~Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-09-27

The book is structured in an easy to read format with each chapter consisting of an expression, advice, the author's personal testimony and a blueprint.  The expression is essentially the overall theme or thought of the chapter.  It is followed by a section called \\"For My Girls\\" which contains advice relating to the expression.  Next, the author shares \\"My Testimony\\" where she shares an example of how this particular expression has impacted her own life.  Finally, the chapter is concluded with a \\"Blueprint,\\" which serves as an affirmation relating to the theme.  The author covers a vast array of topics including developing a good work ethic, trusting in yourself, appreciating personal strength, handling life's frustrations, and determining self worth.<br />Yasmin Shiraz has written an excellent book filled with everyday wisdom and common sense advice.  She openly and honestly shares both her good and bad experiences and uses them to give life to her advice and affirmations. Although this book would be great for any woman to read, it is a must for teenagers and young adults.  This book would make a wonderful gift for all the young women in your life.

Against All Odds	A Brownstone in Brooklyn chronicles a short but critical portion of the life of Andy Michael Pilgrim.  Andy has grown up in a Brownstone on Gates Avenue in Brooklyn and all of its residents have contributed to his upbringing.  However, this book takes place during a turbulent time in American history.  The civil rights movement seems to be taking a more violent turn, and young men across the nation are being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War...<br />The lively cast of characters keep this novel fresh and entertaining while the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Thompson does a wonderful job highlighting how people's lives are influenced by the types of choices they make.  He also highlights how much one person's actions can impact the lives of others in meaningful ways.  The book started out a little slow, but gradually picked up momentum.  I would have liked a bit more character development for Andy's character earlier in the book.  In the early parts of the book I felt like I was reading about his day to day life without enough background to really care about his character, but by the end I felt like I knew him well.  A Brownstone in Brooklyn is an enjoyable read that truly demonstrates that it takes a village to raise a child.	2002-09-27
Going back to the past to move forward in the present	There are times and seasons in our lives when because of the past, we will have difficulties in moving forward in the present. At certain points, it becomes difficult to the point where we have to reach out and seek help &amp; support. Author Delores Thornton explores this topic in the novel Babe.<br />In Babe, we are introduced to 82 year-old Beatrice \\"Babe\\" Pearl, a senior citizen with a style that is truly her own. After experiencing a series of painful migraines and nightmares, at the prodding of her daughter she goes in to see psychiatrist Dr. Walker Davis. As she goes through the initial sessions (group &amp; individual), Dr. Davis suggests hypnosis to get to the root of Babe's problems. Under the power of hypnosis, Babe goes back to the roots of her past but is it enough to resolve the issues that will help her move forward in the present?<br />While Mrs. Thornton does an amazing job with presenting vivid imagery and strong dialogue, the story unfortunately falls short with the constant dominance of the supporting characters. Although overall the story is wonderful I felt that at times they received more attention than Babe who is meant to be the focus of the story. I found their stories and personal journeys interesting but I really yearned to learn more about Babe and her life. Despite this, I still intend to support Mrs. Thornton in her future projects-she shows great promise as an author.<br />Reviewed by Kanika Wade	2002-09-27
One World, Two Different Lives	In Ramadhan Nanji's When Day Meets Night, we are introduced to Red and Von, two men who come from the same neighborhood but live completely opposite lives. While Von is an aspiring, determined music producer, Red is a hustler, working the streets and risking his life to provide for himself and his son Tyriq. When Red attempts to rob Von in a botched robbery attempt, in that single moment their lives are drastically changed.<br />As Von attempts to recover from the shooting, he goes on a deep, dark mission to gain vengeance for the pain that he and his loved ones have endured. On the other hand, Red is at a personal crossroads of his own. Will Von obtain justice and peace or will he bring more pain amongst himself? Will Red truly rise above his current situation and let go of the life that he currently knows?<br />While Nanji offers an edgy, insightful tale that truly takes us into the world of urban street life, the story fails to present a clear overall message. Although Red and Von's journeys are clearly depicted, I was still left wondering about the true meaning of the story as a whole. Also, the graphic content is one that not all readers will be able to handle or relate to. Despite this, When Day Meets Night is a unique novel and Nanji could possibly be the new voice for young, urban authors that are on the rise.<br />Reviewed by: Kanika (Nika) Wade	2002-09-27
Smooth & Refreshing	Bonnie's life was already filled to capacity, as she was the primary caregiver for her grandchild, principal of a school, and the closest thing to a relative for Suzie. She didn't need the extra strain and desire Ray bestowed upon her when he decided he was smitten with her. Nevertheless, Bonnie hadn't dated in...well, she couldn't remember when. But the existing stresses in her life were already too much for her to contend with, so how could she find the energy to reciprocate Ray's lure?<br />Ray didn't have much to do with women after his wife of 20 years blindsided him two months before he was to retire from the army. That experience left an acrid echo in his mind and heart. But there was something about Bonnie...was it her mellifluous voice? Ray likes to feel needed, so was it the unharmonious mixture of distress and determination that seemed to ooze from her pores? Whatever it was, it drew him to her like a bibliophile to a library. But Bonnie flies solo. She has extraneous things sucking the life out of her, namely her estranged daughter and cantankerous grandchild. Can Ray weather the storms? Will Ray allow Bonnie's tumultuous life and standoffish demeanor to deter him? Will Bonnie let Ray into her carefully woven world?<br />What I liked most about Everything In Its Place was that Ray & Bonnie's courtship was comforting and relaxing. Sure, they had obstacles and walls to scale; however, they didn't have the melodramatic scenes, actions, and consequences that accompany much younger couples in other stories I've read. Realism rang throughout the story in such an honest, fervent tone...subdued, yet potent. Palfrey's experienced and soothing tone glides you through the story, and before you know it, you are finished or you've stayed up too late trying to finish.<br />Palfrey laced her mature romance with mystery and intrigue; two very appealing ingredients. Her descriptions and characters are vibrant. She writes with impressive aplomb and knowledge. I really enjoyed Everything In Its Place, and I am sure that you will too. I'm looking forward to Palfrey's next novel.<br />-Reviewed by Miss Lovenjoyed Everything In Its Place, and I am sure that you will too.

A hidden agenda...4.5 Stars	Holding Out for a Hero is an intriguing Romantic Mystery set in<br />Planet Hollywood amidst the glitz and glamour of the entertainment<br />world. It is also a story about filling the empty lives that seem<br />so prevalent once the spotlights are turned off.<br />Actor Billy Prescott is changing his life style and is trying to<br />reconnect with his former fianc&eacute;e and fellow actress Samantha<br />Hathaway.  But Billy's overt lifestyle is more than Sam can tolerate,<br />she has had enough.  Before she can share her feelings with Billy,<br />his life is tragically snuffed out in an automobile accident.

Adam travels to California under the<br />guise of consulting with Sam on her role in her upcoming movie. But<br />Adam has another motive, and  though he went as an officer of the<br />law, he finds himself cast in the role of his life.<br />This is Ms. Savoy's first Romantic Mystery and as with her previous<br />works, it will have readers anxiously anticipating the ending. The<br />supporting cast is an excellent addition and they are strategically<br />placed throughout the story. One added twist is the family<br />relationship that exists between the characters, it makes a reader<br />eager to see what fruit fell from which tree. This book was completed<br />after September 11, and it touched briefly on that horriffic tragedy,<br />and on the heroes that rose from the ashes.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-09-20
Learning to Love	Jacquelin Thomas has outdone herself with her Contemporary Romance, With A Song In My Heart.  It's a wonderful page-turner mixed with some intrigue and outright romantic entanglement. I really enjoyed this book.<br />Elle Ransom is in love with Brennan Cunningham III.  After being together for a while, Elle proclaims her love to Brennan after a night of passionate lovemaking, but it's too much for him to handle, so he skips out in the middle of the night leaving Elle alone and unbeknown to them both, pregnant.<br />A month later, Brennan resurfaces at Elle's brother's wedding. When she talks to Brennan, he acts as if nothing happened between them. She decides not to tell him about her pregnancy, but he finds out from her co-worker.<br />Brennan was raised in a loveless household filtered with upper class social status and was never afforded a loving family life. Therefore, his take on love is simple, no commitments.  Elle's upbringing was totally opposite because she was raised in a large, loving family environment. Her take on love is simple, honesty, with love and committment. Brennan and Elle's turmoil in making the right decisions for the sake of their baby is further complicated when a  part of Brennan's past catches up with him. Now he is faced with two dilemmas.<br />What Jacquelin Thomas does in \\"With A Song In My Heart\\" is take it all to another level. The plot enhancement throughout the story paved the way for a daring climax with a surprise ending.  I highly recommend this book and declare this is indeed one of Jacquelin Thomas' best works.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2002-09-18
Splendid Sequel	Have you ever ached for unconditional love? Do you hold your soulmate in your arms at night or in your dreams? The sizzling sequel to Soul Mates Dissipates addresses Jada's search for unconditional love and Wellington's ache for his soul mate. After twenty years, the magnetic attraction they shared in their early twenties still exists.<br />In `Never Again Once More', we catch up with a mature Jada and Wellington. They shed the brazen carelessness they enjoyed as young adults, embraced middle age with sophistication, and usurped parenthood with zeal. I really enjoyed witnessing the evolution Jada and Wellington experienced. Although they extended their best efforts to avoid chaos, Jada and Wellington still nurtured secrets and emotions that erupted, and caused distress for them and their extensions.<br />The novel occurs over a 20 year span of time. It picks up at the end of Soul Mates Dissipates, and moves forward. I was initially very frustrated and confused with time elements. We were led back and forth through time, so occasionally I was disoriented and had no idea in which decade things were taking place. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the story, which is thick with the tension and drama that heightens your curiosity and stimulates anxiety. So, take care when you start reading because you may not want to stop until you reach the last page.<br />-Reviewed by Miss Love	2002-09-18
Beautiful Poetry from an author on the rise	Over the years, we have been blessed with many poets who have moved us. From Langston Hughes to Maya Angelou, these poets have made us laugh, cry, and smile with their works that have touched us to the inner depths of our souls. There is another poet that can be added to this growing list: Latorial Faison.

New Age Objectivity	Out of the mouths of Hip Hop artists come intellectual quotes that make you wonder did they actually say that. Dropping' Science: Straight-Up Talk from Hip Hop's Greatest Voices edited by Denise L. McIver makes you drop your mouth and take a second look.<br />Straight up talk is an understatement of what you will read in Ms. McIver's book.  She quotes various Hip Hop artists on every phase of life. From self-esteem, truth, passion, power & respect, and love & sex, to staying on the right path. You will truly be amazed at the rationale of our top Hip Hop performers.<br />Although there are some quotes which made me want to scream or jump in their faces to say, \\"oh no you didn't say that,\\" and some that had me smiling and thinking she/he is really deep.  Dropping Science demonstrates how everyone looks at society and life differently.  Ms. McIver takes you through various topics highlighting the performer's perception of life. Many of them have successfully carved out a niche making them rich and highly respected among the younger generation. Several of their quotes reflect on their upbringing, support from family and friends,  the struggles, and doing things that were not morally correct. Their honesty is truly reflected and appreciated.<br />After reading the book, my first thoughts were \\"why don't they reflect that in their music sometimes?\\"  But who is to say they are not reflecting those same sentiments through song and music. It's time for the older generation to take a moment and really listen to their words, myself included. The Hip Hop culture has truly come full circle and I have to applaud Ms. McIver for opening the door through her book for the misunderstood to finally be more objective to understand this rising culture.<br />You enjoy their music, yet you don't really know what goes on in their minds. Well take a moment and read Droppin Science because it's definitely a great educational guide allowing you to see the other side of artists such as Mary J. Blige, LL Cool J, Will Smith, Bow-Bow, and  Ja-Rule just to name a few. They along with the other artists will have you thinking and looking at society issues from a different perspective.<br />The book is unique, colorful, informative, yet original, and definitely an eye-opener.

What does it take to get ahead?	Office romance, backstabbing, promotions and firings, Wanda Moorman's novel Corporate Sponsor has it all.  Kimberly Keaton is a woman who is committed to her job and has a strong work ethic.  Lately, she has been becoming more and more stressed, not because of her workload but rather because of the work environment at Stapleton Enterprises.<br />This book has a fresh plot and was an enjoyable read.  Corporate Sponsor highlighted some of the difficulties that African American women and women in general encounter when working in a corporate environment.  In addition, we learn about the personal lives of many of the characters as they develop friendships and intimate relationships.  Although there were a number of important characters in this book, the author did a wonderful job developing each character just enough so that we understood their role in the book and without going too far.<br />This book has a little something for everyone from romance to deceit.

Through The Flames	Life has never been easy for Charlotte Russell Johnson. As a child she was overweight, had low self esteem issues and grew up in a single parent home. As she came upon her teenage years Charlotte blossomed into a beautiful young woman. She was very intelligent at an early age and had the tools to achieve whatever goals and dreams she had in mind. Charlotte had one major downfall, herself. She liked to take walks on the wild side and that often got her into trouble.<br />With her intelligence and book smarts Charlotte just knew that one day she would go to college. Instead she fell into a world of drugs, pregnancy, prison and despair. Her penchant for trouble led her to a very bad situation that would forever change the course of her life.<br /> A Journey To Hell and Back by author Charlotte Russell Johnson is filled with pain and hope. The author is very honest and up front about the bad choices that she has made in life. She also shows that she has overcome her troubles and has become a productive member of society. My only complaint about this book was repetition. Throughout the story the author kept referring to certain events over and over again and that proved to be distracting. After reading her story I have tremendous respect for Charlotte Russell Johnson and wish her well with her life and any future projects.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-09-18

Myst&egrave;re Noir	Aimee  DuBois is a thirty-something black journalist living in the French Quarter of New Orleans and operating the city's black rag. When a young man dies on the steps of one of the local high schools, Aimee takes it upon herself to find out the truth about what happened. She goes to the ghetto looking for answers, but ends up finding much more.<br />  N is told in a most innovative narrative style.  Switching back and forth from the film noir style to the voice of Aimee, Edwards captures the reader with strong symbolism and living, breathing characters.  When I first heard about this book, the one letter title intrigued me, but I was left satisfied and enlightened as I moved through the book. The recurring theme of N is tightly and believeably wrapped up in a surprise ending, one of the critical things I think makes a mystery novel a mystery novel.  Edwards gives us more than just the run of the mill mystery, however. Laced with romance, family themes, and discovery, N is a novel to be absorbed and pondered; not simply read and forgotten.<br />~Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-08-25
By Any Means	Illegal Affairs is an engrossing and unbelievable tale of four adults enrolled in a fictitious African-American law school in Dallas, Texas.  Taking on an almost soap opera flair, Illegal Affairs is a compelling and page turning novel that had this reader shaking her head wondering why.  Why do we deceive, betray and purposely hurt each other and why do we allow the insecurities and jealousies of our psyche to potentially destroy a person we consider a friend?<br />Harvey opens the novel with a titillating finale-a conversation between a mother and daughter whose relationship is strained at best and volatile at its worst. It was not long into the novel that it becomes apparent as to whom the players were in the finale; This was a clever technique utilizing an ending, which is actually a beginning. The students, Callie, Raven, Omar and Keith, each arrived at Monroe Law School with baggage, but also with the determination to make it through.  Harvey did an excellent job of providing their background so we understood what made them tick.  Add two additional characters and you have a possible discussion of issues dealing with race relations and its impact in our society.<br />What made this a compelling read were the antics that the characters involved themselves with and their justifications of them. But one of the most redeeming qualities of this novel is the portrayal of giving back and lending a hand to those in need.  Furthermore, the commentary, coupled with the mystique of law and the rigid law school studies was very informative. This was a very good mystery novel that leads to a follow up that I anxiously await.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-08-25

She has survived her<br />stagnant life by living  vicariously, so fantasizing about Skye<br />comes easy.<br />The premise of the story is excellent, and though I could not really<br />embrace the characters, the real strength of this particular story<br />lives in Ms. Griffin's ability to tug at our family emotions, as well<br />as make us stop and ask ourselves if we are really able to give up our<br />personal goals for the sake of family? This is a real underdog story<br />but she  did not allow the character to wallow in self-pity.

Do you believe in the Supernatural?	I have heard many stories over the years about how the belief in the Supernatural is second nature to most southern African Americans.  Reading this book made me question my belief in the existence of the Supernatural.<br />The Winds of Destiny written by noted author Willie Tee is a thought provoking and engaging book based on past true-life events in the author's family.  The story setting is on a farm in North Carolina near Wilmington in the 1950s.  Uncle Leon, the author's favorite uncle, was reared on this farm.  The story opens during the tragic death of Uncle Leon in a trucking accident.  There is a deep dark family secret that if revealed could affect the entire family.  Coupled with beliefs in voodoo and witchcraft this novel takes suspense to a new level.<br />Uncle Leon was a man who loved life and encouraged everyone around him to live life to the fullest.  Pa Daddy and Granny were Leon's parents.  Granny was a strong black woman who helped to hold her family together.  Pa Daddy was a strict and rigid man who believed that everyone should work.<br />Tee's true family story is one of great suspense.  The scenes where voodoo was practiced were so descriptive.  I cried and laughed while reading this book.  I loved Granny for her strength and wisdom.  Uncle Leon was my favorite character.  This is one story you will always remember.  Mr. Tee, I cannot wait to read the sequel.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading true-life stories filled with suspense.

Looking at the Man in the Mirror	Take a trip to Senegal with Bertrand, an African-American anthropologist gathering urban folktales for his dissertation. What seems like a routine  field trip for collecting information and material turns into a journey of self-examination. Bertrand struggles with his marriage to a white woman. He scrutinizes the intention of his would-be friendships in Senegal. He learns first hand that things aren't always what they seem. He sleeps.<br />Coming into contact with a part of his psyche long buried, Bertrand takes stock of why he has become who he is and why he has done the things he has done.  His once dreamless sleep turns into a vivid display of his relationships and emotions.<br />  He Sleeps is not your typical &quot;man on a pilgrimage&quot; tale.  Fashioned ornately with descriptive imagery and latent characterization of a likeable protagonist, He Sleeps proceeds to capture the reader with intensity.  McKnight has a way of telling a story that is, at the same time, engaging and stark. He is able to relate Bertrand's story in the manner of an urban folktale of sorts.  An exceptional book that monopolizes the reader's attention.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-08-15

Poetry in spirit	I have never read poetry like the book Journey To TimbookTu edited by Memphis Vaughn, Jr.  This book is a magnificent collection of poems and essays featuring over 75 poets and writers.<br />The Journey To TimbookTu begins with the introduction.  Vaughn gives us some history on how the book was developed.  It's interesting to note how Vaughn's desire to pay homage to great African Empires and cultures led to the name TimBookTu.  The motherland is at the heart of this poetic journey.  This is one journey all African Americans can relate to.  There is power in the words of these poetic expressions.  You can feel the spirit of the book as you read.  It's like going on a trip but never leaving home.<br />Vaughn's essay on The Last Resort is awesome.  It reads like a short fictional story.  The poets and essayists who contributed to the journey are to be commended for writing a collection of soul felt poetic expressions.<br />It took me several days to read this book but what impressed me the most were the poems.  The poems are truly a reflection of African American experiences.  I recommend that you visit the author's website and buy the book.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2002-08-15
American History at its best	Having Our Say is a remarkable book written by Sadie and Bessie Delany that details their lives over a hundred year period.<br />Bessie and Sadie grew up in a large family on the campus of Saint Augustine's school in Raleigh, North Carolina during the 90s.  They led sheltered lives; Sadie was quiet and well mannered whereas Bessie was very quick to anger and opinionated.  They were also very intelligent women who were taught early on to aim high.  In a time when most people did not go to school beyond high school, Bessie and Sadie received college degrees.  Bessie became the second black woman to practice dentistry in New York.<br />Sadie became the first black home economics teacher in a New York high school. The Delany sisters spoke their minds, and what they give the reader is a story of pure American history.<br />This autobiography is filled with stories about racism and how it affected their lives.  Sadie and Bessie lived together for over a hundred years.  Although the sisters are deceased, their story and words of wisdom live on in the hearts and minds of readers.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in American History.  This book is the best history book I've read and the pictures in the book make the story come alive.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2002-08-15
A daughter's love	Ilyasah Shabazz is the third daughter of the late Malcolm X and the late Dr. Betty Shabazz, though she is the daughter of history she is still very much her own person. Ilayasah has five sisters they are Gamilah, Attallah, Quibilah and the twins Malikah and Malaak.<br /> Malcolm X is a figure that the world has come to know through movies and books. Dr. Betty Shabazz was seen as the noble widow of Malcolm and was known for her strength and philanthropy, but not much was ever known of their children. In Growing Up X, Ilayasah Shabazz offers a rare glimpse into how her famous parents affected her life.<br /> On the that Malcolm X was assasinated, Betty and her four children were present, at the time of Malcoms death Betty was pregnant with the twins. Even though Ilayasah does not recall much of what happened, it has deeply affected her family. For a long time she did not understand why her father was not coming home, and why her mother often had to struggle to take care of her six children.<br /> As Ilayasah began to grow up and leave the shelter of home she discovered that her father was no ordinary man. Some people loved him, some hated him, and because she was his daughter she was always held to a higher standard. While in college many black students expected her to be a revolutionary and all she wanted to do was go to school. This would be a problem that Ilayasah would face often but she always handled it with the dignity and grace that her mother Betty instilled in her.<br /> This book was wonderful because you were able to see what happened to the Shabazz family after the death of Malcolm and how, through the leadership and strength of Betty, all six of her daughters grew to be strong, proud black women. The strength instilled by their mother was very important because many years later Betty would die as the result of a horrible fire, and they would need strength and faith to get them through the loss.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Everyone has a story	Everyone has something in their past that they would like to change, but what can be done with the baggage?  Is it held onto as a secret, with a daily prayer that it isn't found out or do you let it go and use it as a personal testimony to show others where God has brought you from?  This is a central theme in Felicia Mason's novel Testimony.<br />From the moment you start this book, you get a sense that things are not quite as they seem.  The Triumphant Voices of Praise and their director, Roger,  are going on a tour that will hopefully help them garner the national acclaim that has been out of reach for so long.  Through the course of the book the reader follows the choir's tour and the events that follow.  In the process, we get to know several of the characters on a more personal level and discover the secrets that they are hiding.  We see the choir members struggle to become a better group, but also to become better Christians.<br />This was my first book by Felicia Mason, but it will definitely not be my last.  I am so impressed with how she brought a fresh new voice to the world of Christian Fiction.  The plot of this story moved beyond the typical relationship issues while delving into serious emotional and personal issues.  Mason keeps the plot flowing as she reveals secrets and introduces all kinds of twists and turns in the plot.  Will the characters chose to follow God's plan for their lives or continue trying to do their own thing?  Check out Testimony and find out for yourself.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-08-15

The fall semester is filled with tragedy and drama and spring semester is filled with pain; all these happenings rock Donavin and company to the core.<br /> That's The Way Love Goes is basically a pretty good book. It has a great storyline and is for the most part very realistic. However, I had one huge problem with the book, and that was the character J.R. I realize that his character is from Louisiana and that he is supposed to have a southern accent but I felt it was over the top. I could not understand half of what J.R. said and sometimes had to read passages over again or aloud to understand what he was talking about. J.R.'s dialect disrupted the flow of the story for me.

A Very Elegantly told Mystery	It is very rare that I read novels whose setting occurs before I was born in 1970; however, Harlem Redux was so well written that I wasn't conscious of the excellent history lessons I received as I enjoyed the novel. Persia Walker places our minds and imaginations into a Time Machine, where she uses her words, imagery, and mystery to transport us back into time. We land in Harlem circa the 1920s, where the black social elite inhabit Strivers Row. Safe, secluded, and tucked away from the mars of the black lower class.<br />An engaging and intoxicating mystery. David disappeared from his family's prominent home on Strivers Row. His sister, Lilian's, untimely and suspicious death prompted his return. David's suspicions about his sister's death has him remaining in Harlem longer than he anticipated. Not good. You see, David has a secret of his own that he doesn't want revealed.<br />Harlem Redux addresses disputes among African Americans and between African Americans and Caucasians. We get a history lesson and an eclectic view of Harlem in the 1920s. Inner-racial prejudice and racial division are skirted, but the big issue is WHO DID IT? You'll enjoy the ride as David pounds the pavement and browbeats everyone available. He is determined to get the truth about his sister's death.<br />Persia did an excellent job of having the novel set in history, but still making the story interesting. Her vibrant descriptions provide luscious scenery of historical Strivers Row. The characters were a splendid array of black aristocracy, peasants, elitist, and elite wanna bees. I love the way the story unfolds...you think you've figured everything out, only to be presented with more mystery on something else, utterly dispelling your previous hypothesis.

What Makes a Woman a Woman?	Nicole Kurtz's debut novel addresses a variety of issues that many women deal with. Insecurity, miscarriages, infidelity, teen motherhood, interracial relationships, and trust are just a few of the topics A Complete Woman tackles.  One might think this is an ambitious number of problems for a 140 page book, but Kurtz pulls it off, blending the issues of her characters into the plotline with tact and fluidity.  She tells the story through the eyes of the main character, Tracy, with segues to the flashbacks of both Tracy and her friends.<br />Each of the characters struggle with her own issues, and each of their stories capture the essence of their personalities.  There were some scenes so vivid, I felt like I was in the room, a fly on the wall, watching the scene unfold. A Complete Woman is a compelling read that confronts what it is to each of us to be a &quot;complete woman&quot;, with a recurring theme and ultimate bottom line of self-love.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-07-30
Who is the lawyerï&iquest;½s son?	The Lawyers Son begins as the Taylor family is making a big move.  Mike Taylor had recently received a promotion and as a result of the additional income, he was able to move his family to a new, more elite community.  To say that Mike and his wife Lisa were thrilled about the move would be an understatement.  Their only concern was on how they as an African American family would be accepted into a predominately white, affluent community.  However, their teenaged son Jason, an excellent student, star baseball player and aspiring DJ, is just about to begin his senior year in high school and he is not looking forward to starting at a new school and moving away from his long time friends.<br />The day after the move, Jason meets Brad and the two quickly discover that not only are they the same age, but that they also share a number of common interests.  Soon after, Lisa and Mike meet Brads parents Rachel and Tom, and the two families quickly develop a special friendship in spite of their cultural differences.  In addition, Mike, a structural engineer, and Tom, a lawyer, were able to forge a professional relationship.  Throughout the book, we follow the two families over the next couple of years and as readers, we are able to watch the various relationships grow and develop until we reach the books final, dramatic climax.<br />The Lawyers Son was a quick and engaging read, but the title was a bit misleading.  Brad, the lawyers son, plays a pivotal role in the plot, yet it seemed that he was the least developed character.  I would have liked to have seen more about him throughout the book so that his decisions and actions at the end would have been better understood.  As I read this novel, I found myself asking How difficult is it to overcome racial differences and forge meaningful friendships?  Ultimately, this is a novel about loyalties, betrayals and difficult choices; and deciding whether or not one should stand by their moral support their family unconditionally.  The Lawyers Son addresses issues of love, friendship, acceptance and race through a cast of interesting characters and enough questions to keep the reader engaged and curious.  Its unique plot was a refreshing change and I am certain that William Jaman Taylor is an author to watch.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seayily unconditionally.

Back with a Vengeance	Easy Rawlins is back with a vengeance. He is not the same person though; he has lost his closest friend and feels that he will never recover from the hurt. Easy has settled into life as a family man, with a normal 9-5 job and a paycheck at the end of the week. In his opinion, his days as the unconventional private detective Easy Rawlins are well behind him.<br /> One day out of the blue Easy gets a call from his old friend John, it turns out that John's stepson Brawley Brown has disappeared and is running with members of a radical political group. Brawley's parents feel that  he is entangled in a web of violence and will be harmed in the process. John has always helped Easy without question, so even though Easy doesn't want to look for Brawley, he does.<br /> As Easy begins his investigation, he finds himself in the midst of danger. He also discovers that this case is about much more than locating Brawley and returning him home. People in this novel are not always who or what they portray themselves to be.<br /> Life for Easy goes beyond being a private detective. In addition to the difficult case, he is dealing with potential problems brewing at home concerning his children. Also the loss of his best friend is on Easy's mind daily and sometimes overwhelms him.<br /> Bad Boy Brawley Brown is an intriguing mystery that keeps you guessing. Just when you think you know who the villain is, author Walter Mosley throws a curve ball that will have you thinking otherwise, and in my opinion that makes for the best stories of mystery. I must confess this is my first Walter Mosley novel, but it will not be my last because I enjoyed it. I highly recommend this book.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-07-30

Making a Family	It is often said that being a parent is no easy task.  So just imagine the difficulties involved with raising a child that is not your own.  Further complicate matters by raising a child that is the son or daughter of a relative, and now you have a challenge.  This is the task that Rene Parson and her husband Mark took on when they decided to become the foster parents of her two nephews, Deron and Jeff.  The decision to raise the boys was because of her sister's inability to raise the children herself as a result of her drug addiction and the lifestyle that goes along with being an addict.<br />The Parson's faced any number of challenges along the way but their faith in God provided the strength they needed to provide to the best of their ability, the care that the boys could not get from their own mother.  The book profiles the difficulties of relative foster parenting, using their own life as the example.  Further, the book explores how the children's lives were impacted by the continued substance abuse on the part of their mother.  While this book is not a \\"happy\\" read it is a necessary one because it makes everyone more aware of the challenges that are faced by many youth in this country.<br />Parson shares how the foster parenting impacted her relationship with her husband and siblings (especially her sister, Deron and Jeff's mom).  But more importantly, she shares Deron and Jeff's story.  As I read about the adversities that these boys have encountered in their short lives, I could only shake my head in disbelief.<br />Rene and Mark Parson are truly an inspiration.  As I read this book, I was moved by their deep commitment to God and the great effort they went through to encourage the two boys to develop a relationship with God.  I was further moved be the challenges that she and her husband faced as foster parents, and those that the two boys faces as a result of being foster children.  I respected Rene and Mark for not choosing to do what was easy, instead choosing to do what they felt would be best for the boys.  This is an emotional read, it will have you cheering one minute and tearing up the next.  I highly recommend this book and especially recommend it for anyone that works in a profession relation to, or has an interest in child welfare.-Reviewed by Stacey Seayoosing to do what they felt would be best for the boys.

Life for Vanessa has not always been easy. She was raised in various foster homes and she often felt incomplete because she did not have a family. She had Chris and Reina, but they were not her blood relations. Because of her past, Vanessa had issues with containing her anger, and she often took the pain and resentment she had towards her birth parents out on others.<br /> Chris McCullen is an attractive and well put together man. He is financially stable and is a pretty good guy. Some might say that Chris has it all. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Chris is haunted daily by the mysterious death of his mother which occured when he was just a child. Due to past, experiences Chris has put a padlock on his heart, vowing that he would never again let a woman hurt him.<br /> Reina Kingsley is a very unique and complicated person. She is half-Puerto Rican and half-Jamaican, and has very strict and traditional parents. She has suffered with self-esteem issues for years, and even though she is close to Vanessa she has made food her best friend. Over the years, Reina has gained a lot of weight. The weight gain has not only led to depression, but has also pushed her away from her love of singing.<br /> Living on the Edge of Respectability by Suzette D. Harrison is not the typical relationship novel. Sure there are romance and relationship issues, but it goes deeper than that.

Also, he beautifully intertwines the September 11 tragedy and the death of R & B singer Aaliyah into the storyline and portrays them with compassion and accuracy. As a reader it was very interesting to see how these two tragic events affected Raymond, Zola and the people around them.<br /> A Love Of My Own was a wonderful book.

Antioch has been Ruth's church home since she was a child, and now that she has divorced the pastor she is considered an outcast. Though the church members go out of their way to make her feel uncomfortable, Ruth stays on in her capacity as the church organist just to make life difficult for the pastor and the congregation.<br /><br /> The end of her marriage has forced Ruth to take a long, hard look at herself. She is angry, struggling financially and is feeling lost and alone. Ruth has also begun to face the reality that she is severely overweight and is extremely unhappy with herself.<br /> One Sunday during church, Ruth spots the unlikely man of her dreams, Dewey Baxter. Dewey Baxter is a big, homegrown farm boy, who is a father struggling to raise his two children. The children are Tee and Dee. Tee is an energetic and headstrong little girl who always speaks her mind; Dee is a quiet, reserved little boy who seems to have some deep rooted emotional issues. Ruth and Dewey are as different as night and day, and have some cultural differences. Ruth is black and Dewey is white and the small town community that they live in can often be narrow- minded. Ruth is half white and wants to explore the other side of her heritage.<br /> Ruth is a strong woman, but the mere thought of Dewey and his children makes her weak in the knees because she is so overwhelmed with love for them. Author J.J. Murray has outdone himself with his latest work, Something Real. He has written a realistic story that could happen to anyone. Divorce, betrayal, strength and pain are things that occur on a daily basis and he made you feel everything that the character was feeling or thinking. I highly recommend that you get a dose of reality and read Something Real.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-07-30

Town Meeting - A Portrait	Rattlebone, Kansas. Circa 1950. A group of related short stories paints a picture of the town of Rattlebone, Kansas and its inhabitants. Driven by strong characterizations, Maxine Clair's Rattlebone introduces us to Irene, a young girl living there as she grows, experiences, and blooms.  Other notable characters include the Red Quanders, a group of people living together in a kinship environment, reminiscent of Igbo and other West African traditionalists, October Brown, Irene's grade school teacher, and Nick, Irene's introduction to love and all things pre-pubescent.<br /> In essence, the tales tell two sides to every story, first relaying how a character is perceived by others and also how a character perceives himself or herself.  The stories and characters all tie together if they do not pronounce themselves with novel-like fluency. Clair even continues a character's (October Brown) story in her second fiction title, October Suite.  Each of these stories has its own moral, its own personality, its own undercurrent of emotion and is, thus, worthy of any reader's attention.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-07-30

I enjoyed this story and believe that you will enjoy it as well.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-07-08
Where the Heart Is	Yolanda Young tells her story of coming of age in Shreveport, Louisiana, with radiance and charm.  Each of the chapters profiles a specific era in Young's life, ranging from her first time in the woods picking strawberries to the horror of her father shooting her mother several times.  We meet lively relatives -- some wise and cheerful, others downright despicable. We follow &quot;Londa&quot; from her informative grade school years to her preppy-obsessed high school era.<br />It seems as though in On Our Way to Beautiful not only is Young telling the reader her childhood memories, but also life lessons she learned. She passes on the wisdom she acquired during her formative years. The writing is as brilliantly colored as Big Momma's quilts she so acutely describes, and through captivating storytelling, vivid imagery, and eminent emotion, the reader will, without a doubt, find beauty in this author as well as in her story.<br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-07-08
A Long and Laborious Journey	When I began reading The Road South, I had no idea who this man Shelly Stewart was or what to expect from his memoir.  What I discovered was the story of a man of humble and difficult beginnings, a survivor of some of the most brutal child abuse imaginable, an exemplary student, and a man of pride and big dreams.  Stewart was not afraid to speak out for the civil rights of Blacks in the South, often standing alone and putting his own life in jeopardy to do so.  He also established himself as a successful radio personality and has established himself as a force in the field of communications.  Ultimately, Shelly Stewart is a man that has spent his entire life chasing the dream of a loving, healthy and close knit family.<br />Saying that Shelly Stewart survived a difficult childhood would be a major understatement.  Shelly and his three brothers witnessed, experienced and endured things that no human being, let alone a child, should ever have to encounter.  However, even as a child, Shelly made a conscious decision not to let his early life keep him down.  Shelly Stewart exemplifies resilience.  He was a man that had any number of things going against him but persevered in spite of the circumstances around him and was never afraid to dream.  As a result, he has benefited from successful careers in radio and the field of communications.  This book is not for the faint of heart; as I read Stewart's descriptions of his early life there were times when I wanted to cry and others where I felt physically ill.  The abuse that he and his brothers survived cannot easily be put into words.  What I respected most about Stewart was that even though he was victimized he never came across as a victim because he openly and honestly acknowledges and takes responsibility for his own mistakes.  This is a moving and emotional memoir that extends far beyond a sharing of historical and political information and eloquently captures a story of personal triumph and disappointment.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seaywed by Stacey Seay	2002-07-08

Rashaun Jones is defending one of<br />his best friends who has been accused of murder with a<br />lethal weapon.

Sister to Sister	Sister Wit by Jacqueline Jakes is one of the most spiritually uplifting devotions for women that I've read.  Jakes is the sister of well-known author and speaker Bishop T. D. Jakes.  This powerful devotional is Jakes' testimonial.  At the request of her brother the idea for this book was born.  Jakes shares her unique experiences of life with women. At age twenty Jakes suffered a life-threatening experience.  She was diagnosed with a brain tumor.  The road to recovery was long and difficult but Jakes held on to her faith for strength and courage.<br />Sister Wit is an inspiration to all women.  Packed with Bible scriptures and quotes from ordinary people this book delivers positive messages.  The devotionals are Jakes' secrets about her unique life experiences and the wisdom she gained.  In one devotional she writes about \\"My Missed Opportunity.\\"  Shirley Caesar writes the quote that goes with the devotional.  \\"I always had only one prayer:  \\"Lord just crack the door a little and I'll kick it open all the way.\\"<br />I found Sister Wit to be so real.  The book was not preachy but inspirational and thought provoking.  I recommend this book to all women who face everyday life struggles...	2002-06-27
A Different Look	C. F. Hawthorne demonstrates the ability to tell an age-old story in an innovative way. For years Annie has endured physical and verbal abuse as a child and as an adult.  Enter Febe, Annie's alter ego, who is there to protect her and to give her the courage to fight back and you have a story that is so over the top you have to wonder if you're dealing with reality.<br />Utilizing engrossing and compassionate characters, Hawthorne gives us an interesting look at the results of domestic violence.  Annie not only struggles with the physical scars and pain of the abuse, but she is constantly fighting with Febe and her revenge factor.  Febe struggles with a strong and confident personality that puts her and others in dangerous situations. Mixed together, you have two very different personalities who are always at odds with each other.<br />Hawthorne can definitely tell a story in a very unconventional way.  This is a very good, affective and graphic story that will have you feeling for each character and their struggles. -- Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-06-27
And from the darkness shall come light	Not every book has the ability to affect the reader as deeply as Walk Through Darkness affected me.  David Anthony Durham, author of the critically acclaimed Gabriel's Story, has written a haunting novel about William, a fugitive slave.  One may surmise that the force behind William's escape is freedom. Freedom is, of course, part of the reason William flees his harsh laborious conditions. But even moreso is his desire to find Dover, his wife, who is pregnant with his child and has moved North to freedom with her mistress.  The story alternates between William's point of view and Morrison's, a Scottish slave tracker.  Somehow these three people, who are separated by miles and life experience, are connected.<br />  Durham's writing is refined, articulate, and descriptive. He makes you feel the fear, terror, relief, pain, joy, and a plethora of other emotions felt by the protagonists.  The characters are in no way shallow, instead powerfully constructed with a certain profundity.  The author uses a historical setting and breathes new life into it, providing the reader with a raw, fresh story in lands never traversed.  Transcending race, time, and status, this Walk Through Darkness will make anyone see the light...	2002-06-27
Eventually, you get tired of running...	An injury stalled and eventually ended Dell Fletchers' pro baseball career. Affectionately nicknamed the Roadrunner, Dell is having difficulty not playing baseball; no longer the big star in the limelight. Dell's devoted wife Leah has lost patience with Dell's detachment from the family; his addiction to pain killers; and his aggravating disappearing acts. One morning Leah and Dell have a belligerent argument. Uncharacteristically, Dell strikes Leah. This sets into motion a series of tumultuous events, one of which is Dell's frightening and lengthy disappearance. The story contains clever plot twists boiling with lies and deceit that could rip the Fletcher family to shreds.<br />I didn't know what to expect from Trisha R Thomas' sophomore novel. What I got was an intriguing explosion of mystery and excitement. The journey through Roadrunner is racy and rousing. My senses were peaked throughout the novel. Trisha wastes no time raising the tension, establishing the conflict, and delivering a cunning, sexy antagonist.<br />We are privy to the thoughts of all the main characters, which heightens anxiety. There was never a dull moment. Reading Roadrunner was like watching an Aaron Spelling sitcom...sexual tension, endless emotions, distressed divas, and pestering psychos.<br />The characters and plot are pasted to my memory. Leah, Dell, Josh, Kayla, and Angel hold nothing back...Their inner turmoil, bliss, loyalty, and love is integral to the story. Their raw candor drew me in captivating my attention until the last page.<br />Roadrunner is a racing and rousing novel about familial love, fatal passion, and commitment. When you finish reading Roadrunner, you'll wish it was a weekly sitcom, just like I did; Consequently, we know that all good things eventually end. -- Reviewed by KaTrina Love (MissLove)	2002-06-25
A Final Song	We began following the life of Maya Angelou through her first biography, \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\\" Now many years and several installments later we conclude with her latest work \\"A Song Flung Up to Heaven.\\"  Although, Angelou focuses primarily on a short span of her life in this book, she reflects over her entire life and at the end of the book the reader will surely feel as if she has come full circle.<br />Angelou's path to success was a rocky one.  As a child she was the victim of abuse and her young adult life was far from easy.  She shares her experiences with candor and grace, I never felt as if she was telling the glamorized version of her experiences.  She shared both her triumphs and her regrets, her successes and her failures.  Her writing was conversational, and as I read through this book I felt at times as if we were sitting and chatting.  Maya's relationships with such figures as Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and Martin Luther King Jr., were discussed at length in this novel and several other famous figures were featured with less detail.  I appreciated that she didn't \\"dish dirt\\" about these people, instead she portrayed the people behind the work for which they were famous.<br />This book continued the journey of Angelou's often difficult life, but I felt like I was left hanging.  I respect her decision not to write about writing, but after reading about so many of the difficulties she had to overcome in her life I wanted to hear about her ultimate success as a writer.  Still, I appreciated her openness and willingness to share her life's arduous journey with readers.  I truly believe that her life symbolizes strength of character and perseverance in a manner that should serve as an inspiration to all, and particularly to women.  As such, I highly recommend Maya Angelou's final chapter of her collection of memoirs.--Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-06-22

Who is Prisoner number 14?	From the very first page of The Nomination, you will find yourself asking questions.  Slowly, Williams weaves a tale that will ultimately provide the answers you are seeking.  The book opens with an election celebration party. As a result of the election, new political opportunities emerge for several African American politicians.<br />Through this enjoyable novel, Williams addresses a myriad of serious political issues, especially those relating to African Americans.  He also explores such issues as crime, substance abuse, and family values.  Ultimately, this is a story about choices and sacrifices that will have you wondering whether political success is worth it's price tag.  I was impressed by how well the author was able to demonstrate how the character's personal lives were influenced by their career choices or the career choices of family members.  I also appreciated the fact that although this book had it's share of scandal and characters that seemingly did not have a moral bone in their body, the author also included a primary character that acted on his beliefs and values.  This provided a wonderful balance among the male characters in the book.  The only thing I disliked about the book was the fact that there were so many weak female characters.  In spite of this, I felt I could understand, relate to and feel for all the characters in some way.<br />Williams has written a sharp political mystery that is indeed a page turner.  It is pleasant to read  a political novel featuring a cast of African American characters.  Even though this was a work of fiction, I felt as if I got an inside look at what African American political life is like.  Read this book with caution, because once you pick it up you will not want to put it down until you have read the last page.<br />-Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-06-22

Fact or Fiction	When you hear the word Amityville, you probably think of the movie The Amityville Horror. The movie is actually the story of George and Kathy Lutz and their family after moving into a house said to be haunted by ghosts of the DeFeo family who had been murdered there.<br /> The DeFeo murders were infamous in Amityville after the family was discovered visciously murdered in November of 1974. And the man that was found guilty for committing this heinous crime was actually one of their own. Ronald \\"Butch\\" DeFeo Jr. was the son and brother of the deceased family.<br />This story is the basis for author Ric Osuna's book, The Night The DeFeos Died : Reinvestigating the Amityville Murders.<br /> While Mr. Osuna acknowledges that he believes that Butch DeFeo murdered his family the controversy lies in whether he was the sole killer. Butch had always contended that he had help; however, the police investigating the crime always contended that they did not believe this. The Night The DeFeos Died: Reinvestigating the Amityville Murders is an investigation of alleged lies and police corruption, that the author believes completely changed the makeup of the case. This story was well presented and the author makes a good case. As to whether the allegations that are leveled in this book are true the readers will have to judge for themselves.-- Reviewed by Simone Hawks	2002-06-21

Tempest's best friend Janessa wants the same thing any woman wants. To be loved, to be appreciated.  However, when you run with dogs, you're bound to get fleas, and Janessa finds out the difference between a boy and a man.<br />The Heat Seekers is an entertaining, thought provoking read with many plot twists and turns.  The characters are likeable if not deserving of compassion and empathy.  The Heat Seekers is complete with cameo appearances by characters from Shame On it All, including Raul, the exiguous entrepreneur, and passing mentions of the Whitfield sisters themselves.  In this piece, Zane pays more attention to the serious issues confronting her characters, and less to their shenanigans.  The book will have you doubled over in laughter one moment and pondering the decisions you may have made in your own life the next.

It is slightly didactic and a little romantic. A jolting coming of age story. However, Count It All Joy needs some developmental editing.

In addition, now that he is using a cane and getting stares from folks on the bus and rejections from potential employers, he realizes that black folks get those kind of stares and rejections on a daily basis.<br /> Tracie has been working on his novel for years now. He has endured countless rejections from publishing houses, abhoring the impersonal form letters that smash his dreams.  Can Ross use his literary skills to help Tracie get published? Will he help a man from the race he was raised to hate?<br /> Jermaine Watkins has crafted a fine novel that centers not only on racism, but also on humanism.  The prose and storyline are flowing, and the reader feels compassion, anger, and a plethora of other emotions while following this wonderful story. The characters had depth, and neither the concept nor the storyline were overdone. This is a fresh, new plot line, and I anxiously await the next effort from this talented author.<br /><br />Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-06-21
What's real?	How many chances do we get at life? What happens when we are meant to die and, yet we live?  In Tananarive Due's novel The Between, the answer may not be what you think.<br />  Hilton battled nightmares of his grandmother's death for years.  After therapy, he was able to rest without the haunting images invading his slumber.  Now, five years after he had his last night horror, the images return when his family is threatened by a racist who has set out to destroy them.  Hilton's reality becomes a jumbled mess each time he wakes up. He finds he has done things he doesn't remember doing and has not done things he recalls.  This thwart of his reality threatens to send him over the edge.<br /> I have heard so many things about Tananarive Due's novels, though I had only read her book The Black Rose. I had no idea how enthralling her fiction could be.  The writing is that of the most divine quality. The story makes you look over your shoulder.  The idea makes you stay up late trying to surmise the existence of Hilton.  The characters jump off the page and haunt your dreams. I found myself, long after the last page had been turned, wondering what it was like to live in the Between.<br /><br />Reviewed by Candace K	2002-06-16
Beauty is skin deep	The poetic prose that Oyefesobi brought to life in Sin in Soul's Kitchen makes a few cameos in his newest novel, Vanity & Voodoo Dolls. In Sin in Soul's Kitchen, Oyefesobi told us about the neo-soul movement in New York. In Vanity & Voodoo Dolls, all eyes are on a group of sisterfriends living in Atlanta who are searching for their destinies.<br /> The cast of characters includes Valadia, an aspiring fashion designer who journalizes each day's events before she turns in, making parallels from her life to that of Diana Ross' character in Mahogany. Dorian is the \\"little girl lost\\" whom Taylor, the \\"lipstick lesbian\\" of the group dotes on. Dorian is offered a modeling career by Bethesda Billings, the entrepreneurial diva and<br />founder of Type B Modeling Agency. It is then that we learn the ups and downs of the fashion industry from starlets Alexis and Fabian. Add to this already robust storyline a mysterious murder, and you have an exciting novel full of depth.<br /> With an engaging and complex plot line, Andrew Oyefesobi enhances an already interesting subject matter with his passionate writing. He uses alliteration effectively, making the chapter names seem almost like poems themselves. Don't sleep on this writer. -- Reviewed by CandaceK	2002-06-16
A Promise Is A Promise	When you begin Promises To Keep, you believe that this novel is about a family trying to track down the murderer of their son.  This book has so much more to offer.<br />Nola and Ron Kirkwood's son Troy leaves home one day, on his way to the movie theatre with his daughter, and never returns.  Four days later they are informed that their son was found murdered. Overcome with emotions, the Kirkwoods, along with their older son Vann, begin to investigate the murder much to the chagrin of a local police detective.  Troy had custody of his daughter Meika, but that ended with his death.  Now the mother of Troy's daughter fights for sole custody.<br />Promises To Keep explores a range of strengths and weaknesses of each family member as they grapple with the pain of losing a loved one.  This family has a wealth of pain that must be explored in order for healing to take place. Nola's love for her sons is examined; Ron's ego is tested; Vann's insecurities are revealed; Michelle, Vann's live-in girlfriend, has feelings of jealousy that are put to the test and as in many families, cousin Beatrice appears to be the glue that holds the family together with her faith.<br />Told with sensitivity, wit and some humor, Promises To Keep is a very descriptive and heart wrenching novel.  You can feel and imagine the characters' emotions as they interact with each other; you can visualize their facial expressions and you can feel the streets of Brooklyn Heights as they navigate to track a killer.  This is one book that grabs you and will not let go until you are finished.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-06-16
If these walls could talk...	The  building on 5th and Hill was more than a place that housed<br />state welfare assistance offices.  It was an unstable arena where<br />many of the scams and schemes under the guise of  assisting  the<br />needed were perpetrated. The writer shows how intricate plans were<br />executed by the agents offering and the clients receiving public<br />assistance.<br />In The Gray Building On 5th and Hill Ms. Blair-Reed shared an inside<br />view of how unstable the workers were and how lax the regulations of<br />one particular assistance program were. So much so, a welfare<br />recipient became a millionaire and  a social assistance agent prepared<br />for an early retirement.  As a reader I was left with my mouth hanging<br />open.<br />This was a very informative read that gave an unveiled look at the<br />politics of the social welfare system.  However it never took on the<br />tone of a novel to me, because of the format of he book.  Each<br />chapter seemed to introduce a new player and I did not have a real<br />sense of who the primary character(s) were.  I commend the author for<br />showing enough boldness to voice such a strong and sometimes negative<br />message about this very serious subject.<br />I suggest you pick up a copy, it should give more insight into why<br />the welfare system is such a profitable venture.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-06-16

Life for Blacks after Jim Crow Laws	Lee Morgan is visiting his cousin in Evansdale, North Carolina. After supper, he decides to take a walk. While walking down a dirt road, he hears the sound of a man's voice. Curious, he walks in the direction of the voice. Standing in a circle behind the brushes are several Klansmen. In the center on the ground is a black man pleading for his life and Lee watches in disbelief as the Klansmen castrate and shoot the man. He cannot think rationally and lets his anger control the situation. With clenched fist he hollers, \\"Saw what you did.\\" The Klansmen look up and start to shoot at Lee. Lee starts to run for his life.<br />In this daring tale of racial tension and injustices during the Jim Crow era, Lee is often on the run. Lee is a tall, dark and rugged man, who is experiencing difficult times in his life. Some of the white people fear him and others admire him, but getting angry is his worst enemy.<br />Lee falls in love with Lena a beautiful Indian who captures his heart. Although he meets other women it's Lena that he marries. Together they create a good life until one event threatens to put Lee on the run again.<br />Run Lee Run could have been a better novel if there was more emphasis on how the story flowed. The script moved so fast and left you with feeling that you had missed something. Roberts has the gift of creating an excellent storyline. His writing is like listening to a story told by your grandmother or mother.<br />I found this novel to be one of great interest. The storyline is one that you won't forget. I recommend that you read this novel. Roberts has written a sequel to Run Lee Run and it's called The Early Bird Gets the Worm, which will be out soon. -- Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2002-06-16

Drogan, Cassie and Sharon are the adult children of Marge Hairston, the owner and proprietor of the Woodmore Times.  When Marge can no longer manage the day-to-day operations of the newspaper, she turns to her children.  Drogan and Cassie are self-centered and shallow and turn the opportunity down, however Sharon accepts.  Of the three, Sharon has the most to lose in terms of her career.  Sharon is caring, timid but strong in her own subtle way.  Because of this decision, Drogan and Cassie are livid and blame everyone and everything, with the exception of themselves, on what they perceive as the loss of their birthright in terms of a retirement nest egg.  We literally watch as Drogan and Cassie shut out their mother and sister while taking chances with their marriages.  But Marge is as shrewd as she is nurturing and continues to make decisions that demonstrate the error of her children's ways.<br />The last fifteen pages are my favorite.  Drogan's conscience speaks to him, putting his behavior into perspective.  \\"You brought this on yourself, his conscience nagged.  You had your chance, but you were used to having your cake and eating it, too, and you thought you could duck the responsibility of the paper and still share in its proceeds.  You've done that your whole life.  This time, it backfired.

It is a tale of two African-American males from sparring generations, and an emotionally scarred single-white female, all co-existing and flung together under stringent circumstances. Martha Southgate deftly, believably, and successfully captured characters from a myriad of ages, backgrounds, genders, and races. These desperate characters cling to one another hovering just above suffocation. Invisible, untouchable situations bond them with blatant similarities that repulsed them.<br />The Fall of Rome explores the emotional struggle of a young African-American male, from a slightly underprivileged and emotionally scarred family. Martha leads us into the nucleus of his soul where we tightly live his struggle, experiencing his turbulence with him. Trying to adjust to his new environment at a historically all white boys' school, feelings of inadequacy plague him. Unfamiliar peers and difficult academia [pull] away his determination. Most of his pain stems from the gaping hole left in his heart as the young boy deals with a tragic loss.<br />The accompanying plot includes Jana Hansen, an English teacher and Jerome Washington, a Latin instructor at Chelsea, the all boys' school. Jerome is an educated recluse who rejects any responsibility as a black male role model. Although Jerome resides in a prime atmosphere for reaching, encouraging, and influencing young black males, he deplores expectations and camaraderie because of his dark covering. \\"What is it about this flesh that covers me that makes it a part of every transaction I conduct.\\" Jerome acted like an obedient slave, yet yearned for his skin color to go unnoticed. Jana Hansen, a middle-aged white woman, is more comfortable and compassionate with black folks. \\"When I was teaching back in Cleveland, I was always the only white woman in the room. So Chelsea was weird right from the start...I was comforted by the sight of two black boys near the back.\\" Her scars are from an anguished and broken heart, pulled and stretched out of shape. You'll be intrigued with the role she unwillingly plays between the two black males.<br />In her writing, Southgate exhibits a keen awareness of psyche and nature. Using her spry adjectives as the enchantress, she seduces us into feeling what she wants us to. I can still feel the affect of her adroit, quick, but poignant nouns mingling with exhilarating adjectives. This decadent combination heightens your senses. The colors are brighter, the sounds more profound, and the texture increasingly scabrous. She writes with the thick thoughtfulness of an ancient storyteller.

At night, Talba becomes self-proclaimed royalty, an arrogant, aspiring poet calling herself Baroness Pontalba.<br />Eddie Valentino is an expiring private detective. He is cranky, chauvinistic, computer-phobic, mentally fatigued, and physically exhausted. His Italian temper and his primal views of women get him into trouble. Talba becomes an aristocratic thorn in his side. \\"She was pushy, she was smart-mouthed, she was probably brilliant (or thought she was, which was just as bad) She was also cute as a button, and the whole package added up to one large pain....\\" says Eddie.<br />Julie Smith tells a toxic suspense story that keeps you guessing, curious, and anxious.

Who do you think you are?	Sometimes we discover who we are out of curiosity and other times life slaps us in the face and forces us to confront the reality of who we are.  After the death of her father, Afi-Odelia E. Scruggs seemed to have found herself asking questions that she could not answer.  These questions led her on a journey that would span over twenty years, and I suspect still continues today.<br />The book begins with a description of one of the authors few recollections of her father.  This opening scene is a pleasant memory, yet it leaves you with a bittersweet feeling because even as the author is sharing this memory, you feel her sense of loss.  Although it is clear that part of her loss is centered on the fact that her father has died, there is an even greater sense of regret at the loss of an opportunity to build a stronger relationship with him.  She comes to the realization that even though she grew up with her father in her home, his quiet nature and her lack if interest kept her from really knowing him.  Her now deceased father is a man that carried the story of his life to his grave.<br />The author then begins a journey.  Her initial goal was to learn about the events that shaped her father into the man he became with the hopes that it would help her better understand him.  What she found were just as many questions as answers, and what began as a desire to learn about her father's past turned into a full blown genealogical study of her paternal ancestry.  As with many African Americans researching their genealogy, she found herself coming against roadblocks, such as poorly kept records from a time where African Americans were considered property instead of people.  Additionally, she would encounter deeply protected family secrets, and the fact that much of the information she was seeking could only be retrieved from the few living relatives that were aware of it.  But slowly, she was able to connect stories with what had previously been only a name of someone she had never met.<br />Claiming Kin is an emotional story that describes a project that was just as spiritual as it was analytical.  As the author uncovers more and more of her family history, she also develops a better understanding of her own identity.  Further, she is better able to understand how slavery shaped her ancestors.  More importantly, she gained a deeper appreciation for the fact that her ancestors were more than just names that fit in boxes to make up her family tree.  Claiming Kin is a touching and enjoyable read that will inspire anyone to dig deeper into their own family roots and to try and preserve not only the names, but also the stories from their past.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seayd never met.<br />Claiming Kin is an emotional story that describes a project that was just as spiritual as it was analytical.

A Journey In and of Itself	I am sure that we all have heard of the foster care system in the United States and in the state where we reside. There are many stories, some good and some bad.  What has not garnered much attention is caring for a child that is a relative, which is called relative foster parenting.  Yes, you must deal with the child welfare agency that placed the child with you, but with relative foster parenting you must deal with the child welfare agency and other relatives that, for what ever reason, were not willing to care for the child.  They too have a lot of opinions.<br />The recently married Rene' and Mark Parson take on the challenge of raising Rene's nephews. Their mother Monica is addicted to drugs and living basically hand to mouth.  Rene is asked by her siblings to take the boys from Denver, her hometown, to Kansas where she is currently residing, to provide a better environment for them.<br />What evolves throughout this account of relative foster parenting are the inconsistent attitudes of the child welfare agency, the resentment of relatives and the continuation of negative behavior among Rene's nephews.  Rene' and her husband Mark learn a few lessons about the state of the family, the child, the public school system and what role environment plays in raising children.  The grass is not always greener.<br />Rene' has presented her story of relative foster parenting in a clear and realistic manner.  I was able to empathize and grasp her reality with the presentation of the prose and the dialogue.  What makes this account so emotional is the Parsons' faith in the Almighty.  Their faith is examined throughout this account and is played out many times over. Rene' ends this story with a very strong example of her nephew's thoughts that we only get a glimpse of throughout the novel.

They have come to take the O'Dere's and those around them to a new world, a world where freedoom is a thing of the past, and slavery will be their ball and chain.<br /> For people who were once free, being enslaved is like having your heart ripped out. As a person, a slave is not really allowed to do anything of their own free will. Women can be conquered by anyone and families can be ripped apart. Aidan feels that he is just existing from day to day in his life as a slave. He works hard from sun up to sun down and feels as though life has dealt him an awful hand. He and his mother were purchased by The Wakil, the leader of the world that they live in. The Wakil's given name is Abu Alli Jallaleddin ibn Rashid al Kushi. The estate that is owned by The Wakil is Dar Kush. Dar Kush is the center of a lot of activity and hosts many visiters.<br /> The Wakil has three children and among them is the youngest son Kai, an awkward, shy boy who feels that he will never live up to his father's expectations. One day Kai and Aidan meet and a long and very unlikely friendship begins. Even though Aidan is viewed by Kai as a servant, along the way their relationship develops into much more.<br /> In Steven Barnes Lions Blood, he presents a very different perspective of slavery. Instead of Blacks being slaves as was the case in history, Barnes turns the tables and puts Blacks in charge and makes Whites the slaves. Despite this twist, the author still gets the point across that slavery of any kind is wrong. This is an excellant book and in my opinion is a book that everyone should read.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Essays for the Cause	Harold Cruse was one of the most intellectual and insightful men of his time. The Essential Harold Cruse:A Reader is a collection of essays that provides into how he was thinking and what he thought as a black man during times, past and present, of racial strife and struggle.<br /> Mr.Cruse critiques some of the most well known people of his time. Chapter four of the book sticks out in mind, for example. James Baldwin, one of the most well known and respected author's ever, wrote a play called Blues for Mr. Charlie. Mr. Baldwin was emphatic when discussing Mr. Charlie that it was not a Negro play, but just a a play that had some resonant social themes. Cruse criticizes Baldwin for not being true to himself or to the cause. Mr. Cruse was very outspoken and always wrote or said what he thought.<br /> The Essential Harold Cruse:A Reader edited by William Jelani Webb was a very difficult book to read at times because some of the essays were very indepth and I felt as though the author was talking over my head and overanalyzing. On the other hand the collection of essays was insightful and informative and I feel that in reading this book that I learned a lot.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-06-05

Making a Mark on Literature	On the dinner table, Callaloo is a stew rich in spices that is made from the leaves of the African dasheen plant. On the bookshelf, Callaloo is a literary journal that has highlighted work from the African Diaspora for the past 25 years.  Edited by Charles Henry Rowell, it has provided the literary community with the profound authorship of its contributers.  Making Callaloo, a compilation, celebrates these 25 years by showcasing some of the best pieces of prose and poetry that have appeared in the journal during this time.<br />Included in the compilation are works by talented authors such as Ralph Ellison, Helen Elaine Lee, Percival Everett, Leon Forrest, and Terry McMillan.  One of the works of short fiction that I thought was particulary compelling is Octavia Butler's &quot;The Morning and the Evening and the Night.&quot;  In this short story Butler tells the tale of a diseased group of people, known as &quot;the DGD's&quot;.  The existence of the DGD's is heartwrenching, and the story lingers long after the last word has been digested.<br />The poetic voices of Alice Walker, Cyrus Cassells, Rita Dove, and Sonia Sanchez are heard loud and clear in Making Callaloo.  Cassells' piece &quot;Sally Hemmings to Thomas Jefferson&quot; paints a vivid picture of the taboo love the two struggled with. Cassels' verse is deep and rhythmic, digging a virtual trench, penetrating the readers' very being.<br />Just like the Caribbean stew callaloo satiates the body's hunger, Making Callaloo is a collection of work and authors that enriches the mind and spirit.  This is art. This is literature.  This is Callaloo.<br />Reviewed by Candace K	2002-05-22
Who do you think you are?	Sometimes we discover who we are out of curiosity and other times life slaps us in the face and forces us to confront the reality of who we are.  After the death of her father, Afi-Odelia E. Scruggs seemed to have found herself asking questions that she could not answer.  These questions led her on a journey that would span over twenty years, and I suspect still continues today.<br />The book begins with a description of one of the authors few recollections of her father.  This opening scene is a pleasant memory, yet it leaves you with a bittersweet feeling because even as the author is sharing this memory, you feel her sense of loss.  Although it is clear that part of her loss is centered on the fact that her father has died, there is an even greater sense of regret at the loss of an opportunity to build a stronger relationship with him.  She comes to the realization that even though she grew up with her father in her home, his quiet nature and her lack if interest kept her from really knowing him.  Her now deceased father is a man that carried the story of his life to his grave.<br />The author then begins a journey.   Her initial goal was to learn about the events that shaped her father into the man he became with the hopes that it would help her better understand him.  What she found were just as many questions as answers, and what began as a desire to learn about her father's past turned into a full blown genealogical study of her paternal ancestry.  As with many African Americans researching their genealogy, she found herself coming against roadblocks, such as poorly kept records from a time where African Americans were considered property instead of people.  Additionally, she would encounter deeply protected family secrets, and the fact that much of the information she was seeking could only be retrieved from the few living relatives that were aware of it.  But slowly, she was able to connect stories with what had previously been only a name of someone she had never met.<br />Claiming Kin is an emotional story that describes a project that was just as spiritual as it was analytical.  As the author uncovers more and more of her family history, she also develops a better understanding of her own identity.  Further, she is better able to understand how slavery shaped her ancestors.  More importantly, she gained a deeper appreciation for the fact that her ancestors were more than just names that fit in boxes to make up her family tree.  Claiming Kin is a touching and enjoyable read that will inspire anyone to dig deeper into their own family roots and to try and preserve not only the names, but also the stories from their past...	2002-05-22

Every page of this book added a new piece to the mystery puzzle, and I also enjoyed the numerous plot twists and turns. My only complaint is that I don't feel that all of the loose ends in the story were tied up, but overall I really enjoyed the book.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-05-22
The Sins of Our Ancestors	\\"One late night in southern Georgia, a crime is committed and subsequently covered up.\\"  Andrew Scales is a respected businessman with a wife, two daughters and two grandchildren.  Andrew has a special affection for his oldest grandchild, Kyle.  \\"The man possessed a love for him Kyle never knew.  An unconditional, transcending, yet dangerous love\\". Fast forward approximately fifteen years......Kyle is a recent college graduate who decides to settle in Albany, Georgia to take over his grandfather's business.  What Kyle finds are lies, deceit and lack of atonement.  Will his grandfather's decisions cost him everything he holds dear?<br />Granddaddy's Dirt is a soul-stirring novel that effectively utilizes several literary techniques that capture the reader's attention.  Brian Egeston's use of metaphors, alliteration, similes and imagery provide a thought provoking look at the events in this tale. The river, the dirt and death all play an important role in painting a picturesque view. The analogy of Alberto, the tropical storm, to Albany, the town, was masterfully done.  Also, the southern dialect does not distract but rather adds a realistic and unforgettable conversational tone among the characters.<br />My favorite section is the church sermon because the message delivered is symbolic to Kyle's life and the lives of the residents of Albany.  You will end this novel wondering if our unjust deeds really affect our future generations.  Are we really cursed because of the past?  If we do not admit our sins and ask for forgiveness, will our children carry our burdens?<br />I believe that Granddaddy's Dirt could be used as an excellent example for teaching writing and storytelling techniques and possibly be categorized as a classic.  This is a stunning and passionate novel that will force you to care about the characters, feel their pain and triumphant in their victories.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-05-22
I REFUSE TO BREAK!	Weeping Willows Dance will gently pull readers into the<br />recession of 1929 where abuse, poverty, suffering, and<br />above all, the depth of faith in the Almighty God, are<br />key elements in the life of Mozelle Parker. This gripping<br />tale about her plight will saddle readers' hearts and<br />penetrate their souls.<br />One thing Mozelle knows is that she does not want a husband,<br />children, or farm life. With 11 siblings, she already spends<br />her days performing like a mother. So, it is quite a shock<br />for her when on a warm Sunday morning she looks fleetingly<br />at her destiny when a dashingly handsome man makes something<br />in her flutter. At age 15, against her parent's wishes,<br />Mozelle is briefly courted and wedded to Randell Tate, 22<br />years her senior.  She leaves  home with the message that<br />Randell is her husband for life no matter how rough times<br />get. Mozelle wants to blame the Great Depression on the<br />jeckel/hyde person her husband becomes. But in truth,<br />she was too young to know and understand what caused his<br />change.<br />The writer introduces several secondary characters, and as<br />necessary as these characters were to the story, they<br />remained secondary; appropriately stopped at their boundaries.<br />This is a riveting, haunting story that underlines Mozelle's<br />struggles to rise above the tragic place where she is lodged.<br />No one told her that her life was going to be easy,  but the<br />life of drudgery as sharecroppers did not prepare her for the<br />backbreaking struggle of her own life to survive.  She knew<br />whatever she got out of life she would have to work hard for<br />it.  She didn't think she should have to do it alone when she<br />had an able-bodied husband; but that was the bed she'd made.<br />Like the weeping willow tree on a breezy day, she stood her<br />ground against all obstacles that came her way, proving just<br />how strong she was.  She would let nothing and no one keep her<br />from her goal.<br />This was a personal story for Ms. Mallette and as she writes,<br />her words literally dance across the pages.

American History 101	Prosperous and comfortable life was destroyed one fateful summer day in 1921.  The Tulsa burrough of Greenwood was once a place where African-Americans thrived.  It was known as the \\"promised land\\" to blacks living in the Jim Crow South, and thousands of African-Americans migrated there, searching for a better life.  There they erected beauty parlors, movie theaters, restaurants, dry cleaners, and numerous other businesses. These businesses were patronized by other Greenwood residents who worked for white Tulsans, but who were not allowed to buy goods and services at white-owned establishments.<br /> This was all brought to a screeching halt when a young black man by the name of Dick Rowland had a misleading encounter with a white woman in an elevator.  The charges were ridiculous and white officials knew it.  However, the officials promised Rowland his day in court.  But, a leading local newspaper used yellow journalism to sell papers that day.  The headline read \\"TO LYNCH NEGRO TONIGHT.\\"<br /> Greenwood blacks had heard the horrific tales of lynchings and destruction across the country. The Greenwood residents proclaimed \\"Not here.\\"  So, when an angry white mob gathered at the courthouse where Rowland was being held, the Greenwood people became nervous. After assembling, they decided to drive across the tracks to the white section of Tulsa armed with their rifles to make sure the mob wasn't going to carry out the headline.<br /> Feeling as if they were being threatened by the blacks, the whites armed themselves immediately after the car left.  This was the turning point, for it was no longer about Dick Rowland. It was about the perception that the blacks thought they could come into town and threaten the whites.  It was about the fact that many blacks in Greenwood lived better than their white counterparts. It was about greed, it was about jealousy, and it was about hate.<br /> Fueled by this hate, over the next two days, white Tulsans murdered over 300 black Greenwood residents.  They burned homes, businesses, schools, and churches.  They shot any black person they saw in the white side of town, and stacked their bodies on flatbed trucks, to be hauled to unmarked graves in the countryside.  The Greenwood townspeople did not give up without a fight, however.  They defended their homes and community with fervor.  But they were outnumbered and outgunned and soon, Greenwood was nothing but ash, a shadow of its former existence.<br />  Tim Madigan writes a comprehensive account of the maelstrom that occured those days in Oklahoma.  He uses personal interviews, historical documents, oral histories, and narration to bring The Burning together.  The book reads like fiction, the interviewees and survivors have strong voices, and even those who witnessed the destruction, but have since passed, have their say against the tragedy that was The Burning.  Everyone should know about what happened in Tulsa. It is as much part of our history as the Revolutionary War or the Watts Riots.

Of how hate will destroy the ability to<br />grasp the brass ring. About loving yourself before you can<br />accept and appreciate love from someone else. About following<br />your heart and finally the writer hammers home the importance<br />of forgiving.<br />I loved the writer's command of language. Her witticisms and<br />expressions sprinkled throughout the book were hilarious.<br />Initially I questioned the extreme use of metaphors.

Jamal and Lisa come from two-parent families that seem to be more stable and supportive, while Stephanie's family life is nothing short of chaotic.<br />As the story progresses, we see the four friends leave high school and move on with their lives.  Each character struggles to find a place in life and encounters many bumps along the way.  They are faced with any number of temptations, and they don't always make the right decisions.  The characters are well balanced, all of them having certain strengths and weaknesses and this made the story seem more realistic.<br />Alloway has written a novel that many young adults will identify with.  The characters struggle with issues that many young African Americans face such as sex, drugs, domestic violence, and teen pregnancy.  In addition, she demonstrates the stress that many young adults face as they adjust to the new freedoms of college life, academic pressures, and the strains of growing up and sometimes apart from old friends.  Alloway also demonstrates through the character's lives, how the choices we make impact our lives.  This was an enjoyable yet true to life read.

Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover	A serial killer is on the loose in Miami, and homicide detective M Gantry is hot on the trail. M is one of the top detectives in the department, and has a reputation for being dedicated to her job. From her unusual name to her short blond haircut, she is an interesting woman. Add to that her voluptuous body, and the minute people look at her they think this woman is a hoochie mama, little do they know she is not what she appears to be.<br /> In addition to her work on the serial murder case, M is involved in a very serious romantic relationship with a top city official. While she is strong and takes nothing from her fellow police officers, she seems to be under the control of her lover. While M feels that he is wonderful for her, but he seems to bring memories of her dark and horrible past.<br /><br /> Preston Allen's novel, Hoochie Mama, allows you to experience a serial murder investigation through the eyes of the detective working the case. As a reader you also experience the turmoil that M feels in her daily life, and you see how she tries to balance her emotions and do her job at the same time. This book was very interesting, but at times it went off in so many different directions that I was not quite sure what was going on. However, I did enjoy the suspense and surprises, and look forward to reading more of the author's work.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-05-22
Waters Run Deep	Muddy Waters is arguably the most influential guitarist of all time.  He influenced many guitarists, ranging from Keith Richards to BB King to Eric Clapton.  He started out with a makeshift guitar made from a box and listening to country blues greats such as Son House and the legendary Robert Johnson.  A sharecropper in the Mississippi Delta, Muddy's life operated on the schedule of King Cotton until a fateful day in 1941 that changed everything.  Muddy Waters (then Muddy Water) was discovered.<br />  After establishing a name for himself in the South by way of house parties and juke joints, Muddy headed north to Chicago.  Once there, Muddy worked many short-lived jobs by day and hit the clubs at night.  He eventually hooked up with Leonard Chess, owner of the prominent blues label Chess Records.  At the Chess studios Muddy brought his electric blues to the world with records like Hoochie Coochie Man, Rollin' and Tumblin' and I Just Wanna Make Love to You. His music was reminiscent of the country blues with his bottleneck slide while he wove an urbanely electrified flair.  The Delta was always in Muddy, and he never forgot where he came from.<br />  Robert Gordon, acclaimed blues musicologist, brings all the pieces of research about Muddy together in a fascinating chronology.  The book leans more toward textbook style than to narrative due to the multitude of sources Gordon used, but his asides add an insight that few textbooks are able to render.  His most prominent sources come from the oral histories of Muddy's friends, family, and associates.  I recommend this book to all lovers of things Muddy and all music lovers. Every guitarist or blues connoisseur should have this book in his or her collection.<br />Reviewed by Candace K	2002-05-22
Family Drama	Virginia and Roman Robinson are a sister and brother that know in spite of whatever adversity may surround them, they always have each other.  The story begins when Virginia and Roman are children growing up in California and ends when they are parents with adult children of their own.  The supporting cast of characters includes their immediate family and a number of other important characters with whom they have formed relationships.  The secondary characters were an excellent addition to the story, adding just what was needed for the plot and nothing more. Simone, for example, will quickly become the mother you love to hate.  As the story progresses, we see Roman and Virginia gain and lose relationships, make heart wrenching decisions, and deal with whatever situation life (or their own mistakes) hand them.  In spite of their weaknesses and obvious mistakes, Roman and Virginia serve as positive examples for African Americans because of their consistent willingness to take personal responsibility for their own mistakes and for the ills of society.<br />All families have some sort of drama, and this story tells the tale of the Robinson family's drama.  Roman is a pre-teen that is physically large for his age coming to the aid of his older sister in an effort to protect her.  Later, we see Virginia and Roman both struggle as teenagers and young adults trying to find their niche.  The author wrote lyrical romance scenes as the characters fell in love, and dramatic, intense action scenes as the characters faced wars abroad as well as in their own communities.  As a reader, I was able to experience the joys and frustrations of parenthood and experience the pain and grief associated with losing someone you love.  None of the characters were perfect, but just like in your own family, you felt for the characters in spite of their weaknesses.<br />A Family Tree, Taking Root is a beautiful story about the joys and pains associated with being a part of a family.  As the characters grow up, they dream, make mistakes and are forced to adjust to a continually changing social climate.  The plot addresses a myriad of historical events such as, the Vietnam War and the Watts Riots with depth and clarity.  The plot also addressed a variety of social issues, such as civil rights, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, gang violence, and education, with grace and plenty of emotion. However, the story is much deeper than history and social issues.<br /><br />Doc Robertson's writing draws you into the story, and his compelling characterizations make you feel as if the characters are members of your own family.  As a reader, I experienced the happiness, frustration, growth and loss right along with Virginia, Roman and their family members.  I am not sure which I enjoyed more, the rich plot of the story, or the character development.  I love a story where I can see growth in the characters and this book is filled with lessons of growth and living up to one's potential.  Although initially I felt a bit overwhelmed by the length of the book, by the end I felt as if I were losing members of my own family and longed for just one more page.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seaythe characters grow up, they dream, make mistakes and are forced to adjust to a continually changing social climate.

Feelings	Joi Weston's world is spinning out of control. Her marriage to businessman Phillip Evans is stale and her acting career is in the toilet. She finds herself at a crossroad, not exactly sure of the road that she should take. Joi and Phillip have experienced a very painful tragedy and instead of it drawing them together it tears them apart.<br /> Michael Brockmier is a sexy writer with a secret. By chance, he meets Joi and in that instant he thinks that he has found his soulmate. The fact that Joi is married is inconsequential to him and he is determined to have her at any cost. Michael's major issue is simple ; it's all about him and what he wants. Michael does not care who his actions harm as long as he is happy.<br /> In Timmothy McCann's latest novel Emotions, he makes you feel every possible emotion. Love, hate, lust, pain and many more emotions are brought to the surface in this book. The characters and their development throughout the story is awesome and watching their metamorphosis is like watching a caterpillar transform to a butterfly. I highly anticipate Timmothy McCann's next literary contribution and highly recommend that readers take a chance on Emotions.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-05-22
What Is It I Want, What Is It I Need?	Carmen, The Queen of Harlem or so she believed, is looking for a border and Mason, a.k.a. Malik is it.  Why does Malik remind Carmen of herself?  Who is Malik, who is Carmen?  These are the questions that are explored in The Queen of Harlem. While the synopsis alludes to Mason living on the other side, we get a glimpse of Carmen and who she is, which is just as intriguing. The conclusion is unexpected and exciting as well.<br />Mason is the son of a rich Southern family and before he heads to law school on the West Coast he chooses to live in New York City among the brothers and Harlem's resurrection. Jackson effectively terms this behavior, &quot;blacks blending&quot;.  Mason/Malik was a lost soul that lived, as others wanted him to live his entire life.  Enter Mason's parents, especially his mother, and you understood Mason.  Mother discovered some issues within herself that effected Mason and his decision.  We learn of Mason's childhood and his understanding that he no longer wanted to be the &quot;only one&quot;, &quot;the black guy&quot;.<br />Told in first person and highlighted in journal form, Brian Keith Jackson's novel gives the reader plenty of food for thought through his masterful use of the English language. When Malik explains to Carmen his reasoning for moving to New York her thought is  &quot;bravery implies a choice&quot;.  The following statement put the entire situation of Malik into perspective: &quot;This city is a peculiarity, a place where chameleons do as they do; a veritable island of strangers hoping to become less so as they scurry to get where they have imagined they should be; a place where even a spiderweb can appear beautiful with the right light reflecting upon it, but what light is reflecting on me?&quot;<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

History Uncovered	In August of 1930, a lynching took place.  It would not be uncommon for one to assume that the lynching took place in the deep south, but in this instance, the assumption would be incorrect.  The lynchings of Tom Shipp and Abe Smith took place in Marion, Indiana, America's Heartland.  This event is responsible for one of the most famous photographs of an American lynching.<br />The author demonstrates how stereotypes and fear contributed to the lynching.  The mere suggestion that a White woman was raped and a White man was murdered by three Black men, provided enough inspiration to turn a normally cordial, if not friendly, small town into a lynch mob. Madison outlines how a community dealt with the chilling reality that such mob violence had taken place in their small town.  Because of shame, guilt and even fear, this tragic event was buried in Marion, Indiana's collective memory.<br />Flossie Bailey, a prominent African American woman in the community, as well as others, worked hard to mobilize the community in an attempt to make sure that at least some of the people involved in the murders would be held responsible for the crimes while fear kept other African Americans in the community quiet.  Unfortunately, no one was held responsible for the crime.<br />Madison also highlights the history behind what is considered by many to be the most famous lynching photograph in American history.  The photograph, taken by Lawrence Beitler the night of the lynching, has been reproduced and widely circulated.  During the time immediately following the lynching, some people bought copies to serve as a \\"trophy\\", while others felt it was an abomination.  It is a stirring photograph that depicts two dead men hanging from a tree while crowds of White's stand around some in their Sunday best, some pointing, and some chatting and laughing.<br />This book begins with a vivid and chilling description of the events leading up to the lynching, the lynching itself and the events that followed.  The description of the scene was a result of the author's extensive research which included interviews, reviewing court documents, magazines, books and other historical archives.  Although the author noted that his initial goal was to write an article about the event, he quickly learned that the story of this lynching was much bigger than what could be captured in an article.  In addition to the actual description of the events surrounding the lynching, the author creates a historical context by providing a description of life for both African Americans and Whites during the era.  He details the role that the NAACP and committed community leaders played in fighting for broader civil rights for African Americans.<br />He ends the book with a story of healing.  On the night of the lynching, three men were in jail awaiting trial, yet only two of them were lynched.  The third man, James Cameron's life was spared, and eventually Cameron began to share his story with the world.  His goal in sharing the story was to promote racial healing and unity.  This book touches on an area of American history that is often buried and rarely talked about.  Through the author's research he is able to share a story that demonstrates just how far we as a Nation have come, and I highly recommend this book.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seayollowed.

Britton, affectionately known as Brit, has taken off to the Dominican Republic; he needed a fresh start in life and is enjoying this change of scenery. Indera \\"Indy\\" is the owner of a very successful full service beauty salon in New York City.  Indy is a take charge, take no mess type of woman.  Damascus \\"Tee\\" is a male dancer who rakes in the money and has his choice of sexual partners at any given time.  Tee is as real as he is raw.  Finally, Chyna is a stay at home mother of three grown sons and one out of control teenage daughter.  Chyna's husband is the owner of several funeral parlors and as such Chyna and her children want for nothing.  As the novel progresses, you become aware of each characters' deep, dark and painful secrets which control and prevent them from committing, loving and sharing with others.  You also become aware of how those secrets effect their loved ones and others around them.<br />The character development and dialogue is great because each characters' past is explored and as a reader you come to understand their pain and their behavior.  Birch even went as far as tapping into some mental and racial aspects of one of the character's ancestors; excellent touch.  Each chapter told in first person draws you in giving the illusion that you are there with them, listening and walking through their story.  We receive a beginning, middle and a future for each character as I found myself deeply caring about them. When the story ends, each of the characters comes full circle with their past and their present and vows to make changes in their lives.<br />Birch did an excellent job of exposing the crimes committed against children and how it can and will wreak havoc at some point in their lives.  As adults it is our responsibility to protect our children and when we fail to do that the consequences are horrendous.  Also, Birch left no stone unturned, he places emphasis and blame on all entities when it comes to the teaching and protection of our children.  This is a very thought-provoking novel that provides an enormous amount of knowledge about the state of the child.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reevesare horrendous.

Survival	In Thieves' Paradise, Dickey inserts a microscopic lens into the lives of characters struggling in the belly of a recession. These in depth characters drag themselves in and out of days of drama and danger. \\"Lots of days I get mad because I woke up again and have to go through another day.\\" Dickey gives us a frontal view of the affects 9/11 had on those living and breathing just shy of broke and almost at hopeless. Desperate, they resort to various frauds to make ends meet, using street smarts to survive, but inevitably paying an extremely high price.<br />The story takes place in the streets of Los Angeles, where money is the Alpha and the Omega. Contrary to the title, Thieves Paradise is actually about survival. It's about making sacrifices, learning from mistakes, and unconditional friendship. Our main character, Dante, faces unemployment in the wake of 9/11. His efforts to find a job produce only sterile results. His friend and mentor Jackson carries the same unemployment disease as Dante. Enhancing Jackson's unemployment hardship is some tortuous baby mama drama. Amongst a myriad of catch-twenty-twos, Dante and Jackson are damned if they do and dead if they don't. For a variety of reasons, both Jackson and Dante make a deal that terribly fractures them.<br />Thieves' Paradise is an attention-grabbing story. Poignant. Erotic. Great character development. I knew these characters well, and I cared about them. The dialogue was pertinent and greatly enhanced the story. I really enjoyed the very detailed and erotic, but tastefully written, love scenes. Dante was our sole narrator, which limited me to a single perspective...that barely satisfied the intrigue and curiosity that the storyline built up. At least one more voice from `the other side' would have given me a deeper understanding of the Thieves Paradise.<br />With excitement, emotion, and eagerness, Dickey's characters unravel a tale of hardship, tribulations, and commitment. Thieves' Paradise sucks you in, where you feel as if you are running on the streets of LA, fighting to survive. I enjoyed this book, and if you like intrigue and excitement, I think you'll enjoy it too.<br />Reviewed by KaTrina Love (Miss Love)where you feel as if you are running on the streets of LA, fighting to survive.

On the outside it looks like they have it all together, but all that glitters isn't gold.<br />Like Boogie On Tuesday is a very enlightening book it shows of the bond between sisters. It also illustrates when you say \\"for better or worse\\" just how bad worse can be. It asks the question \\"can love conquer all?\\" This is a good book that makes you think about your own relationships.<br />Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinnin	2002-04-23
Majestic�s Mystic	Majestic's Secret is an exceptional romance novel that touches on issues of the heart, explores racial identity and examines the consequences of decisions made out of love.  Set in the late 1970's, an era of disco and rock and roll, this novel quickly but methodically progresses through the year 2000.<br />Majestic Brooks is the only child of a diner owner and a free-lance artist whose mother, Marjorie, is fiercely protective of her for good reason.  Majestic, whose life is somewhat idealistic, wants more.  Feeling smothered, Majestic runs away from the confines of her rural New York home at the age of fifteen and travels to Newark, New Jersey seeking fame and fortune as a model/actress.  There, Majestic searches and finds Tony Ricolani.  Tony is the photographer that spotted Majestic on a drive through her hometown; Majestic's beauty and her dark and pleading eyes mesmerized Tony. When Majestic finds Tony he is at a lost; Tony is married with three children but he quickly takes Majestic in with a promise that she can stay for a short time but she must call her mother and return to her home.  From there Majestic hangs out with Eljen Ricolani, Tony's son, and his garage band.  Feeling that Majestic is lost soul, Mary, band member Jimmy Smith's sister, offers Majestic a place to stay until she is ready to return home.  From here things spiral out of control for Majestic and for all that seem to fall under her mystical spell.<br /><br />Michelle McGriff has written novel told with grace and tenderness.  Her characters are fully developed; her unique lyrical style is smooth and absorbing and her attention to detail leaves no stone unturned. This first installment of the Majestic Series leaves you wanting more as a host of characters are introduced.  Michelle McGriff is a writer that should be taken seriously within the contemporary romance genre because she has written an engrossing novel with more to follow.

The central theme of the<br />book is secrets and how they continue to influence your life for days,<br />even years, afterward.<br />This book is filled with mystery, political scandal, lies and deceit.<br />As the story develops it becomes clear that none of the characters are<br />as simple as they seem on the surface, each one of them had their own<br />private agendas.  There are lots of backroom deals and secret<br />relationships that add twists and turns throughout the story.  As you<br />move from chapter to chapter you learn more and more about the<br />characters.  The story is fast paced and exciting and will have you<br />flipping pages trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together.<br />This book was an enjoyable read, but at times it was just too much work<br />for me to keep up with all the characters in the story.  I think I<br />would have enjoyed this story much more had the author focused on a few<br />characters and developed them more thoroughly and in a more linear<br />fashion.  I felt like the story jumped back and forth and quite often I<br />was struggling to keep up with who was who.  At the end of the story, I<br />found myself disappointed because I wanted more closure and a clearer<br />understanding on how all the individual characters tied together.<br />There was some closure, but I would have liked to have seen a little<br />more.  I did enjoy the overall story and feel that it would make a<br />wonderful movie (where I could better keep up with the characters<br />because they would have different physical appearances).  Dunson did<br />an excellent job of telling a story in a creative and exciting way.<br />The time constraints related to telling an entire story in a day<br />coupled with such a large cast of characters made this an ambitious<br />effort.  He handled the mystery aspects of the story beautifully and<br />kept me turning pages.  If the book had a stronger ending I would have<br />rated it much higher, but perhaps there is a sequel in the future.  I<br />do look forward to future works by this author.<br />...ed with such a large cast of characters made this an ambitious <BR>effort.

SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST	Feenin by Nane Quartay is a story which encompasses a modern day survival of<br />the fittest theme.  The story which is set in Albany, New York follows the life<br />of Tokus Stone.  Tokus is a young black man who was abandoned by his mother<br />when he was fourteen and left to raise and care for himself.  Tokus survived<br />life on his own by becoming a street hustler.  He sold drugs as a means<br />to an end and constantly dreamed of a life without illegal activity.<br />After Tokus graduated from high school, he went to college during the day while<br />maintaining his street hustle at night.  He managed to avoid the long arm of<br />the law the whole time.  However during the last night in his illegal trade, he<br />has an encounter that results in the death of an addict and a corrupt cop<br />picking up his trial.  Tokus' encounter with \\"Five-O\\" changes his life at a<br />time when he thought he was doing the changing.<br />Feenin is a complicated tale that introduces several characters who are victims<br />of life's various injustices.  The people are plagued with everything from drug<br />addiction to incest to greed.  Many of these characters are introduced,<br />seemingly, abruptly, but if you hang in there with the story, things become<br />clearer.  Where Tokus is the hero in this story, Way Jalon, a power hungry<br />millionaire racist is the villain.  Before all is said and done, Tokus and Way<br />are engaged in an old fashioned good versus evil battle.<br />Nane Quartay writes well and makes good use of metaphors and description.<br />Sometimes the description becomes a little disturbing when you realize a drug<br />induced high is being described in vivid, colorful detail or that the<br />description is being used as social commentary.  After reading the final words<br />of Feenin, I felt a sense of injustice and some of the cruel irony that runs as<br />an undercurrent throughout the novel.  I can only wonder if that was the<br />author's intention.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)	2002-04-13

'Fallen petals'	\\"If you stare at the red on a rose long enough, its as if<br />its beauty and it's virtue are somehow flawed. That's what<br />I am, I'm the red on a rose.\\" This analogy embodies Patricia<br />Jones' sophomore book, RED ON A ROSE.<br />Lila Giles Calloway has been sheltered all of her life; has never faced real issues. She<br />has a rose colored view of life and no concept of how cruel<br />people can be. Jack Calloway is completely opposite and can be<br />best compared to a cactus; with barely enough to survive, he<br />grew anyway and is now an accomplished heart surgeon.<br />This book is about knowing who you are. One 'hot' Saturday<br />afternoon while Jack and Lila are returning from his charitable<br />house calls, an ill-timed mishap invades their idyllic marriage,<br />and has Lila  wondering, 'who is this man?'  Because of racial<br />slurs, Jack's action or more appropriately his lack of action<br />creates a deafening silence between them and now Lila is<br />pointing a finger of blame. After much trepidation, Lila faces<br />some truths about herself, she accepts that she too has thorns.<br />That her lack of action was just as unforgivable and just as<br />tragic as Jack's.  Now can they forgive themselves and each<br />other?<br />This story has good consciousness raising issues that make a<br />reader sit back and think. But as good as the story is, it<br />lacked a certain fluidity and that made it a cumbersome read<br />for me; a conversational tone would have greatly improved this<br />story. Ms. Jones is a talent ready to blossom and I would love<br />to see more of her in print.	2002-04-13
Family at its Best and Worst	There is probably no greater stress that family endures than the death of a loved one.  In the book Sittin' in<br />The Front Pew, Parry Brown addresses this difficult time with great emotional sensitivity and at times with humor.  The story begins with a frantic late night call announcing the death of the Naylor family patriarch, Edward Naylor.  As his daughter Gloria hears the words, she experiences shock and disbelief.  She quickly begins to prepare for her trip home to bury her only living parent.  But before she even reserves her flight from Los Angeles to her hometown of Baltimore, the drama begins.<br />When Edward Naylor's wife died leaving behind 4 young daughters, he stepped up to the plate, raising them alone.  In addition, he was active in his church and community and an inspiration to others on his job.  With all of his daughters now adults, he was just about to begin a new phase in his life by getting remarried. His death was not only a shock to his family and fianc&eacute;, but the community as well.  Now at a time when his family is overwhelmed with grief, they have a funeral to plan.  Where will the funeral be held?  When will it take place?  What kind of flowers will be used?  Who will sing at the funeral?  Even though everyone agreed on what questions needed to be asked, finding agreement on the answers was much more difficult.  As the story progresses, the family mourns together, laughs together, uncovers secrets, bickers over decisions and ultimately begins to heal.<br /><br />One of the greatest assets of this book was that there were the strong, positive male characters.  Edward Naylor was a wonderful father, a pillar of the community, and an excellent example for other men.  Another thing I really enjoyed about this book was the fact that all of the characters were well rounded.  The author did a wonderful job at helping us see both the strengths and weaknesses of the major characters and really let us get to know them.  The humorous scenes were neatly woven into the book so that just when you feel overwhelmed by all the strong emotions, you could step back and laugh.  This book made me laugh and it made me cry.

MUSINGS OF THE SOUL	Soul Rebuttals is a collection of poetry by Pierre Sutton which ponders the<br />emotions of some of life's most perplexing issues.  Sutton digs below the<br />surface of problems and tries to uncover the underlying issues and raw human<br />emotions that exist at the roots.<br />He explores a myriad of issues that range from religion and spirituality, drug<br />abuse, unwed pregnancy, love and betrayal.  Inclusive in the collection is a<br />short story, Sight and Seeing, which is broken into three parts and tells the<br />story of three troubled  souls.  The story is told in three parts by each of<br />the characters.  Sight and Seeing is a sad tale of betrayal and loneliness.<br />Pierre Sutton has a flare for descriptions and metaphors which explode from<br />almost every entry in the collection.  It appears that Sutton is trying to<br />evoke thought and emotion from readers .  However, at times his abundance of description and metaphor leaves the reader wondering what his point is.  That<br />aside, Soul Rebuttals is a respectable collection of poetry.<br />Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)	2002-04-07
A Spiritual Journey	Patience Jan Campbell was always thought to have a chip on her shoulder, and in her life she always thought it was her against the world. She was raised in a home with two parents who loved her but did not seem to love each other. Jan, as she preferred to be called, went to church on Sundays alone, and she was sustained by the love of her aunt Ada who was always there for her.<br /> During her childhood, Jan endured a devastating experience. In addition to the pain she experienced she lost someone very important, herself. She could not seem to stop the pain she was feeling and seemed to be stumbling around making mistake after mistake. Being the religious person that she is, Jan calls on the spirit of her deceased paternal grandmother, Hannah. She believes that her grandmother can help her.<br /> Hannah is a major force in the story, though she cannot stop Jan from doing stupid things, she seems to fill the empty places Jan has inside of her heart. Hannah, gives the reader the inside track as to what is going on in Jan's head and she also tries to steer Jan away from bad situations.<br /> Rita Coburn Whack's Meant to Be is a beautifully written and touching narrative. Ms. Whack's writing style is lyrical, very literary and paints a picture for the reader.

When Christian<br />was no longer a physical presence, because of her daughter she<br />still felt connected.<br /><br />Christian meets Tanya in a grocery store and they exchange<br />numbers; the two become a couple, but only on weekends because<br />that's how Tanya wants it.  Maiya, who has led a seemingly<br />sheltered life, meets Nicholas; Christian's best friend.<br />On a date with Nicholas, Maiya meets Chirstian but the two do not<br />hit it off.  Then Nicholas does something that Maiya is unable to<br />handle and as a  result, their acquaintance is abruptly severed.<br /><br />Oddly enough Maiya and Christian now become best friends; Tanya<br />and Christian get engaged and Nicholas is odd man out. What<br />follows is an event so tragic it changes everyone's life and<br />causes Maiya to create a secret she hopes will be perpetual.<br />But is any secret ever perpetual?<br /><br />Rivers has penned a story of a passionate man who is atypical<br />of most male characters found in contemporary fiction novels.<br />However, as a reader I felt that the characters were one<br />dimensional and that they were not whole characters, which made<br />it hard to empathize with them.  The climax to the story was<br />relatively quick, so that by the end of the novel, you don't<br />feel that high excitement to the conclusion. But, Rivers writes<br />with a very sensitive voice, one that I will read again. And I<br />strongly suggest you read this book and form your own assessment<br />of the story.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2002-04-07
Get to Know God the Right Way	Kevin Wayne Johnson's Give God the Glory is a wonderful instructional book broken up into two parts: KNOW GOD and DO THE WILL OF GOD.  In Part One, he teaches readers how to glorify God at all times, comprehend that they are &quot;called&quot; whether they realize it or not, and learn how to recognize and utilize their personal spiritual gifts.  In Part Two, he teaches readers to spread the gospel, stand tall, and be a blessing to others.<br />While those may seem like simple requests, most people do not act upon them daily and Give God the Glory shows us how we can make it a habitual part of our lives.  Each chapter ends with a list of questions to consider, which enables readers to analyze what they have just read and fully acclimate it into their souls.<br />For those searching for an easy-to-read guide on spiritual enhancement, Give God the Glory is a wonderful selection.  It is extremely positive to see a young African American male pen such a book because our male youth need more mentors to look to for assistance in their spiritual growth.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2002-04-02
MAN PROBLEMS GALORE	Just when you thought you had read about all the sistas having man problems in the world, along comes Karen who is torn between two men.  Karen is a recent college graduate, at least she thinks she is, when she moves to Chicago to live with Steven.  The only problem is that she still have confused feelings for Christopher, a man she dated during her college years as well.  All of her sisterfriends have their two cents to throw into her delicate dilemma and ultimately, Karen makes the choice only a &quot;youthful female&quot; would make: the wrong choice.<br />Off the Hook was a cute little novel but there is nothing special about it and it doesn't really cover anything that hasn't been covered before in numerous novels that came before it.  With the great title, I was expecting some &quot;off the hook&quot; action and dialogue but it never seemed to appear.  Teenage and college age females might enjoy the novel since the main characters do hang out in clubs and make immature, uninformed decisions throughout the novel that leave them all in dire straits.  The main character shows little growth during the time span covered.  It would have been nice to see her come to her senses at some point.  However, when it is all over and said and done, she seems to have finally made up her mind about what she wants and who she wants it from.  The only problem is, as a reader, will you really even care?	2002-04-02
Looking for Love	Shaneeka Spencer is looking for love with all the wrong people. She is a product of a bad marriage and was sexually abused at an early age. As a result, her relationship with her mother is tenuous at best.<br /> Since things at home were bad Shaneeka looked for love and acceptance with other people, particulary men. She starts dating in her early teens and by the time she turns 20, she has been engaged twice, has broken up with numerous men and she has been betrayed by her best friend.<br /> Love Don't Live Here Anymore..It Just Visits Every Now And Then, a novella by Angela S. Weathered, is an interesting journey through the dating life of Shaneeka, and is told in visits instead of chapters, which is very unique. My major problem with the story is that there were a lot of gaps. By this I mean that the author would leave off in one place and then all of a sudden things had completely changed for Shaneeka with no explanation. A good example of this is when Shaneeka begins a relationship with a man and seemingly a week later she is engaged to him. The lack happened more than once in the story and made it hard to follow at times.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-04-02
Truth Seeking	West of Rehoboth by Alexs D. Pate details the curiosity of a young<br />boy who wants to know why his uncle is an outcast within the family.<br />Edward Massey is a twelve-year-old boy who does not fit the typical<br />description of a young boy during the 60's. He enjoys reading<br />more then playing baseball with his friends. In fact, his favorite<br />books center on the fictional detective Hercule Poirot and the<br />mysteries of Agatha Christie.<br />Every summer Edward and his family travel to Rehoboth<br />Beach in Delaware. Edward's father drives them to Rehoboth and drops<br />Edward, his sister, and mother off at his Aunt Edna's house,<br />which serves as a restaurant, dance hall, and a place where people<br />come and rent rooms. Aunt Edna is famous in the area for her Bar-B-Q<br />ribs. Edward's mother works every summer as a waitress to help with<br />the family finances. The other reason for coming to Rehoboth Beach<br />was for him and his sister to get away from Philadelphia for the<br />summer to avoid the temptations of the streets.<br />The trips are annual, but his curiosity of his Uncle Rufus, which<br />everyone in the family avoids talking about,increases. This summer,<br />Edward was determined to find out everything he could about<br />his Uncle Rufus and why his uncle wasn't allowed in Aunt Edna's house.<br />He also wanted to know where Uncle Rufus always disappeared to during<br />the course of the summer, and then would suddenly reappear. When the<br />family members gather at Aunt Edna's house, he could hear<br />whispers about his uncle being crazy and when they saw him they would<br />suddenly stop talking. Edward was going to solve the mystery behind<br />his Uncle Rufus, even though he had been warned every summer to stay<br />away from his uncle.<br />Uncle Rufus is a complicated man, he has several issues from the<br />past that have caused him to retreat to another &quot;dimension&quot;<br />to relive his past mistakes and his love for one woman, Aunt Edna.<br />Rufus' story is amazing and makes it easy to understand why he is the<br />way he is. He is soon taken with Edward's curiosity of him. When they<br />both are in a truck accident, and while waiting for help, Rufus sees<br />Edward is hurt and in pain. In order to keep Edward conscious with<br />him, Rufus brings Edward to his &quot;inner dimension&quot; so Edward could<br />finally understand what turn of events made Rufus the way he is which<br />would answer all of Edward's questions.<br />The descriptions of the past and the 1962 era were wonderfully<br />detailed by the author as it reflects the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; era and what<br />black folks had to endure during that time especially in and around<br />West of Rehoboth.<br />I enjoyed the book, but was a little disappointed in the ending.<br />Although the closure was good, I was wondering if Rufus would ever<br />come to terms with reality. Perhaps, there is a sequel in the winds.<br />Overall, it was a wonderful book to read.<br />Reviewed by Kalaanina. <BR>Rufus' story is amazing and makes it easy to understand why he is the <BR>way he is.

Hunter is the founder of The Essence of Self Center, an organization that offers life-enhancing workshops to individuals and groups.<br />This novel is about sisterhood and friendships.

Susan is in complete denial about her drug addiction.    Jewell is just downright confused, she is dating a white man, but when her son's father reappears the confusion over her feelings for him increases.  Even though these women have never discussed their personal business, suddenly Crystal decides to bring them together and this is the story really heats up. <br />Hunter is clear and concise in her writing.  The plot is delivered easily in a fast paced entertaining novel.  She brings it all together in an ending that makes you want to know more about what happened to the characters.  <br />I really enjoyed reading this novel.

Ms. Hunter has written an excellent novel about friendship and support between African American women.  I plan to buy other books by the author.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2002-04-02

The author does an excellent job of giving Gabrielle, who is an observer, the voice to provide the reader with a rich and necessary history of the Hamilton family.  This is a riveting, well written, debut effort that hints at a sequel.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-04-02

LOVE HAS NO AGE BOUNDARIES	Mariah Pijeaux is knocking on the door of her fortieth birthday and has been dating a man for seven years that refuses to even introduce her to his family, rather less marry her.  She is the mother of three; two by a deceased husband and one by a father that maintains sole custody of their son but allows Mariah to see him every other weekend.<br />Mariah has several girlfriends that are also experiencing relationship \\"issues\\" and they decide to go to these hilarious, yet enlightening, relationship seminars where the doctor instructs them on debonding from the [man] they are attached to.  The seminars alone make the book worth reading.<br />While working a temporary job--Mariah still has not found her chosen career either--she finds herself attracted to a much younger man, Malik.  Decades younger to be exact.  At first, she tries to ignore the chemistry between them but ultimately decides that she doesn't have anything to lose.  What follows is an interesting characterization that flips the script on the older man-younger woman scenario.  The reaction of her kids, friends, and Mariah herself instigate provocative and stimulating thinking for the reader.  Marissa Monteilh has an interesting writing style and those that can appreciate a little humor mixed with a reality check will truly enjoy the novel.  I look forward to her next effort.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2002-04-02
Did You Catch My Drift?	Nakai's boyfriend is arrested and jailed and she is depressed; depressed with the fact that once again she has chosen a loser.  To break her out of the funk her girlfriend Sharon suggests a night of partying at local club.  There Nakai meets Robert, a fireman. Both are headstrong and humorous, and their relationship blossoms to the point that Nakai moves in with Robert. They spend the next two years going through volatile emotions and, often times, volatile physical behavior.<br />Nakai comes from a family where her disapproving mother views her as the one who makes bad decisions; her sister Taylor is the wise one who has everything going for her.

Robert is a weak man that succumbs to temptations more times than the law should allow.  Nakai and Robert place blame on each other for the failure of their relationship, and neither is willing to take responsibility for their actions.<br />Nakai and Robert each have a best friend that supports them unconditionally.  Sharon, Nakai's friend, is a spiritual woman, unconventional by mainstream standards but Nakai sees her as eccentric.  Don, Robert's coworker and buddy, is there to lend an ear and to provide some much needed advice.  These two characters add some realization to this story that features some very complex characters. But do Nakai and Robert heed the advice given by these two friends?<br />Someone To Catch My Drift is told in the alternating voices of Nakai and Robert.  I found this style entertaining, engaging, and often times, humorous.  Despite all of the drama, most chapters end with lessons learned which I found enlightening.  Does Nakai finally find herself?  Does Robert finally accept responsibility for his actions?  This is good pick that is likely to spark a lively discussion.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reevesewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-04-02

What makes a rose red?	Lila Giles Calloway has it all, a job that she loves and a husband who is a handsome and successful doctor. She feels that she has finally found her freedom from her controlling, colorstruck, and class conscious step mother.<br /> Lila often accompanies her husband on his Saturday rounds as he cares for some of Baltimore's poorest patients. This is Jack's way of remembering his past and giving back to the community. One Saturday, after making rounds, Jack stops at a convenience store and has a confrontation that makes Lila witness how ugly human beings can treat one another. This event profoundly affects the very foundation of their marriage, and it makes them question who they really are.<br /> Red On A Rose by Patricia Jones is definitely a story that needed to be told and it also poses great ethical questions. This was essentially a very good book. Patricia Jones has a great lyrical style and I enjoy her writing. However, I did have one major issue with the book, and that is Lila's overreaction to everything. Lila seemed to fly into histrionics at the drop of a hat and after a while I just felt like things were being overexaggerated, and at times this caused the story to drag.  <br />Reviewed by Simone A.

And Sara Livingston<br />is hell bent on proving that this statement is true. She has<br />no  more time for love, maybe because she always loved more<br />than she has been loved.

The supporting<br />characters play major roles in the development of this story.<br />Ms. Sloan's debut novel held me captive as I shared their lives,<br />I loved the conversational writing style she used. At one point<br />I felt I was watching a play and the characters were talking to<br />me, I hope Ms. Sloan will not lose this wonderful voice.

Iffy about the Love!	All her friends told her that one day she would meet up with the wrong man's<br />wife and all hell would break loose.  Truer words had never been spoken to<br />Marissa, an attractive, single woman who believes in getting hers -- money, gifts,<br />wining and dining, physical attention -- but the catch is she only dates married men.<br />Her no strings attach rule was made for the married man.  As she juggles four men<br />simultaneously, Marissa thinks she is living the high life until she begins receiving<br />disturbing calls from a woman that wants Marissa to stay away from her man.<br />At the same time, Marissa finds herself on the outs with her best friend Charmaine.<br />Charmaine tries to set Marissa up with Levi, a sexy, single, yet unrefined man that<br />Marissa despises at first glance.  A heated exchanged between the best friends leave<br />Marissa mad at Charmaine and Charmaine wondering if Marissa will still be her maid<br />of honor.  Now, Marissa only has her friend Brandon, a flamboyantly gay man, to confide<br />in as the calls and threats escalate to a deadly level.  When Brandon contracts Levi to<br />redesign his kitchen, he slowly infiltrates Levi into Marissa's life...to protect her,<br />and possibly more.  Marissa finds herself questioning the life she has led.  Will she<br />find the person who's been threatening her life, will she realize that she's short<br />changing not only other women, but her self when she refuses to find someone SINGLE to<br />love her and only her?<br />Gloria Mallette's Shades of Jade is a suspenseful read.  The twists and turns and<br />not-to-be-believed ending are definitely fast-paced and worth the read.  In fact, I<br />enjoyed the suspense far more than I enjoyed the romantic aspect(s) of the novel.<br />Levi's character didn't seem to be as dimensional as Marissa's, so it was hard for me<br />to care about Levi and if he got together with Marissa.  Add to that the fast pace to<br />which they got together and how it all seemed physical and not romantic.  I found it<br />hard to believe the relationship; and as a result, it lessened my enjoyment of the novel.<br />But like I mentioned before, for the drama and suspense alone, I would definitely read<br />this novel, and I would be interested in reading future works by Mallette.<br />Reviewed by Shonie Baconeemed physical and not romantic.

Looking for Love, Looking for Self	When Butterflies Kiss is one man's story of growth, dreams, fear and love.<br />Dante, the main character of the story, is a young African American male that<br />is a social worker and aspiring writer.  Dante is a complex and interesting<br />character.  As the story progress we get a glimpse of his past, the<br />complexities of his current life and his goals and aspirations for the future.<br />His greatest weakness seems to be his relationship with women.  He has buried<br />his sensitive side in order to protect his heart and is involved with any<br />number of meaningless sexual relationships.  Most important however, is Dante's<br />desire to have more for his life.  This journey for more meaning in his life,<br />career and relationships eventually leads him to some life changing decisions.<br />The other characters in the book are like a supporting cast; these characters<br />are not as thoroughly developed.  Although the reader only knows these<br />characters in terms of Dante, each character plays a critical role in the plot<br />and in the growth that he eventually achieves.  I would have liked to have read<br />a bit more about what made the female characters tick.<br />When Butterflies Kiss is a unique tale written by a team of authors.  Ten<br />writers, each responsible for his or her own chapter, write the book.  Each<br />author has their own style, but they do an excellent job of portraying the<br />characters and the plot consistently and the chapters flow beautifully.  As I<br />began this book, I was curious about what reading a novel by several different<br />authors would be like but I was quite pleased with this collaborative effort.<br />I would have liked to have seen more detailed character development for the<br />female characters and there were a couple of aspects of the plot that I felt<br />were left hanging.  Still, overall I thought this was a great effort and I look<br />forward to future works by each of the individual authors as well as future<br />collaborations...<BR>collaborations...	2002-03-09
Through the Grace of God	LaVonne Brown is the mother of two who was beaten during her marriage and terminates the beatings and the marriage by killing her husband.  This is a novel about the after affects of that decision during her ten-year incarceration.<br />Momma, Please Forgive is a self-published novel that holds great promise.  The novel is peppered with messages of learning to forgive, understanding and redemption.  Also, there is investigative work at play that is somewhat interesting.  The voice of LaVonne's mother, Gloria, is endearing and strong.<br />The story falls short for several reasons............some of the characters are not developed, there are numerous grammatical errors and the structuring of the novel is poor.  Several paragraphs and sentences begin with \\"Then Gloria took the letter\\"..........\\"Then Gloria kissed the letter\\"........... \\"Then he ran to the bedroom.\\"  At times the novels reads like a play.  For example, several chapters open with phrases such as, \\"It's early morning and the sun has risen\\"......... \\"The next morning has finally come\\"......... \\"LaVonne is now entering the courtroom of appeals\\"....... \\"It's the next morning\\". There is so much potential with the story line and the novel as a whole, however it was not captured. Loved the cover art!<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2002-03-09
Guidelines For Parenting African American Youth	The Skin We're In is the most compelling book I've read about race and raising children.  The author, Janie Victoria Ward, Ed.D. has written her fourth book about raising emotionally strong, socially smart and spiritually connected African American youth.  Ward spent years researching the moral and psychological development of African American boys and girls.  Through her research she conducted a study of actual interviews and discussions with African American Youth and their parents.  What she wanted to know was how did the tasks of parenting relate to the forces of racism.  Her study and discussions is the basis for this book.<br />Beginning with the introduction we're given insight into Ward's comprehensive four-step program-Name It, Read It, Oppose It, Replace It, which are strategies used to promote healthy resistances to negative social influences that affect our African American children.  In chapter four we're given detailed information about Ward's comprehensive four-step program.  Each step is defined and followed by written scripts taken during her interviews and discussions with the youths and their parents.<br />Ward tackles some of the tough issues that confront our African American youth today such as dating, peer pressure and racism.  What is interesting to note, is Ward's practical advice that she offers to parents on topics such as \\"Teaching our children to love themselves\\" and \\"Stressing racial pride\\".  In no way does she sound preachy.  She continuously stresses how important it is for parents to talk to their children about racial matters.  One such way is to share your own stories of resistances with your children.  This one point is like a beam of light that takes you through the entire book.<br />Ward brilliantly delivers her powerful comprehensive four-step resistance model with ease.  Her message is clear and not written in a textbook style.  Her writing is empowering from beginning to end.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is a good resource book.  What grabbed me was the resource guide in the back of the book.  The guide features lists of books, websites and videos that empower black families.  I highly recommend this book to all parents, grandparents and caregivers involved with raising African American children.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwooda good resource book.

Stark Realities of Drug Life, but Slowly Paced	Samuel Jackson, aka Black, has gotten himself caught up in a situation that<br />even the high of drugs can't take him away from.  Once a family man, Black has<br />lost himself to drugs.  His journey for the next high leads him to his \\"piping<br />friend,\\" Leroy, through which he becomes a prime suspect in the murder of a prominent<br />politician who is found dead in a North Philly crack house.  Soon, Black finds himself<br />on the run with Leroy and two fellow crack addicts.  The police are hard pressed to<br />pin this murder on somebody.  Will Black go down for the crime?  Will the real killer<br />be revealed?  Will any of them realize the dark paths their lives of addiction are<br />leading them to?<br />These are all questions that are answered in Solomon Jones' novel, Pipe Dreams.  I<br />have to say that right off the bat, I was entrenched into the Philly word of drugs<br />and the corruption of the police department.  I could see and smell and feel the<br />atmosphere of the story, and Black's character was complex enough where I enjoyed<br />going through the story with him; however, the story read slow to me, so slow that<br />I had to keep putting the book down and coming back to it.  The slowness kept me from<br />giving this book a higher rating, ut I did stick with it and enjoyed the story's finale.<br />I would suggest others to pick up Pipe Dream and get lost in its realism, and I look<br />forward to reading other works by Jones.<br />Reviewed by Shonie Bacon	2002-03-09
Who can you trust?	Jasmine Myers is not your typical private investigator; she is battling the bottle, she craves having a baby, and her ex-husband wants her back. With that being said the obvious question is how in the world does she find time to do her job? Well somehow she does. In the opening of the novel Jasmine is hired by Kristal Woods, a highly respected community leader, to investigate the mysterious death of Kristal's husband Ralph, who was a member of the San Jose, California Fire Department and President of the San Jose Black Firefighters. Jasmine feels that this will be an open and shut case for her because Ralph's death has already been labeled an accident.<br /> Jasmine's father, Lieutenant Ron Myers, is a ranking officer in the San Jose Police Department and he strongly advises his daughter not to take this case. He thinks it is a waste of time and energy. She ignores her father and dives headfirst into the investigation. Jasmine soon discovers that this case is about much more than the death of Ralph Woods. When two other firefighters turn up dead and Kristal is accused of theie murders the story takes a very dramatic turn.<br /> No One Is Innocent by Gayle Tiller is a great mystery book, there is so much suspense you can't wait to turn the page to see what will happen next. Near the end of the book the story began to drag a little, but overall it was a good read. I look forward to more books by Ms. Tiller and hope to read more about Jasmine in the near future....	2002-03-09
Intriguing, Suspenseful and Superbly Written!	Gary Hardwick is back with a vengeance in his latest mystery thriller titled The Color of Justice.  This novel was definitely well worth the wait and more than exceeded my expectations.  Fast-paced and action-oriented, the reader is taken on a harrying roller coaster ride from Chapter One as Hardwick takes us to the scene of a brutal, grizzly and bizarre murder of one of Detroits elite and wealthy African American families.  This is only the first of many murders that will occur and will require not only the Detroit Police Force but also the FBI to figure out who the killer(s) is.<br />Hardwick reunites us with one of Detroits finest Detective Danny Cavanaugh.

Once I had a moment to devote my attention to Color of Justice, I devoured this book in one sitting; it was my first read for 2002 and what a suspenseful and engaging read it was.  Hardwick gives us an action-packed, fast-paced, suspenseful and intriguing storyline.  Plot twists and turns abound and just when you think youve figured out the villains, Hardwick throws you another curveball and takes you on another terrifying and thrilling roller coaster ride.  I only had one  minor pet-peeve with the storyline and that was the theory behind the murders.  The theory was really weak for me but the creatively crafted storyline more than made up for that little nuance.

However, due to poor character development, grammatical errors, and numerous misspellings, this book was very hard to read. The grammatical errors and the misspellings made this a very cumbersome read, I feel that with better editing I may have rated this book higher. On the RAW scale it is a 2.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Definitely Gets Into the Secrets of MY Soul!	I was eager to read Faison's latest book of poetry titled Secrets of My Soul.  <BR>Her first poetry book (Poetically Speaking to the Heart, Mind, Body, and Soul) <BR>left me speechless with its flow and rhythms, and I had hoped that Faison would <BR>deliver the same powerful words to me again.  I was NOT disappointed.<br />Faison once again opens up her heart and soul to reveal her thoughts on her <BR>identity, love, love lost, spirituality, black men, and the joys and pains of <BR>the world to which we live in.<br />Some of my particular favorite poems were the title poem, Secrets of My Soul, <BR>Fast Girls, And He Kills A Dream, To One Million Black Men, A Woman in Today's <BR>World, Rev.

Knowledge Filled Account of Black Women	'Nature of a Sistuh' was not a main stream fiction about<br />a sista's attitude, but it was a story by and about the<br />lived experiences of Black women in contemporary culture.<br />The twentieth century has been as era of perpetual growth<br />and development for Black women in American society.  And<br />the book aptly states, &quot;From the popular culture of<br />advertising and film at the turn of the century where the<br />image of 'mammy' was pervasive; to the 1960s where the<br />image of 'welfare queen' was on the rise; to the present<br />where Black women's stories, both true and fiction, rise<br />to the top of bestsellers' list; Black women are continuing<br />to move from that predefined object, to self-defining<br />subjects AND toward center&quot;.<br />This book is a potent knowledge filled account of Black<br />women on the rise. It is expertly broken into two sections:<br />Section I - SISTUHS IN THE IVORY TOWER:<br />  EXPERIENCE IN THE ACADEMY<br />Section II - SISTUHS READING:<br />  QUIET STRUGGLES THROUGH LITERATURE<br />This is an excellent study guide, as it chronicles the<br />struggles, the victories and of course the 'nature', of<br />Black women. Much research was expended to develop this<br />book and the information shared shows truth in the once<br />popular expressions 'we've come a long ways baby', but it<br />also points out that, as an equally popular song says,<br />'we've only just begun'.<br />This is a must read if you want documented facts and<br />statistics showing how we have become who we are.

He struggles with his alcoholism, his family relationships, <BR>his relationship with his daughter and her mother and his own insecurities.  <br />Easy `Cause You're Beautiful is a wonderful book that gives voice to a twenty <BR>something African American male that is ready to grow up.  The book focuses on <BR>the day-to-day struggles of a man with a dead end job, a child to support, and <BR>with a desire to finally find true love.  This book was a refreshing change <BR>from the many books that offer a female perspective on things. Brandon Bennett, <BR>a musician himself, did a great job of integrating his own love for music into <BR>the story as well. He addresses a number of tough issues, including substance <BR>abuse and interracial relationships with finesse.  I loved the way the ending <BR>was both surprising but not overly neat and tidy.

An Intense Ride	Darline Dource-Coupet's first novel, Embracing the Horror, is a fresh and unique love story with just enough suspense to keep the pages turning.  The story starts out in Haiti during a battle between the natural and supernatural realms.  Young Erin Arielle Symonette is involved in a ceremony in which a spirit that possesses her is cast out.  Next we move to the present,  which is about 9 and a half years later, in Florida.  Arielle, as she prefers to be called, has grown up and is now a driven, ambitious and beautiful woman.  She works for Mecca Miami, a fashion magazine, where she has worked her way up the ranks and is now Fashion Editor.  While attempting to interview Cedric Courage, one of THE most successful rappers on the scene, for Mecca she begins developing a relationship with him.  As the relationship between Arielle and Cedric begins to blossom, we see them share intellectual conversations, develop a friendship and eventually they develop a more intimate relationship.  Arielle's life begins to shift from that of a career driven woman, to a party woman trying to juggle her new social life with Cedric and her job.  The stress of the two competing lifestyles begins to affect her in some dramatic ways.<br />As the story continues, Arielle finds herself alone on the romantic getaway cruise she had planned to spend with Cedric.  As a result of her anger and disappointment, she decides she will make the most of her trip and have a great time in spite of Cedric's absence.  It is then that she meets an attractive man, a Romeo of sorts.  This meeting changes the course of her already complicated life. Eventually, Arielle finds herself trying to figure out which man, Cedric or \\"Romeo\\" is the man of her dreams.<br />The author does a wonderful job of developing the characters during the course of the book.  With each chapter, you learn a little more about the childhood and background of the characters and you see how these past incidents shape their present lives and choices.  The story is told from the first person point of view so you get an even clearer sense of what is going on in the mind of the character.  Arielle is the primary storyteller in the book; however, I did not find her character to be very likable.  In my opinion, she did a lot of manipulative and selfish things throughout most of the book.  At the same time she was also a young woman searching for meaning, self-discovery and love in her life and as much as I disliked her, at times I really felt for her.  I found myself shifting from hoping she gets what she deserves to hoping she can finally find peace.<br />My initial thought upon receiving my copy of Embracing the Horror was \\"this is a long book\\" and I wondered whether or not it would have enough substance to sustain my interest throughout.  Don't let the length of this book deter you from reading it because it is quite an enjoyable read.  The book is suspenseful, erotic, romantic, and even supernatural at times and just when you think you have everything figured out, the author slips in yet another unexpected twist.  This story will make you angry, nervous, frustrated, and the steamier scenes may send you searching for your significant other.

A Casual Stroll Down Memory Lane	Imagine yourself sitting in a cozy living room, sipping tea and chat with your<br />grandmother.  This is exactly how you will feel as you read the book Pieces of<br />the Crazy Quilt.  The book although fictional, is largely based on the<br />experiences and memories of the author herself.  Melvin, the main character of<br />the book, like the author is given a name that is traditionally considered that<br />of a male.  The book takes place in Detroit, Michigan and covers the time<br />period of the 1920's through the early 1940's.  It highlights what life was<br />like for African Americans during this often overlooked historical era.<br />What is most refreshing about the book is Melvin's voice.  The story is told<br />solely from her point of view as she reminisces about her childhood and<br />family.  As she relates various stories about her growing up on Herbert Street living in the \\"Green House,\\" you become so drawn in that as a reader you feel<br />like you are right on the street and are one of the characters.  The  \\"Church<br />of the True Believers\\", where Melvin and her family attend, has enough drama to<br />keep the pages turning.  In addition, to the drama Arnett has created or<br />perhaps re-created a diverse cast of characters, some to be respected and<br />others to be despised.  However, through all the drama and through all the<br />characters, important life lessons are learned.  If there is any message that<br />stands out in my mind after reading this book it is that all experiences, good<br />or bad, are opportunities to learn and grow.<br />Marvin Arnett tackles any number of tough issues such as love, loss, poverty,<br />wealth, hurt, healing, wisdom, education and the importance of having God in<br />your life.  This isn't a Christian Fiction novel per se, but it is abundantly<br />clear that part of what helped sustain the Sprague family was their faith in<br />God.  It was refreshing seeing a mother and father working hard to support and<br />provide for their family.  William Sprague, Melvin's father, was a pillar of<br />strength and wisdom that would climb any mountain for his children.  Grace<br />Sprague, Melvin's mother, had a quiet and enduring faith, and her kindness was<br />felt throughout the community.<br />Arnett's conversational writing style makes you feel more like you chatting<br />than reading a book.  The characters were so alive that I felt as if I knew<br />them personally.  The book is loaded with moral lessons, but never comes across<br />as preachy.  This story will make you laugh, make you cry, and even make you<br />want to haul off and punch someone in the nose.  This was an excellent effort<br />and I truly look forward to any future works by this author.  I highly<br />recommend this book.<br /><br />...ir family.

Love BEYOND Color	Imagine being young and talented and having the opportunity to go off to college<br />and better yourself.  Also, imagine a family life that's riddled with poverty,<br />abuse, and responsibilities beyond what any teenager should have.  This is the<br />life of Peggy Dana, a while teenager who ise offered a basketball scholarship to<br />play at University of Maryland.  Her mother, who initially insists she stay home<br />and help take care of her siblings, reluctantly lets Peggy Dana go off to college.<br />Due to the dorms eing filled, it's arranged for Peggy Dana to live with a couple<br />off-campus during her first semester of college.  The couple, who is black, and<br />Peggy Dana are somewhat shocked to find they don't have race in common, but the<br />journey that the trio experiences as they live and love together will outmeasure<br />any differences they have.<br />DeVincent-Haye's novel, 22 Friar Street, was an excellent read.  I was quickly<br />brought into Peggy Dana's mind and world and felt the conflicts that dwelled inside<br />her about her family back home and her family with the Ellens.  Each character was<br />vividly drawn, with individual feelings, personalities, strengths, and weaknesses.<br />I was touched by the gentle way the race issue was dealt withi n this story, though<br />I did find the &quot;Mister&quot;/&quot;Missus&quot; references by Peggy Dana a bit too much to take at<br />times.  Overall, 22 Friar Street was an extremely fast read for me, that touched me<br />and moved me and made me care about the characters and the problems they faced.<br />Reviewed by Shonie Bacon	2002-02-18

The only problem that I had with the story was the fact that the author went back and forth between the present and the past, the transitions were at times a little confusing and I wasn't always clear as to who was narrating the story. However, overall this is a wonderful book and I really enjoyed it. I eagerly await the sequel that the author eludes to.  <br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2002-02-18

Educational	I have often wondered why African American youth choose to become members of cults and other non-Christian religions.  It has been a mystery until now. Dr. Joyce Henderson, author of the book Why African American Youth are Attracted to Non-Christian/Nontraditional Religions and Sects, gives us insight into some of the possible contributing factors. Henderson, who earned her doctorate degree in Ministry from Carolina University of Theology in 1997, has worked with children for thirty-two years at various Recreation Centers throughout the Los Angeles area.  She has also held positions of instructor and Associate Pastor and is a Certified Marriage and Family Therapist.<br />She conducted a study to determine the needs of Young African American youth.  Twenty-eight mothers and 60 children between the ages of 5 through 19 were selected from congregations of several churches in the Watts and Compton area of Los Angeles.  The interviews were conducted in the church schools, Church and home setting with or without the parents present.<br />Now with that aside let's talk about the contents of the book.  Written in ten chapters and beginning with the chapter on Methodology and ending with a Message to the Clergy and Church the book is very educational.  Henderson devotes a chapter to explaining which religions are Christian and Non-Christian.  The religions discussed here are Buddhism, Baha'I faith, Islamic, Jehovah Witness and Cults.  Each of the religion's characteristics and beliefs are discussed along with the attractions for African American Youth.  Most of the chapters contain written personal interviews with people of that particular faith or cult.  Henderson's factual information on the different religions and practice was taken from newspaper clippings and interviews with the officials.  She is objective in her writing and used the Holy Bible as a reference.  She does not blame any religion as the cause but simply states the conclusion of her study and offers some suggestions.<br />I enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to Parents, Ministers, Sunday School Teachers, Youth Directors, and Communities.  I now have a much better understanding of the many different religions and their attraction to African American youth.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwooduggestions.<br />I enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to Parents, Ministers, Sunday School Teachers, Youth Directors, and Communities.

Can A Hustler Be Hustled?	If you are looking for another relationship story where boy meets girl and falls in love then this is not the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a rich literary tale that is multifaceted and has great character development The Mitt Man is the perfect story for you.  The story takes place in the late 1920's and highlights the lives of African Americans during that time.  The book is set in both New Orleans and Harlem and so you are able to see how life was different in those places.  Taylor exposes us to a number of paradoxes throughout the story, you read of racism and racial harmony, economic depression and financial excess, true love and meaningless sexual encounters, justice and hustles.<br />The main character in the story is King Fish, who starts out as a small time hustler.  After trying to pick the wrong White man's pocket, King Fish's life is changed forever.  As his friendship grew and his mistrust faded, King Fish develops a unique relationship with the man he had been trying to rob and found himself giving up his con games and becoming the Pastor of a growing African American Church.  But is he sincere about his changed life or is this just another con?<br />King Fish falls in love, marries, and settles into the life of a Pastor.  But then a series of tragic events land him in jail with a life sentence.  While in jail, he meets Jimmie Lamar, a hustler from New York that pulled a successful con on the wrong men.  Although much younger than King Fish, Jimmie Lamar has had a difficult life, never knowing his father and trying to care for his alcoholic mother.  At 18, he has dropped out of college and moved to Harlem where he quickly learned how easy it is to make money if you know the right game.<br />The two men form a special bond that changes both of their lives forever.  The greatest struggles the men face are the search for identity, love, acceptance, God and what it means to be a man.  Each of them searches for a sense of inner peace and meaning and the book guides you through this journey.  First time novelist Mel Taylor has put together an exquisite and enjoyable literary work.  His rich language and detailed characterization will have you feeling for the characters while drawing you into the era in which the book takes place.  At times I felt the story was dragging and had unnecessary details, however, as I continued to read I would understand why the details were important.  This is an excellent effort and I look forward to Taylor's future works.

Truly Each Other�s Keepers	\\"I'm not talking about that!  It's this marriage, Clifford.  I'm not in love with you anymore.  I'm not sure I even like you.\\"  And there you have it, the opening of Bittersweet.  It opens with a bang and continues with more drama. Bittersweet is the story of three brothers Clifford, Victor and Nathan Matthews and their mother who raised them alone after the death of their father. But there is so much more.  More in the form of their relationships with each other, their wives, children and significant others.<br />The opening chapters within the novel are appropriately titled:  The Achiever is Clifford, a man who is studying for his MBA, married, working full time and raising two sons.  The Gladiator is Victor, the angry, rogue bus driver with a child in Pittsburgh while he lives in Cleveland. The Prophet is Nathan, the married minister and father two teenage children whose faith is tested.<br />As you continue to read you will go through the lives of these three men as they navigate through their daily issues of a pending divorce, temptation and child visitation.  Each man, along with their mother, share a spirit in which each can feel when drama is about to unfold with the other.  While these three brothers are as different as night and day, they are fiercely protective of and loyal to each other.  Victor and his mother shares a family secret that the other two brothers know nothing about.  Momma is one of those mothers that can give you a look and you straighten up.  Johnson's descriptions of this are vivid and at times hilarious. What is interesting is that each brother is there for the other but it is Victor, the brother with the questionable life style, that comes through for the others, albeit in a clumsy way but<br />nonetheless he comes through.  Victor has this uncanny ability to see people as they really are but the others assume that he is jealous and bitter.  Clifford and Nathan cannot believe that Victor is from the same family and neither can I.  His speech is horrible and hard to adjust to and his behavior is horrendous and almost incorrigible but considering what he went through with his marriage and the secret that he carries it is understandable.  When this story plays itself out it is Victor who comes full circle and is victorious.<br />The titles of each section, such as Troubled Waters, Darkness Descends, Reality 101, Sharing Jeremiah's Cup, Adrift in Dadaland, Their Brother's Keeper, Just Us, Manhood and the ending, Genesis are appropriate to the drama that rests within each section.  For each brother Genesis reflects their beginning anew, their coming full circle with their lives.<br />The dialogue is very good and the thought process of the characters at times is lyrical and almost symbolic. When you complete Bittersweet, you will agree that this story is bittersweet and a good read.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R.

A Supernatural Journey	Matthew Allen had a seemingly perfect childhood, that is until the death of his father.  Struggling economically, his family was forced to move out of their comfortable suburban home, sell most of their valuable belongings and move into a tiny apartment.  Many of the things children tend to take for granted slowly slipped out of Matthew Allen's reach.  Things only became worse after his mother remarried and eventually Matthew became the victim of a major tragedy.  As a result of these things, Matthew decided that the best way to cope in a cruel world was to cut himself off emotionally, not caring about anyone he encountered.<br />As the story begins, Matthew is beginning his medical internship at a hospital he is less than thrilled about working at.  His ability to get along with both colleagues and patients is severely limited due to his emotional distancing so he keeps to himself as much as possible.  That is until a 98-year-old, seemingly homeless, African American patient, who prefers to be called &quot;Grandma&quot; is placed under his care and he is forced to once again feel.<br />Together, Matthew and &quot;Grandma&quot; go on a supernatural journey that allows them to travel time and space in order to find healing.  &quot;Grandma&quot; poses a difficult question to Matthew, &quot;Do two wrongs make a right?&quot;  and he must struggle to arrive at the answer.  In doing so, he must journey as a spectator through his own childhood and some of the lives of people in &quot;Grandma's&quot; past.<br />In this book, Armstrong creates a tale in which gender, age, class, and racial barriers are transcended through the special bond that Matthew Allen and &quot;Grandma&quot; develop.  The unlikely duo work together to heal the emotional wounds of the past and build new hope for the future.  Though at times the language in the dialogue was a little bothersome, the story will draw you in making you feel anger, sorrow, frustration and joy right along with the characters.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seayrs.  <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2002-01-05

An Emotional Charge	As soon as you open this book and begin reading the poetry you will know that the title most accurately reflects its contents.  The author notes in the introduction that the placement of the poems on the page is consistent with the breaks and emphasis that would be necessary for the poetry to be performed.  This adds to the unique rhythm and pulse that is reflected in each of the poems.<br />At the outset of the book, Lawson delves into the world of a woman scorned.  This is the part of the book you'll want to read when you want to sit and brood about a relationship gone bad.  The poems focus on men that have not been responsible in relationships and the resulting feelings, primarily hurt and anger, they also force you to observe the actions of the women involved.  Lawson highlights the responsibilities that women must take for accepting the unacceptable for the sake of a relationship. She does a wonderful job of working emotions such as insecurity and fear into her poems as well.<br />In the poem &quot;I Got a Man&quot; Lawson describes how difficult it can be for a woman to let go of a relationship that is no good.  The female voice in this poem relates all the lies and cheating that she has experienced in the course of her relationship while trying to talk herself into saying goodbye for the last time.  &quot;I Got a Man&quot; really highlights how it is difficult for many women to let go of something that is bad because of their fear of being alone.<br />Another unique aspect of this collection is the way in which Lawson took traditional nursery rhymes and made them her own.  After reading this collection, Jack and Jill and Little Miss &quot;Muphet&quot;  will take on a whole new meaning for you.<br />The final selections of poetry in this collection are what I would call the &quot;Moving On&quot; section.  These poems encourage you to dream, to smile and to be thankful for your blessings.  My favorite of these poems is &quot;Lonely...Not Alone.&quot;  In this poem, Lawson focuses on how at times it is better to be alone than to be unhappy and lonely while in a &quot;relationship.&quot;<br />Overall, this was a good collection.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if I were in a different phase of my life.  However, Lawson is a wonderful poet who can weave together words beautifully.  I look forward to future works by this author, especially those covering a broader range of subject areas.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seaypoem, Lawson focuses on how at times it is better to be alone than to be unhappy and lonely while in a &quot;relationship.&quot;<br />Overall, this was a good collection.

Spirit In Poetry	Spirit in poetry is the setting for Alpha McCoo's first book of poetry, A Time of Healing.  Beginning with the introduction, McCoo defines the act of healing and what transpires.  The hallmark of this book is the reference to God as a part of the healing process and each of the poems testifies to that.  This book is written in four parts of poems, trials, triumphs and celebrations of women who have experienced pain and suffering in their lives.  One poem in the triumph section, That Was Then left me speechless.  The poem speaks about a womans relationship with her lover who was abusive.  She compares herself with an old condemned house.  In the end of the poem she tells her lover \\"Take a seat on that crystal staircase, and say to you this one thing, that was then...but just look at me now.\\"  This is just one example of the end of a poem in this book.  You can feel the spirit in the words.<br />I have never read a book besides the Bible that was so spiritual.  This book you can take to bed with you and read.  I truly believe that God inspired McCoo to write this book of poetry.  The purpose of this book of poetry is to heal.<br />The cover of this book has a picture of a beautiful black woman with her head tilted back and tears streaming down her face.  Her eyes are closed and her left hand is resting on her breast but she is looking up.  I remember reading in the introduction about tears.  \\"Your tears are not a testament of your weakness, but a validation of your strength.\\"  I plan to tell my friends about this book and buy a copy to donate to The Women's Shelter because this is a book about healing.  Women of all races could benefit from reading this beautiful book of poetry.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2001-12-28
Love Conquers All	I am a romantic by every standard, just like that person who can read<br />a romance novel on a daily basis. Although I'm not at that point yet,<br />I do enjoy a good wholesome romance book and A Dangerous Deception by<br />J.M. Jeffries satisfies that romantic interest very nicely. I really<br />enjoyed the storyline and the depth of each character.<br />Cher Dawson and Luc Broussard are madly in love with each other. Luc<br />proposes to Cher and they begin making plans to marry. Now this is<br />where Luc's mother, Victoria Compton, comes in and puts a very<br />devious damper on Cher and Luc's marriage plans. Victoria Compton has<br />other ideas about whom should marry her son and that does not include<br />Cher, who she considers from the wrong side of the tracks, not good<br />enough to marry her son.  While Luc is attending classes, Cher is<br />cleaning and preparing for his mother's arrival to announce and<br />celebrate their good news. Victoria arrives at their apartment<br />earlier then expected,and Cher is unprepared for the shock that<br />Victoria has for her. Victoria reveals to Cher that she has been<br />doing quite a bit of background checking into Cher's life. Victoria<br />blackmails Cher into accepting a proposition that will remove Cher<br />from Luc's life forever. Cher accepts Victoria blackmail to protect<br />the one person who saved her from the streets and possible death<br />from losing his job and being humiliated. While Luc is in class,<br />Cher packs up and leaves. Luc is left hurt and totally bewildered by<br />Cher's sudden departure.<br />Years later, they are bought together again, but under more<br />unfortunate circumstances. Luc's mother, Victoria, is murdered and<br />everything points to her younger husband, Edward Compton. Although<br />he is tried and acquitted, Luc, who is now a widower, continues to<br />believe Edward Compton killed his mother and will not give up until<br />he is brought to justice along with anyone else involved. To do that,<br />he must enlist the help of a person he thought he would never ever<br />see again, Cher Dawson. Cher is now a Lieutenant on the police force<br />in the town where Edward Compton now lives with his sister.  Working<br />with Luc to help solve his mother's murder does not sit well with<br />Cher. Luc's closeness brings up long submerged feelings and she is<br />nervous that he will find out a secret that she has kept from him.<br />The investigation begins and the revelations definitely keep the<br />pages turning. The ending is wonderful and very calculating.<br />You will indeed enjoy this book.<br />I applaud the writing team of J.M. Jeffries for a wonderful,<br />suspenseful and romantic novel of love that withstood much turmoil<br />but prevailed in the end. I recommend this book and give it a rating<br />of 4.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani>he must enlist the help of a person he thought he would never ever<BR>see again, Cher Dawson.

Dating and Mating:  Learn the Difference	Ms. Lawson offers short easy to read chapters about<BR>finding your mate in The Mating Game.

There really isn't<BR>anything new between the covers of this book, but it<BR>is packed with good information. <br />One of my favorite chapters in the book is &quot;Winning<BR>Ways: Don't Plug into my Power Strip.&quot; The author<BR>writes about how we can lose our identify in our<BR>partners or as Ms Lawson refers to it; &quot;zapping his<BR>power or sponging off his vibe.&quot; <br />The Mating Game is for someone who possibly forgot how<BR>to date/mate or looking to reassess their mating<BR>skills.

It's Just Doing What Love Does.	Friendship Cake is the beginning of something good &amp; with every single piece you get a wonderful memory. Just like the women of Hope Springs Community Church. Each one has a special ingredient to offer the recipe of Friendship. Beatrice feels a project such as creating a cookbook is just the thing to build fellowship to Hope Springs Community Church. The committee members are Beatrice, Louise, Margaret, Jessie and Charlotte. Bea is considered a busybody; personally I think she's a people person. She's always in touch with everyone's life. I guess that privilege is afforded to her as President of the Women's Guild.<br />Louise Fisher was heart-broken by the only person she has ever loved. She lives her life waiting to exhale. Under unfortunate circumstances she is allowed to breath, but that breath is short lived.<br />Margaret Peele is the strength of the Women's Guild. At a very early age she was taught how to cook and make ends meet in a kitchen. After her mother's death Margaret turns in her apron for a tractor-trailer and a woodshed.<br />Jesse Jenkins is the only African American woman in attendance at Hope Springs Community Church. I believe Jessie is the quiet storm in the recipe, until she finds the peace only her mother can offer, and lastly the Reverend Charlotte Stewart; she's young and the first woman preacher at Hope Springs.<br />Together these women enlist the help of family, friends and schoolteachers to share their recipes for the Hope Springs Community Church Cookbook. Lynne Hinton's characters jump right off the pages and into your heart. This book reminds me that friendship is setting aside your personal feelings and being there for the love of your friend. Louise says it best \\"Love is just doing what love does.\\" Friendship Cake is a must read and I guarantee these characters will stay with you long after you turn the last page.	2001-12-16
WHAT ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR IN A MATE?	The premise of Anita Lawson's book is simple: play or be played. From sections like &quot;Who is the Slut?&quot; to &quot;Coochie Under Contract,&quot; the book is entertaining to say the least. It might actually teach something to the younger generation (under thirty) or some slightly older adults that may or may not have deciphered the ins and outs of relationships by that point. The Mating Game breaks down everything from levels of dating to levels of intimacy to levels of cheating and lying. I kid you not. There is actually an entire chapter on &quot;The Art of Lying.&quot;<br />Ms. Lawson helps lost souls discover why they always select the wrong partner and how they can improve their chances of finding the right one. She even asks a series of questions so that readers can develop a profile of their perfect lover, if there is such a thing. So for those who feel is it more efficient to make a list and check it twice before stepping out for a night on the town with a new prospect, this book is a must read. For those who realize that life is about the luck of the draw and what you ultimately make out of it, you will still enjoy the humorous sections of the book and might even use it to establish a debate between the sexes at a social gathering. Either way, you will be entertained.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-12-16

Hot Steamy Romance Novel	Gwynne Forster's romance novel, Scarlet Woman is truly a winner.  Forster is very descriptive in her writing.  From the beginning to the end, this book is filled with some hot love scenes and should have been labeled \\"read at your own risk\\" below the title.  Layered with high drama and suspense this novel proves to be a good read.  Forster also deals with current issues in her book such as Dyslexia.<br />The story takes place in a small town called Ellicott City and revolves around three main characters, Melinda Jones, Prescott Rogers, and Blake Hunter.  Melinda is a young and beautiful African American woman who teaches English at the local high school.  Prescott Rogers is an elderly self-made inventor who has made a fortune dealing with Film-developing and contact lens and fluid however, he has a secret: he lives his life as a recluse because he is Dyslexic.  Blake Hunter, tall and handsome lawyer and executor of Rogers's estate has many personal issues to deal with.<br />Melinda and Rogers enter into a marriage of convenience and live happily together for four-and-a-half years before Rogers dies.  During the marriage Melinda and Blake develop deep feelings for each other but do not act upon them.  When Rogers dies Melinda is shocked to the core when she learns about the conditions of his will.  One requires her to set up a charitable foundation and to remarry within the year or lose her inheritance to the charity of Blake Hunter's choice.  Somehow the reader is lead to believe that Rogers had some insight into how Melinda and Blake felt about each other.  This is where the story heats up as Blake and Melinda take their feelings to a new level.  The drama and suspense will keep you anticipating the next move.  The storyline is awesome and not so predictable.  I enjoyed reading this fast paced romance novel and plan to read other novels by Forster.<br />Reviewed by Dorothy Cooperwood	2001-12-16
My Inspiration	You Are My Sister - An Inspirational Book That Promotes Sisterhood and Spiritual Growth by Anfra is a definite must read. I really enjoyed this book. This is indeed a winner.<br />You Are My Sister by Anfra takes you on a wonderful spiritual journey of reflections and self-upliftment that humbly reminds us that we are somebody. I was very inspired and it really eased a lot of my inner stress that I had while reading the book. I feel not everyone can produce writings for inspiration and spiritual growth; it's something that has to come natural to the writer. Anfra not only captures and reflects that definition, but she naturally does \\"encourage, enlighten and empower\\" with her writings.<br />Although I had many favorites, a few elevated themselves to me as being my inspiration. \\"What's Blocking Your Blessings?\\" was a rude awakening to me and I humbly enjoyed her writing. It is a compelling reminder that we tend to overlook stress related issues that can impact the blocking of your blessings.<br />Another of my favorites was \\"Weight Problems.\\"  I realized from that passage that we have to stop, think, and come to terms of what is actually weighing us down. We have to realize that it's not always about the physical, that it's about the religious, mental, and spiritual growth and development that we must acquire within ourselves to survive the heavy burdens that we unconsciously put on ourselves.<br />I also enjoyed Anfra's poetry section. Three of my favorites were \\"Someone Else's Eyes\\" A Message From An Unborn Child\\" and \\"I Got It.\\"  All three including her other collections had me nodding my head up and down and side-to-side.  They were definitely on time.<br />Finally, the last section was what I consider a serious grand finale because this section was about YOU doing a self-inventory.  The title alone is self-explanatory - \\"To Thine Own Self Be True\\" You Are My Sister-Personal Inventory. Anfra provides you with an opportunity to now examine yourself with various questions, and exercises that can only do one thing and that is encourage you to take charge of your life.<br />Although I could go and on about my favorites,  I think words would be well spent if you get the book yourself and enjoy a magnificent collection of her writings, poems, reflections, and inspirations, that I know will do more then \\"encourage, enlighten, and empower\\" but will bring a humble \\"amen\\" \\"wow\\" and \\"thank you\\" to Anfra for sharing her spirituality and inspiration with us. You will truly enjoy this book and will want to keep it nearby for those pick me up days.

Senseless Murder	What appears to be a love story from the opening chapter quickly turns into a murder mystery grabbing your attention in this quick and fast-paced read.  Until Death Do Us Part takes us into the undercover world of drugs and racketeering in Atlanta.  Along the way we are introduced to the undercover world of the government.  How are these two entities related in the murder of a suburban wife and mother?<br />Noah is a young, educated and successful businessman who is married to Andrea.  Noah returns home from a business trip to find his wife murdered.  After an attempted murder on another resident of their sub-division, the police have their killer and close the case.  Noah, not satisfied with the answers he receives about why his wife was murdered, sets out to find who was behind the killer.<br />To aid him in his search, Noah is given the name and history of an ex-convict named Bishop by an unlikely source.  Through Noah's own devises he tracks down Micah, a strip dancer. How do these two people fit into Andrea's murder? This unlikely source also provides a tool for Micah in her search for some answers of her own. This tool is introduced early in the book and you are left to wonder its importance.<br />Bishop offers a sensitive look at his life as a poor child in the heart of Atlanta explaining why he leads the life he leads and why revenge is his answer.  This helps Noah to understand why Bishop would put his life on the line to search for Andrea's killer. Bishop explains his plight with such profound tenderness and intelligence you cannot help but root for him in his quest to make a change.<br />Some of my favorite sections within the book are Noah's daydreams and his explanations of his life with Andrea.  Noah and Andrea appeared to be two souls with like goals, brought together through love and admiration that Simpson effectively describes as their \\"flow.\\" Furthermore, Simpson does an excellent job of describing the different neighborhoods in and around Atlanta.  From the buildings, the landscape, to the racial and ethnic make up, the reader is able to capture the heart of Atlanta.<br />The only problem I had with the book was the climax appears to be unrealistic while leaving some gaps and unanswered questions. However, I truly liked this story and will read what Noah, Bishop and Micah are up to next. Until Death Do Us Part is a raw and gritty look at the realities of poverty, drugs, crime and the \\"system\\" as we know it.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reevesa.

Andria fears being alone the most and she is devastated by the breakup with her lover. Friendships are also a very important part of her life, and Robin, Andria's best friend, is right there to help Andria through her pain.<br /> Rashaun, a charcoal Black man, is living a comfortable life and carries himself as a confirmed bachelor. He once gave his heart to a woman, and she stomped all over it until it exploded. After this experience he swore to himself that he would never let anyone else get close to him again.<br /> Andria and Rashaun are two beautiful yet complex people who are drawn to each other, and the story of their relationship is an exotic, erotic, and emotional journey, that keeps the pages of this novel turning.<br /> BlackFunk was a very emotional and interesting read. The concept of the term BlackFunk fascinated me and will fascinate anyone that reads the book as well. I will not share the meaning of BlackFunk in this review because I feel that it would give away too much. I highly recommened this book; on the RAW scale it is a 4.5.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

It is a compilation of poems that range in<br />topics including relationships between black men and women, how to be<br />comfortable being yourself, and instilling self-esteem in your<br />children while they're young. It also covers the arenas of loving<br />and losing someone to death, being true to yourself, and having faith<br />in yourself and in God.<br />To discuss each of the poems in the book would take away from the<br />book, but not to mention some of my favorites would do an injustice<br />to this nice collection of poetry centered on everyday emotions and<br />feelings. Some of those that I was fond of and that &quot;stuck&quot; with me<br />are below along with my interpretation of them.<br />The Honor - teaches us to love black men despite the things they do<br />that we may not like or agree with.<br />Common Thoughts/World War Ways - these poems teach us that we<br />shouldn't focus on living up to the standards of others or on being<br />better than someone else. We should simply be ourselves and not<br />worry about what others think.<br />Kind Words - reminds us to be cordial and friendly with those we<br />encounter on a day-to-day basis. I REALLY enjoyed this one because<br />it reminds me of people you pass in hallways, stores, and other<br />places that walk by you without any sign of greeting.<br />Little Black Child - a mother's plea for her child's self-esteem. I<br />really enjoyed this poem because I believe it's important to instill<br />a sense of self-esteem in children while they're young.<br />Motion Sickness - speaks of a desire to move on with life without<br />repeating previous pain and trials of the past.<br />Back Home - talks of the good ole cooking you get back home and how<br />it feels to go back after being away for a while. This is another of<br />my favorites of the book because everyone knows there is nothing like<br />good home cooking!<br />Boomerang - teaches us to do good things even though they may not be<br />reciprocated or appreciated. The main lesson is to continue them<br />because in the end you will be rewarded and reap the benefits of your<br />kindness.<br />Faith in You - a parent's message to their child letting them know<br />that they can do anything with faith in God. Also, it tells of the<br />parent's faith that the child can do anything they set their minds to<br />do.<br />Those are only a few of the poems that are in this collection and I'm<br />sure every reader will find quite a few that personally touch them<br />and reflect their feelings about the same topics. Ms. O'Neal closes<br />the book with Lesson's Learned; short passages of lesson's she's<br />learned throughout her life. Of those listed, my favorite and one I<br />try to live by myself is: &quot;never put all of my faith into one<br />person. It is too much pressure on them and a big disappointment to<br />you.&quot;<br />I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to other poetry lovers and<br />also to those who like to reflect on life. I look forward to future<br />works by Ms. O'Neal and commend her on a job well done.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

True Love?	Ever After, debut novel of Edwardo Jackson is an unbelievable love story about a pair of African American lovers.  Nick who hails from Seattle is a graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta.  After graduation Nick moves to New York to pursue a career in banking.  He meets Jasmine, a beautiful caramel colored sister and falls madly in love with her.  Jasmine who is on the rebound has issues with her ex-boyfriend Jacques.  Nick and Jasmine's relationship is picture perfect.  Everything that the average woman dreams about such as flowers, love letters, weekend trips he does.  After dating two years Nick proposes to Jasmine but she declines.  He is devastated and makes a major decision to put the situation behind him.  Nick moves to Chicago and starts anew to work for the Harris Bank, the job is similar to what he did in New York.  One of the perks of the job is that Nick can go back to school and earn an M.B.A.<br />Nick is consumed with thoughts of Jasmine and compares every woman he meets to her. There are six Cardinal Rules of Dating that Nick uses but breaks every one of them. He dates many women but does not treat them well.  Nick meets up with Jasmine at a party one weekend in Atlanta, she has been living in Atlanta since the breakup.  They hug and kiss but Jasmine is still holding back.  Nick returns to Chicago and makes a career change from business to acting and prepares to move to San Diego.  He is finished packing and walking out of the door when the phone rings and he answers...any idea who may be calling?<br />I enjoyed reading the book but had trouble with how many times the author flipped the script from past to current.  Jackson is very descriptive with the scenes in this book.  He had several scenes where Nick actually cried.  I liked that part because he showed that men do cry.  There is a scene where Nick has written a beautiful love letter to Jasmine and it's awesome.  For a debut novel, Ever After is a good read for romance readers.<br />Reviewed by Dorothyby Dorothy	2001-11-16
What Ever Simon Wants Simon Gets	Simon says, &quot;jump,&quot; Alexander asks, &quot;how high?&quot;  The premise of Simon Says paints a grim picture of family dysfunction, political corruption and drug dealing. The prologue provides a description of Washington D.C., in the 1960's, 1970's and opens in 1974.  This is a necessary element because it provides a visual tool for the reader to grasp the surroundings of this novel.<br />For Alexander Whitney Baxter, the way out of one of DC's most notorious ghettos is through books.  Alexander spends his days in school and his nights reading and studying.  With his mother deceased and his father an emotional cripple, Alexander clings to his older brother for support. When he is offered an academic scholarship to a southern college Alexander leaves his troubled childhood behind.<br />Alexander excels in college but continues to feel out of place.  An incident occurs that changes Alexander's life.  Enter Simon Blake, the Mayor of Washington D.C. Simon is as charismatic as Alexander is gullible.  After being proclaimed a hero Alexander's life changes and he is afforded many opportunities.  After graduating from college and settling down in Washington D.C., Alexander has one more mission to complete.  It is during his investigation that he sees Simon for who he is.  Does Alexander sell his soul?  The composition of Simon and Alexander's character is complex in that they are both dark and bold.<br />While somewhat predictable, Simon Says delivers enough intrigue to keep you guessing.  The players in this novel are not who you expect them to be and you will be pleasantly surprised by the results. Collen Dixon has crafted a novel that provides the reader with some gut wrenching realities. There is no middle ground with this one; it is all or nothing. Are you ready to play?<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2001-11-16
User Error	Throughout his life whenever people have not met JC Evans standards, he control alt deletes them from his hard drive. He is a computer expert and lives his life by logic. There is no place in his logical, organized life for emotion.<br /> Jasmine Brooks, JC's neighbor, is his total opposite. She is an emotional person who takes each day as it comes. Though others see JC as different or strange, Jasmine sees someone much deeper and caring.<br /> JC is a computer whiz, and it is his knowledge of computers that puts him into Jasmine's life. Jasmine's knowledge of computers stop with the power button. JC teaches Jasmine about computers and Jasmine introduces JC to something that he didn't know existed: his emotional side. In reading this story you wonder if all of these things will compute to love.<br /> The Right Code by Sharon Holmes could have been a good book, but the story goes in far too many different directions  and experiences major system failures that ultimately hurt the book. On the RAW scale it is a 2.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-11-16
Where's Ralph?	The title of this book suggests that it is a story of a Black Police Chief, his rise in ranks, and his views on various political issues.  Although the book does briefly outline Ralph's life, this seems to be the secondary focus of the book.  As soon as you begin reading, it quickly becomes apparent that this book first and foremost serves as a platform for the author, Ralph's brother-in-law, to put his own political views in print.  The author does this to such an extent that at times Ralph's story is overshadowed by verbose historical and political discussions that were quite loosely related.  In addition, the reader is faced with the challenge of weeding through lists of people who knew Ralph at various points in his life.  The introduction of these additional people would have been less tedious had the author linked those persons to Ralph in a more meaningful way, for example, re-telling a story that demonstrated their relationship.<br />The most refreshing portions of this book were the letters scattered throughout the book that Ralph had written to his wife.  Ralph wrote these letters while serving in the military or while away for job training.  The letters gave a true sense of Ralph's personality and his strong commitment to his family, friends and excellence.<br />Ralph Cothran appears to be a man who overcame tremendous economic challenges to eventually rise to the position of Police Chief.  He seems to have been a man of great character and personal strength.  It is unfortunate that this book didn't put more of a focus on the life of the man for whom it was named.  I was disappointed that Ralph never had a chance to write his own story before he died.  If you can weed through the lengthy historical discussions, you will find a sketch of an inspiring man that you will want to learn more about.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2001-11-16
No Greater Love	Interesting title and my first thought was 'rest in peace', then<BR>I opened the book and started to read.  R.I.P. is the story of four <BR>unlikely students, Rashondra, Indigo, Priscilla and Walter who met <BR>by chance because Walter needed a study group and he picked these <BR>three freshman ladies.  <br />On too many occasions Walter witnessed the trio rip a brotha's ego to <BR>shreds, so he fondly nicknamed the threesome RIP, and when you saw one <BR>you saw three. The surprise was that their bond was so tight, because <BR>they were completely opposite in personalities and backgrounds. <BR>Rashondra was a bonafide gurl from da' hood and though she was <BR>determined to leave it all behind, she could not turn her back on her <BR>Mom and her brother. Indigo was the most well rounded of the three, <BR>the product of a middle income family with a strong religious <BR>background.  Priscilla was as her name implied prissy and ladylike, <BR>her parents gave her whatever she wanted. Though Walter was somewhat of <BR>a player, he became their big brother and they loved it.  This story <BR>took you through four years of college and about six years of life after <BR>college.  The group was always there for each other and they still<BR>shared major holidays, birthdays and annual college reunions. <br />Then Indigo witnessed something tragic and she did not know what to do<BR>about it, while the information she had would vindicate a husband for <BR>one of her friends it would indicate the brother for the other.  When <BR>she finally went to the police to tell her story, the group was ripped <BR>apart.  Two years later Walter is ready for the feud to end and he vowed <BR>to get them back together no matter what it took; it took a tragedy but <BR>was that even enough?<br />The story jumped around a bit, and at times I was not sure of whose <BR>voice I was hearing, but this was an enjoyable read and the dialogue was <BR>reminiscent of terms I thought forgotten.  A good freshman output from <BR>Ms. Wash, I look forward to reading future works by her.   <br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-11-16
Snap, Crackle, Pop!	The front cover says 'Beyond Sensuous' and that is a true<br />description of Indigo After Dark: II. This volume is written<br />as two separate books and each book shares about 10 short<br />sexual exploits.<br /><br />'Brown Sugar Diaries' by Dolores Bundy is a sensual view<br />through the eyes of raw, uninhibited and sexually free women.<br />The escapades are a potpourri of explicit, vividly portrayed<br />erocticism that take you on an exotic journey with characters<br />that go beyond..., to unbridled pleasure.<br />'The Forbidden Art of Desire' by Cole Riley shows that sensual<br />view through a man's eyes.  Riley offers a variety of<br />circumstances, that are so intensely arousing that you are<br />not able to determine if it's lust or love. The one thing in<br />all of these exploits is that 'desire' is the key ingredient<br />for a simmering, sensual hot bed of fulfillment.<br />I advise you to heed the caution in the front:<br />&quot;Reading this book causes extreme stimulation, lust<br />and exquisite languor&quot;, and then read at your own risk.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-11-16
The Sins of the Father	The title, Hand Me Down Heartache, reflects the contents of Butler's novel so appropriately that one cannot help but wonder if you are truly a product of your environment.<br />For Nina Lander, graduating from college, living with her parents to save money and searching for her dream job is the right thing to do.  Only she discovers that all is not right in her childhood household.  Enter Maurice, a professional basketball player, who sweeps Nina off her feet only to verbally and physically abuse her.  Nina's expectations of love and commitment are so low that in her mind Maurice's treatment is normal; it is all that she knows.  Coupled with the fact that her brother Brice is a carbon copy of her father, Nina feels she has no other choice.  That is until Leo enters the picture.  Leo is everything that Nina could want in a man but Maurice's deviant pull and hold over her is so strong she repeats the same mistakes as her mother.<br />Throughout the novel we are privy to Nina's innermost thoughts.  Nina can verbalize Maurice's mistreatment of her and her father's mistreatment of her mother but for some reason she cannot walk away and leave well enough alone.  Nina and her mother learn some invaluable lessons from some of the most unsuspecting characters within the novel.<br />Butler has crafted a novel filled with a message that speaks to men and women both young and old. She provides a straightforward account of pure desperation that will pull you into Nina's life.  While there are some very neat closures all are not, which is reality at its best. Butler has demonstrated that she is as talented as they come because this story stands on its own.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2001-11-16
Getting Up Again	College graduation day is a time we all dream of.  After years of hard work, finally the big day arrives.  But what happens after graduation?  This is the question TJ Butler addresses in the novel Hand Me Down Heartache.<br />Nina has finally earned her degree in journalism, but now she has to grapple with what her life will become outside of an academic setting.  As she struggles to find herself professionally, she is also forced to discover who she is as a daughter, sister and woman.  Slowly, she begins to recognize how her own parent's relationship has marred her views on men, relationships and marriage. Nina's father has cheated on his wife for years.  In addition, Nina has watched her brother cheat on and toss aside girlfriend after girlfriend.<br />Maurice, who at first sight seems to be the man of Nina's dreams, turns out to be a nightmare.  Leo, who is practically a knight in shining armor, seems too good to be true.  Which man will Nina choose to be in a relationship with?<br />When Nina discovers that her mother has been fighting a terrible illness for quite a while, suddenly her problems with men and her career seem insignificant.  She realizes that she was so caught up in her own drama that she neglected someone that she loved dearly.  Nina puts all of the things in her life on hold so that she can be there for her mother and the two women grow tremendously.<br />This is a story about growth, sacrifice and acceptance.  We watch Nina make good and bad choices and we see her involved in both good and unhealthy relationships.  The book is filled with lessons about self-respect, overcoming adversity and personal responsibility.  Butler's writing makes it easy to step into Nina's world and identify with her and the other characters.  Most importantly we learn that it is never too late to learn from our mistakes and that some things are too precious to sacrifice.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2001-11-16
FAT people: faithful, available &amp; teachable (from the book)	Youth Leaving the Church was divided into several different aspects of why they are leaving and how to prevent it. It is filled with quotes, endnotes and scriptures from several different books in the Bible. Dr. Henderson brings up a point from the Bible that makes a good point if it works. \\"Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it&quot;<br />There are many reasons given throughout this book, one of them that rings true to me and my situation was my parents never forced upon my attending church, like, my studies in school or respecting my elders. I wonder would I be more likely to venture into church more than I do now, if my parents had given me reason to go. The author also references how parents encourage children to entertain themselves with toys before prayer. It's sad to think there's a possibility that this might be true. What influences do children have to encourage them to go to church?<br />Youth Leaving the Church is a book for parents, teachers, and anyone who wants to help create greater values and a higher love of the lord within our youth.<br /><br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-11-16
Got Melanin?	A Quote from West Ford \\"Tell your children, tell them about the Old General. But don't tell nobody else' cause white folks won't accept it.\\"<br />My initial thoughts on this book were \\"why did I volunteer to review this,\\" I wasn't partial to history, could barely keep up in school. I progressed to the foreword and realized this might be interesting. After completing the foreword, I noticed there were portraits of George Washington at age 25, West Ford age 21 and his mother Venus Ford. I was totally intrigued. The resemblance West Ford had to George Washington his father, was uncanny.<br />I am sure the question at the forefront of your mind is how? So let me start there. Venus Ford was a mulatto slave for Massa John Washington, Master George's brother.  Massa Johns' son Augustine was killed in a gun accident. The Washington family was grieving over the lost of Young Augustine, Master George's nephew. At the request of Massa John, Venus was asked to comfort the Old General. Venus understood comfort to mean lighting a fire and warming some bricks for his bed. Massa Johns' next words startled Venus, \\"Ah...Master George needs warming of another kind.\\" After that one night whenever he visited Bushfield or when Venus went with her Mistress to Mount Vernon, Venus became his sex slave.<br />What was so different about this story from all the other influential white men who bedded mulatto slaves and wives of sharecroppers? Nothing. What's interesting is how the Fords kept their family secret legacy alive. The prologue opens with Elise Ford Allen, facing her 79th birthday and choosing the \\"special ones\\" who would continue the legacy of the family. Each generation had a chronicler, who would continue the legacy. How neat is that. I for one am happy they did this, imagine not ever knowing West Ford's story.<br />This book is for everyone, young or old. History tells us that our first president and first lady birthed no children together. George Washington's first born was born of a slave not of Martha's womb. This was a different read for me. The author Linda Allen Bryant found a way to write about history and made it entertaining. At times I forgot this was a story of West Ford, George Washington's first born.<br />Reviewed by Missyof a slave not of Martha's womb. This was a different read for me.

Soulful Stories	What better person to write a collection of short fictional stories about<br />the lives of African American women who're struggling to survive in the<br />rural South than the author, Crystal E. Wilkinson whose debut novel,<br />Blackberries, Blackberries is a winner.  Wilkinson self-described Black<br />Country girl was born and raised in rural Kentucky and teaches creative<br />writing at the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning in Lexington,<br />Kentucky.<br />This book is compiled of eighteen stories in which African American<br />Southern women speak about their trials, tribulations, sorrows, laughter<br />and tears.  Each story told in narrative form has its own level of<br />emotion with uniqueness.  It's about truth telling and how each woman<br />deals with her problems.  You can feel the emotions of these women as you<br />read their stories.  Some of my favorites were Humming Back yesterday a<br />story about a woman who looks over her life from twenty years of hiding,<br />Waiting for the Reaper about a lady who is old and is still waiting for<br />ole man death, and the best story Peace of Mind about a single mom who<br />has a couple weeks to herself from her three young sons who are away at<br />summer camp.  This story is hilarious and seasoned with soul.<br />Wilkinson's stories may be fictional but feel so real.  Only a true<br />Southerner could write such stories.

Unconditional Love	Pretend that you're a young girl growing up in the 70s with dreams of <BR>getting out of a poor neighborhood, going to college, and doing <BR>something with your life.  Sounds like it's achievable; especially <BR>for 16-year-old Peggy Dana who has just received a basketball <BR>scholarship, right?? Wrong!    <br />In the midst of Peg's drama is her own mother; overbearing, <BR>manipulative and lost in despair because she's not quite over the <BR>death of her husband who died when Peg was a child.  Because of this, <BR>Peg's Mom holds her children hostage to her feelings of resentment, <BR>offering them nothing in the form of emotional support and love.   <BR>After much hesitation and even more strife from her Mom, Peg accepts <BR>the scholarship and heads off to college. <br />Because of her delay in accepting the scholarship, there isn't room <BR>available on campus, so she is housed off campus with Martin and Doris <BR>&quot;Missus&quot; Ellen, an elderly black couple that <BR>live near campus.  This is where Peg finds her &quot;surrogate parents.&quot;   <BR>Despite their different races and ages, they immediately bond with <BR>each other creating a warm, loving relationship that enables Peg to cross <BR>over into adult life.  Initially, Mr. Ellen teases Peg incessantly <BR>and tries to educate her on Black History, but Peg has some of her own <BR>teasing for Mr. Ellen up her sleeves having to do with a Black <BR>History figure who has been dead for hundreds of years...only Mr. Ellen <BR>doesn't know it, he just pretends he knows all about Black History. <BR>As a result of the teasings, they grow closer together and Mr. Ellen <BR>continues his teachings and ramblings about the &quot;Cycle of Life,&quot; <BR>while Missus Ellen becomes the mom that Peg never had. <br />To the Ellens, Peg is their &quot;child&quot; and Nan Devincent Hayes does a <BR>wonderful job of introducing us to the characters and their <BR>relationships with one another.  We go through Peggy growing up, her <BR>first date, more trials and tribulations with her Mom, her first time <BR>getting drunk and staying out all night, her &quot;slip-up&quot; after going to <BR>a college party, her first interaction with Gramps, Mr. Ellen's Dad, <BR>her heart-breaking, life-threatening experience at the hands of George, <BR>her Mom's live-in boyfriend, and so much more! <br />We are able to see peeks into what it's like to be an elderly family <BR>getting used to having a young person living with them, how they deal <BR>with Peg not being black, and how their friends, neighbors, and <br />family members react to them housing someone who doesn't look like <BR>them.  We also see that sometimes, though we are born to our parents, they <BR>don't always have our best interests in mind, so we have to follow our hearts <BR>and do what our dreams outline for us.  Lastly, we are able to see some of the old time beliefs<BR>in affect and the true unconditional love shown to you by parents... or those who have signed on to be your &quot;parents.&quot;    <br />I could go on and on about this wonderful display of racial harmony <BR>and love extending beyond racial barriers, but I'll let you judge for <BR>yourself as you travel to 22 Friar Street.  This is definitely a well <BR>written, exciting, page-turning novel that will leave you full of <BR>emotions; especially after reading the cliff-hanging, breath-taking, <BR>don't wanna-believe, ending.  It'll leave you feeling exactly what <BR>the characters felt...loved unconditionally. I highly recommend this book to <BR>EVERY ONE:  black, white, young or old.  This book <BR>will definitely touch your heart and renew your spirit. <br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal	2001-11-16
THE HEAT IS ON	Richard Whelan is the National Security Adviser. A Harvard graduate, he landed the position not only because he is smart but also because he was best friends with the current President's deceased son. Richard has been dating Mary Jacobs, the daughter of a very powerful man and one of the POTUS (President of the United States) biggest supporters. One night, while trailing Mary home from a social where they had a public altercation, Richard is pulled over by bogus cops for Driving While Black. By the time he arrives at Mary's place, she is dead and the set-up begins.<br />Just like in real-life politics, everyone is hell bent on covering their own behinds and Richard finds himself stripped of his career, his money, and if certain elements have their way, his life. It is up to him and an ex-lover, Bettina--another high-ranking government official, to prove his innocence. As the chips begin to fall, so do additional bodies, and Richard is the prime suspect for all of the murders.<br />Fans of Tom Clancy and Sidney Sheldon and people who curl up in front of the TV with a tub of popcorn to watch movies like No Way Out and Patriot Games will appreciate this novel more than most. It is refreshing to see an African American author tackle the political thriller genre and Fullilove does it with expertise.	2001-11-16

When you're reading her words she drags you into the inner-city streets of her shack called home. Fay has the innocence of her youth, but the spirit, wisdom and insight of a seasoned woman. The hard knocks that she endures only makes her stronger mentally. I really enjoyed growing up with Fay over a 16-year period.<br />Joyce Palmer had me laughing and crying along with Fay, Flo and their mother Miss Voy. I cannot say that this novel is for a certain sect of people for it is not. Everyone will get something from this book. One of my favorite quotes from Fay's teacher, which helped her take care of her business was this: \\"Only Education Can Change Your Situation.\\"<br />This book is definitely a page-turner. I was in Jamaica, barefoot, walking by the street gossipers and talking patois, with every page I turned. Fay is no longer hungry, poor in pain or abused.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-11-16

Who's Delivering Murder?	Kansas City homicide detective Joe Johnson experiences some serious postal blues when he and his partner's wife are taken hostage at Kansas City's main post office. During this hostage situation Joe discovers the very lax security at this large and important facility and sees that this is a situation that was just waiting to happen.<br /> After Joe saves the day at the post office, he and his partner Vernon, are teamed up with the FBI to solve the serial killings of local prostitutes. Along the way Joe and Vernon encounter old friends, temptation, and danger.<br /> Postal Blues was a very predictable and at times unrealistic book. The storyline started out good but the author tried to make Joe, the main character, too perfect, and that took away from the book.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-11-16
The Reality of Relationships 101	Two pages into this book in large bold font is the word &quot;CAUTION: and it's underlined with this message: This book uses strong language and has been rated AG for All Good.\\" Girl is told in several voices of the dissed and pissed woman. Within each poem women can find their own reality and courage. All the poems have a message for women, some are the humorous truth, while others are a subtle wake up call.<br />The author has taken a few of her poems right from our childhood nursery books, with them she has added an adult twist, one example is Little Miss Muphet.A simple little poem that each of us have at one time in our lives experienced. What's so fantastic about Ms. Lawson's poetry is you can identify, you can feel these words resonating from your experiences.<br />This book is for any woman who's partner ever cheated on them; lonely and settling for that nothing that once shined like a diamond. Women let's join together and read this book for the courage and serenity our soul needs and get some laughter for our hearts.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-11-16

A Refreshing Look at Integrity	Messages are abundant in Promises Beyond Jordan.  Beginning in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Atlanta, to Birmingham, Alabama and back again, is the tale of integrity, commitment or lack there of, love, hope and redemption.  \\"Have you ever loved someone that you never had,\\" opens chapter one and is the catalyst for this story.<br />George Landris is the dreadlock wearing, spirit-filled, eloquent speaking pastor of Wings of Grace Faith Ministry Church.  Theresa Jordan is a minister's daughter and the fiancé of Pastor Landris.  She is selfish and often times her behavior is inexplicable.  In the mix we have Bishop Richard Jordan (Theresa's father), his wife Beatrice and Lena Patterson.  These three individuals have kept a long held secret from Theresa that seeks to destroy the family unit.  However, they believed that harboring this secret was the right thing to do in hopes of creating a normal childhood for Theresa.<br />Nine days before his wedding Pastor Landris takes off for Birmingham, Alabama without informing Theresa as to why. During this fateful trip Pastor Landris is reunited with an old friend that fuels Theresa's insecurities.  Theresa's insecurities cause her to loose her faith and she too has a secret that must be kept.  During Pastor Landris' trip and upon his arrival, we are left wondering about the identity of this mysterious individual and why he will not reveal this information to Theresa.  The answers to these questions are answered within the nine days leading up to the wedding and beyond.  <br />Sometimes life brings trouble and offers little to no solutions and God's answers are not easy to understand.  Promises Beyond Jordan demonstrates the adage of faith, being true to yourself and honoring a commitment once it is made.  The sermons, church members and other church related activities are as entertaining as they are real.  This is very good Christian fiction read with enough drama to keep you captivated.<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2001-11-16
Motivating and Interesting!	Derrick Hayes defines a Derricknym as &quot;an acronym with a touch of Derrick where words are motivational messages.&quot;  I think the definition accurately describes this sort of dictionary-like book that goes through the alphabet from A to Z...inspiring, motivating, and having the potential to change the lives of those who read it.  In addition to giving the word (acronym), Hayes goes on to give a short passage explaining the meaning.<br />Some very impactful ones for me are listed below, but you'll have to pick up the book to find out their meaning.  ANGEL (Always Notice the Good In Everyone's Life), BOOK (Build on Original Knowledge), COLOR (Communicate Openly to Leave out Racism), LAUGH (Life Allows Us to Get Help), LOVE (Let Others Visit your Experience), PROFIT (People Realizing Our Future Is Today), and WHY (Worshipping Helps You).<br />This is a fun book that also manages to teach its readers the values of life.  Pick it up and see for yourself and be sure to share with your family and friends; especially our children as Hayes focuses a lot of his seminars and motivational speaking on the children in our community.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Choices	Life is a series of choices but what path will we choose?  This is one of the important themes of this book.  Alphonso struggles day after day to find a legitimate job with no success.  As a result, he is faced with feelings of guilt and inadequacy, especially when he has to tell the live-in girlfriend who is supporting them; he still has no job prospects.  By fate he is offered the chance to start selling drugs.  Initially, he continues looking for a legitimate job but after a few more failures he and his best friend Tony enter &quot;the life&quot; and start selling drugs.<br />Terrance, better known as &quot;T&quot;, has lived in poverty for most of his life.  After his father left, his mother took on two sometimes three jobs trying to support the family.  But with other brothers and sisters in the house there was never enough money, food, or time to go around.  &quot;T&quot; learned early on that in order to survive in his family and on the streets he had to be tough and hustle to get what he wanted.  It is no surprise that although he is young he too gets involved in dealing drugs, first as a &quot;runner&quot;.<br />Although this story is a fictional account, it deals with a number of important social issues such as education, domestic and community violence, child abuse, teen pregnancy and most obviously alcohol and drug abuse.  Booker T. creates multidimensional characters that you cannot help but feel for even when you don't agree with the choices they make.  The author really illustrates how difficult circumstances can help lead us down the wrong path without overlooking the personal responsibility we all must take for the choices we make.<br />The only disappointing thing about this book is that it seems to jump around.  One minute you are reading about one storyline and suddenly you find yourself in the middle of another.  Although you may find yourself flipping back to make sure you didn't skip a page be patient because the author will eventually tie everything together into a coherent whole.  This is a wonderful story that really illustrates some of the challenges faced by many young African American males and their families.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seayerything together into a coherent whole.

Can You See The Love?	Sarafina Jones is a young Black woman living in Boston and attending New England University. She is trying to live up to her father's dreams of her having a career in the banking industry. The only problem with this picture is that Sarafina has dreams of her own. She is an accomplished college DJ who dreams of making it big at a radio station some day.<br /> Benjamin Taylor Freeman is a college senior working diligently to complete his thesis and also trying to remain a part of the environment around him. Ben Taylor as he is also known is also part of a group called ACT that is very involved in the Black community that surrounds the college.<br /> Neither Ben Taylor nor Sarafina were looking for love, but we always seem to find what we aren't looking for. At first sight they both knew that they have deep affection for one another. They are total opposites and are as different as night and day, but at times that seems to bring them closer together.<br /> Vision by author Oluyemisi Olutu was a pretty good book, my only complaint is that the book did not really have any excitement in it.

This story was not about drama or demons that needed to be<br />conquered, it was a quiet story about everyday life and about how<br />we push aside the things that are most important.  Communication<br />was the key that opened the door to their night of magic.<br />This was a good sharing of what not to do in a marriage.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-11-16

We Shall Overcome	Every Bitter Thing Sweet is a journey into how the past can either inspire you or limit your future.  Identities are questioned, futures are planned as each characters' story is told. Resonating throughout is how the human spirit becomes our strength; strength in knowledge and strength in character.<br />Every Bitter Thing Sweet continues four years later where A Thirst for Rain left off.  Main characters Odile and Rory were childhood friends until a tragedy occurred.  Now, four years later, they come in contact with each other carrying the scars of the past.  Their worlds are entangled and how they navigate through is the premise of this story.  Odile wrestles with her independence and is determined not to have a man label who she is or what her future will be.  Rory, described as a mammoth, struggles with his own demons vowing not to become an abusive man like his father. We also meet the parents, grandparent, sibling and significant others of the main characters.  By examining their stories and histories we are able to understand the complex nature of Odile and Rory. When the story ended I found myself hoping that Odile and Rory would find peace and happiness in their future; they deserved it<br />The energy in this tale comes from the author's depiction of native life in Trinidad.  You feel Trinidad and all of its offerings from the people, food, trees, streets, waters and buildings. The reader has the opportunity to visualize the tourist sections, the suburban areas and the bustling city life of Trinidad.  Roslyn Carrington's play on words is fascinating which in my book makes her a great storyteller!<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves	2001-10-24
Captivating Story of Pride	The three books of Cora, Emma and Parris make up the novel Rhythms where you have four distinct stories of love.  Stories that include the elements of pride, racial identity, class, forgiveness and dreams that unfold for better and for worse.<br />During the 1920's along the Delta in Mississippi, Pearl and Reverend Joshua Harvey raise their daughter Cora with a staunch Christian upbringing.  Cora, a gifted singer, has a desire of moving up north to pursue a career as a singer. Growing up, Cora is influenced by the likes of Bessie Smith and other infamous rhythm and blues singers of the time. Cora follows her dream, never having it materialize and returns to Rudell, Mississippi with a secret.<br />Emma is the daughter that Cora bores.  While not gifted with the voice of her mother, Emma too has dreams to move to the big city.  Her dreams are in the form of living with freedom.  Freedoms that are not afforded to \\"coloreds\\" at the time.  Emma passes and lives a life of privilege after marrying a rich Italian military officer.<br />Parris is the offspring of Emma who is blessed with the voice of her grandmother.  Cora raises Parris in Rudell and she too has aspirations of leaving for the big city to pursue a singing career.  Cora offers Parris the one thing that she did not give Emma as a child-a mother's love. Parris is the one that provides the strength and the destiny for the women and the men.<br />Joshua, David, Michael, and Nick are the men portrayed in Rhythms.  Each man is strong in his own way while providing the women in their lives unconditional love and support.<br />The descriptions of Cora and Parris singing spirituals, blues, jazz and Nick playing the saxophone adds a natural vitality to the story. The historical elements and the descriptive prose of Rhythms offers the reader a chance to visualize Rudell and bright lights of Chicago and New York.  Having family that originated along the Delta and visiting that area as a child made for an interesting and memorable read.  Rhythms is a 5 RAW style!<br />Reviewed by Dawn R. Reevesmemorable read.

Coming together	'Between Brothers', my initial thoughts were this will be<br />just another account of the ups and downs of fraternity<br />life on a college campus. Though the story started slow,<br />I was soon aware that this was more than a college novel,<br />it was a story about the growth of four young men in their<br />senior year at Highland University.<br />Terence, Larry, Brandon and OJ shared a house and a<br />moderate friendship but the one thing they had in<br />common was the organization they belonged to. This group<br />wanted to give something back to the community, so they<br />volunteered hours each week as tutors and hopefully<br />role models at The Ellis Community Center. The<br />center was located in a low income area of Washington<br />D.C.<br /><br />The center had lost most of its funding from the D.C.<br />government and Sheryl Gibson, the director of the<br />center was at wits end.  The property had become<br />prime real estate and someone wanted Sheryl and the<br />center gone. A partnership had been formed between<br />a local businessman with too much money to waste. A<br />former D.C. councilman on the take, who had personal<br />ties with Sheryl. And a drug world investment banker<br />from the streets of D.C, who had been one of Sheryl's<br />students at the center.  Each of the three had much<br />to gain if they could close Ellis.<br />The survivorship of the center hinged on the four<br />young men, as members of the Board of Trustees they<br />pledged to solicit financial donations, what they<br />learned  was the shortage of money was not Ellis' only<br />problem. The determination and the tenacity of the four<br />friends as they fought desperately to save Ellis was<br />commendable.  And as they lost themselves in the battle,<br />they were forced to grow beyond the 'visual' and were<br />discovering the joys of what really matters in life.<br />This really was more than just a college read.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-10-17

Marriage Survival	After the Vows is a wonderful love anthology by three wonderful<br />writers that we should truly watch for in whatever literary<br />writings they will be doing in the future. I enjoyed each story<br />and all three will give you much food for thought in reflecting<br />on what marriages are truly all about.<br />The first story titled, Time Enough For Love by Leslie Esdaile,<br />had me truly relating in many aspects to what Alexandra was<br />feeling and the emptiness of her marriage. Alexandra and Edward<br />started off with a wonderful marriage; they loved each other<br />very much. They came together with children from previous<br />marriages and they both felt in the beginning, that this marriage<br />was what they both longed for. Unfortunately, the marriage,<br />to Alexandra was becoming too much and too routine. On top of<br />working each day, the children, the house cleaning, the cooking<br />was left up to Alexandra with no help from Edward or the children.<br />He felt his job was to make sure they saved as much money<br />as possible and to waste not one penny on anything. To<br />Alexandra, this was not the life she longed for and she didn't<br />want to continue in it. Will Alexandra make a decision she<br />will regret?<br />The second story titled, Something So Right by T.T. Henderson,<br />was truly a story that any reader could relate to and understand<br />Camille's determination to end her marriage and move on.

Are You On The List?	The Beauvilles are an old, powerful and rich family who controls the town of Sugartree. The power that the family has over the town is like a toxic chemical cloud. The late patriarch of the Beauville family, Pierre, was a millionaire and a very hard and vindictive man who liked to see people suffer. After Pierre's death his sons expected to inherit his fortune, and they would but it would not be easy.<br /> There are four Beauville sons:Francois, Gerard, Rene and Leonard. Their father's will had very specific stipulations. These stipulations were: all of the sons had to be married by the time the youngest son, Leonard turned 21. They had to marry a woman who was on the list that was created when they were children. And the weddings had to be in the family wedding chapel and there could be no guests. The women's parents were paid a lump sum of money so that their daughters would marry Beauville men. Each son would inherit over 20 million dollars as long as they remained married for 3  years.<br /> The women chosen from the list are: Yvette Collins, a smart headstrong attorney, she will marry Gerard. Shell Davis a shy, timid young woman with a secret, she will marry Rene. Tammy Duyden the towns school teacher will marry Francois. Each of these women have their own reasons for marrying one of the Beauville sons. Leornard is so enamored with one of his brother's fiancee's that who he would marry is in question.<br /> The List is a constant rollarcoaster ride with the story rocking you from page to page.

Picket Fence Dreams	\\"The urban ventriloquist\\" is how Michael Datcher author of Raising Fences refers to his self and others who look like him. Raising Fences is Michael Datchers' memoirs of growing up without a father. The book starts with Michael retrieving his birth certificate from the mailbox hoping for answers to legitimize him as a man. Who is my father, a question that lingers over the heads of many brothers in the neighborhood? What Michael gets instead is a space marked \\"Father's Full Name\\" is \\"Legally Withheld\\".<br />Michael's character was not much different from the men we know, what made his story different was his bravery and his personal belief system. He overcame his stuttering and his desire for the white picket fences was beginning to materialize, until he was informed again by a piece of paper that it was a lie. During Michael's search for a father, he found The Church of Christ, his faith grew and his stuttering subsided. The Cult Awareness Network distributed leaflets, to students warning them about the church. Michael was afraid if he left the church God would be mad, so he stayed a while longer.<br />My favorite part of this poetic probe was Michael never did find his father, what he did find was a community. Within the community was the World Stage Family; from them he got poetry, friends, family and a writing workshop. Michael went on to become a husband, and a published writer of poems and essays.<br />This book is for everyone, but specifically for all the brothers out there who have had chipmunks chewing at the picket fence. This was an excellent read and I will be giving this as Christmas gifts to my male sibling, with a card from Uncle Remus: Each One Teach One..<br />Missy, RAW Reviewer	2001-10-12
A Self-Help History Lesson	In order to make progress in the future one must first<br />understand the past.  This is the premise of the book Lifting<br />Voices by P.M. Fisher.  The book is a collection of her own<br />poetry as well as quotes from a number of note worthy<br />political and literary figures of African descent.  Intermingled<br />in a brief outline of African American history we find related<br />words from persons such as Frederick Douglass, Booker T.<br />Washington, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King,<br />Malcolm X, Lorraine Hansberry and Nikki Giovanni.<br />Fisher starts out by discussing the colors red, green and<br />black.  She notes the symbolic importance of each of these<br />colors for African Americans and explains them in a historical<br />context.  She discusses historically important events and<br />issues such as, the Million Man March, Million Woman March, the<br />Civil Rights Movement, and Education. After establishing the<br />importance of our history, the author uses this information to<br />establish a blueprint for the continuing struggle to uplift<br />African Americans.  For example, the color red represents<br />the continuing struggle for our people.  Next, the author<br />highlights Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, Crispus Attucks and<br />others, demonstrating how they struggled to improve the<br />condition of Blacks in America.  Then she uses their<br />struggles to encourage us, by reminding the reader that if these<br />people could struggle and have an impact so can we.<br />According to the author, it is our responsibility to first learn<br />to love ourselves and in loving ourselves we develop the<br />capacity to love others.  Then we must have strong healthy<br />marriages and then we must work to be good and active parents.<br />Through her poetry and writings, Fisher outlines some of the<br />things we can do in order to live up to our responsibilities.<br />We are encouraged to appreciate &quot;little words&quot; such as faith,<br />joy, love and hope.  Further, we are called to embrace our<br />history and be active participants in the improvement of our<br />current position and future.  This book is easy to read, well<br />organized and inspiring.  I found myself trying to think of ways<br />to share the book with youth and adults alike.  Although the<br />book doesn't delve into a detailed history lesson, it highlights<br />the accomplishments of a number of Africans and African<br />Americans and leaves you wanting to go and learn more about<br />them.  The mix of poetry and prose gives the book a unique pulse<br />that makes you want to keep reading.  I believe this book can<br />truly inspire the young and the old to work towards building a<br />strong future for African Americans.

The Lady Stands Alone	Melinda Rodgers is a 29-year old widow. Her late husband was Prescott Rodgers one of Ellicot City's wealthiest and most prominent citizens. Many of the town's citizens view Melinda as a gold digger because Prescott was in his 60s and Melinda hadn't even reached age 30 yet. They thought this despite the fact that when Melinda married Prescott that she continued at her teaching job. When Prescott pasesd away Melinda not only lost her husband she lost her best friend.<br /> Blake Hunter was Prescott's attorney and is the executor of Prescott's estate, he viewed Melinda pretty much the same as the rest of the town did. Blake had a hard time even being around Melinda because despite the fact that he thought she was a gold digger he was in love with her, and it would take every part of his being to fight his feelings.<br /> The stipulations of Prescott's will were very specific: Melinda must set up a foundation for literacy in Ellicot City and she must get married within as year, Melinda was very hurt and felt betrayed that she had to do these things to gain her late husband's inheritance. Melinda and Prescott were very close and she felt that he was trying to hurt her by throwing these curve balls into his will.<br /> As if the terms of the will aren't enough Melinda has to deal with her domineering preacher father who feels that he deserves part of her inheritance, Blake's animosity towards her, the whole town gossiping behind her back and men coming out of the woodwork to marry her for the inheritance. These issues however do not prove to be her biggest challenge: fighting her feelings for Blake prove to be her biggest fight.<br /> Gwynne Forster has once again created a masterpiece and I can hardly wait for her next offering.

Irresistible Intrigue	The young, seductive woman, Mary Jane Jenkins had a way with men.  Her <BR>thick, yet attractive body was like a drug that many of the men she was <BR>involved with, just couldn't get enough of.  A victim of physical and <BR>sexual abuse since childhood, Mary Jane had a lot of painful skeletons <BR>in the closet known as her life.  Instead of dealing with her emotional baggage, <BR>Mary Jane chose to lock it away.  She used her mistreated and <BR>sexually exploited body as a tool to get what she needed to support <BR>herself and her two young children, Sapphire and Gerald.    Tragically, <BR>Mary Jane's painful past and turbulent lifestyle resulted in her <BR>untimely murder.<br />As far as Detective Benjamin McIntosh of the Odelot Police Department <BR>is concerned, Mary Jane's murder is an open and shut case.  Perry <BR>Rogers, Mary Jane's boyfriend, was being held in custody for the murder <BR>and there was plenty of evidence to implicate him.  Perry's mother, <BR>desperately searching for a way to vindicate her son, hires Private <BR>Investigator Mick Hart to look into the case.  And thus, the story <BR>unfolds.  <br />Lawrence Christopher takes us on a painful journey through Mary's life, <BR>with Mick Hart as the tour guide.  We learn about Mary's difficult life <BR>and about several of the other men that were a part of it.  Mick has to <BR>weed through a growing list of suspects with the hopes of finding out <BR>the truth behind Mary's murder.  Did Perry really kill Mary or was <BR>someone else responsible?  This question will have you turning page <BR>after page in this novella.  <br />Christopher has done an excellent job creating a mystery that once you <BR>start, you won't want to put down.  In spite of the fact that Mary was <BR>killed before the story begins, you will finish this book feeling like <BR>you know her personally.  This story is both seductive and filled with <BR>intrigue from beginning to end.  Although this story is relatively <BR>short, the plot is thoroughly developed with lots of twists and turns <BR>leading up to an even more surprising ending.  I truly enjoyed this <BR>suspenseful yet spiritually uplifting book.  As an added bonus, there <BR>is a short story called &quot;Dog 'Em: A Mick Hart Mystery that is equally <BR>as pleasant to read.  I give this book a RAW rating of 5.      <br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay	2001-10-09
WITHOUT A DOUBT, A MUST-READ FOR ANYONE IN A RELATIONSHIP	In a word, Married Men is &quot;EXCELLENT.&quot; The four main characters (Wil, Allen, Kyle, and Jay) are so well developed that you feel like they live down the street or work with you. Wil is happily married but ends up the victim of a sick practical joke when his wife finds some shady evidence and kicks him out of the house. Jay, an eternal playboy, cheats on his wife Kendra for sport but ends up being turned out by a college coed. Kyle is struggling to deal with the complications of an interracial marriage after realizing that his wife does not truly comprehend the plight of the black male. Allen is torn between his overprotective mother and a gold-digging girlfriend determined to get the ring, which she eventually does.<br />All four of these men think they have it made but quickly discover that women have a say-so in relationships also. I feel this book is important because it will teach a lot of men that love is indeed a two-way street and while they often assume that they are running things, that is not even the case. I love to see intelligent, successful black males portrayed in novels. That is something rarely seen until recent years. I am doubly glad to see black male authors creating them because that makes them all the more realistic.<br />Just like Lookin' For Luv, Married Men is an entertaining, humorous, enlightening novel, only better. Carl Weber is fine-tuning his craft and it is almost scary to think about how awesome his next book, Baby Momma Drama, will be. All I know is that I will be the first one in line to get a copy. Married Men is a must-read and one of my top picks of the year.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-10-09
Where's Your Line?	There's a very thin line between so many of life's opposite<br />emotions.  And this story touched on several of them. The<br />family secrets are so potent, they are slowly eroding the<br />foundation the siblings thought they had. Sydney, Gina and<br />Rick have their individual thin lines.  Sydney is the oldest<br />of the three siblings and her thin line is between enjoying<br />sexual intimacy with her husband and not wanting it. For some<br />reason Sydney always has an excuse and it is beginning to<br />affect her marriage.  Her sister Gina's thin line is really<br />between love and hate, as she struggles with severe domestic<br />problems. She is too ashamed and too afraid to tell her family<br />or seek a solution. And Rick's thin line is between commitment<br />and fear. He and his live in fianc&eacute;e are at odds about marriage,<br />she wants to and he's not ready.<br /><br />When their mother suffers a debilitating stroke the effect<br />reverberates through the family and places their lives in a fish<br />bowl.  Left with the task of providing most of the primary care<br />for her mother, Sydney begins to harbor ill feeling toward her<br />siblings.  Before the resentment can fester, they share some<br />heart wrenching secrets that force them to pull together in a<br />way that strengthens their bond and helps them regain their<br />closeness. They finally put to rest the negatives that<br />threatened to destroy the family.<br /><br />Kimberla Roby has again penned a realistic and heartfelt story<br />about real human problems.  Her books touch your heart in a<br />profound way, and they have you anxiously awaiting the next<br />volume.  It's A Thin Line will make you appreciate family.<br /><br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-09-26
UNFORGETTABLE CHARACTERS	As a novelist, I always appreciate the ability of an author to create in-depth characters. Mary Monroe truly has the gift. Ruby is one character that I will never, ever forget. Ruby is an emotionally disturbed, obese, Christian woman who has more issues than 8 or 9 characters in other novels have put together.<br />She killed her husband, the father of her son Virgil, after he tried to run off with a white woman, she &quot;chatizes&quot; anyone who gets in her way. In other words, she does them in and buries their bodies wherever she can find a vacant spot. While she professes to love the Lord and attends church regularly having grown up as the daughter of a preacher, Ruby manages to convince several people that she is the devil incarnate outside of church hours.<br />After her childhood best friend, Othella, has a stillborn baby, Ruby who served as her midwife, is about to bury the little girl when she starts moving. Ruby has always wanted a daughter and jumps on the opportunity to raise the little girl who she names Maureen.<br />Ruby flees her hometown and finds a home in the Goons, outside Miami, hoping that Othella never discovers that her daughter is still alive. She makes a special place for Maureen upstairs and calls it &quot;The Upper Room.&quot; No one is allowed in the room with the exception of Maureen, Ruby, and Virgil. Ruby believes that if any other man entered the room, he would bring the devil with him and turn Maureen into a whore. Ruby knows about being a whore firsthand because, even though she is extremely unattractive, she was allowed to work in a brothel in a two-for-one deal along with Othella.<br />There is just so much to this novel but I will not give anything more away. You just have to read it for yourself but The Upper Room is a treat of a read and I can't wait to hold serious discussions about it. Mary Monroe is a true storyteller, a rare find, and after reading both The Upper Room and God Don't Like Ugly, she has earned a place among my favorites.<br />Reviewed by Zanemy favorites.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-09-26
LOVE YOURSELF FIRST	Jamerican Connection is filled with much emotion from all characters. Lies from husbands committing infidelity and partners trying to make a relationship work when thousands of miles separate them and only one wants to close those miles. A wife and mother who became both too soon, realizes that she missed a chunk of her childhood and can never get it back.<br />This book is wonderful, some of the acts committed in it were horrific, I read it in one day and so will you. I found it hard to digest the controlling emotionless attitudes the men possessed. Nevertheless it was a page-turner and so real.<br />Whether we were travelling the white beaches of Jamaica or the pavement of Brooklyn, the writers' style was so exceptional you always knew what continent you were resting on.<br />Each character was in search of something within. By the end of the book they each realized that and began another journey. The connection that knitted three women together will be forever engraved in their heart and my mind.<br />I would love to read a sequel of this book.<br />Missy, RAW Reviewer	2001-09-26
Where were the SOUL MATES?	Jada Diamond Tanner has everything going for her.  Her career as a fashion<br />photographer is exploding, she's beautiful and intelligent, and she could<br />have her pick of any man in California.  The problem is she has yet to find<br />that one man...her soul mate.  Enter Wellington Jones, an extremely handsome<br />and successful man who manages to slither his way into Jada's heart the first<br />night that they meet.<br />Jada and Wellington's relationship blooms rapidly and the two find their love<br />connecting on all levels.  When they announce to their families their decision<br />to marry, Jada finds his mother less than enthused, and soon after, Jada and<br />Wellington's relationship is put to the test as sex, lies, deceit, and conception<br />play a climactic role in their love.<br />I have to say I had high expectations for this book.  I LOVED the title, it was a<br />national bestseller and the word-of-mouth for the novel had me anxious to read it.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.  I found myself not liking the majority<br />of the characters, including the two main characters (though I would have LOVED a<br />novel on Jada's mom and her &quot;friend&quot;).  I was under the impression that the reader<br />was to believe that Jada and Wellington truly loved one another, that they were<br />indeed soul mates; however, the only thing I found between the two was sex (which<br />this book has a LOT of), and as a result, I couldn't empathize or sympathize or<br />care much about the pair.<br />I wished for like 50-100 more pages, because the story read too fast and made the<br />situations in the book too unbelievable for me.  But I will say this, I read the<br />book in practically one sitting.  There's something CATCHING about the novel that<br />will make you continue reading it to the very end.<br />I would be interested in reading future works by Morrison to see how her writing<br />style evolves through other projects, but as for SOUL MATES DISSIPATE, I have to<br />rate it a 2.5 on the RAW Scale.I have to <BR>rate it a 2.5 on the RAW Scale.	2001-09-26
A �Peace� of Mind is Worth More Then Life	What happens when your spirit is broken and life has beaten you so bad you want to die?<BR>Solomon Jones, author of Pipe Dream, allowed Black, Leroy, Pookie and Clarisse to answer this question within the 341 pages of his novel. These four characters are crack heads but that's not what this novel is about. This is a story of corruption in the Philadelphia police department, referred to as the city of Brotherly Love.<br />Johnny Podres, city councilman is found in a crack house with a bullet in his head. Leroy together with Pookie another known crack-head, seeks the help of his child-hood friend Black. Once they hook up Black enlists the help of his friend Clarisse. This being a high profile murder, the police need someone to pin this on. The target is Leroy and Black; it doesn't matter that they are innocent and could not have been in two places at the same time.<br />Solomon Jones' suspenseful tale of corruption is so real it's scary. What's scarier than the corruption is that these four characters, as different as they like to believe themselves to be, were the same.  They were all tired of living in hell and wanted to know peace. You will find yourself rooting for them and understanding their path of destruction. This book is not just for those who have walked this path, but it also gives you a look into the lives of several different crack heads.<br />Missy, RAW Reviewer	2001-09-26

Imagine a place where your &quot;mother&quot; is a Christian that murders <BR>anyone that doesn't agree with her ways...and refuses to let you leave <BR>her side, ever?<br />In Mary Monroe's novel, The Upper Room, we are introduced to characters <BR>so scandalous, so malicious, so mysterious, that you can't help but to <BR>continue read this &quot;down south&quot; novel until the very end.<br />Mama Ruby is a woman that hurts first and asks questions later.  Everyone <BR>thinks she's a big, fat, crazy woman, and for the most part, they're right.  <BR>She is known to have powers and strengths that are beyond any man's, and in <BR>her &quot;Christian&quot; way, she uses them for her own needs and desires, and what <BR>she desires more than anything is a daughter.  When her best friend gives <br />birth to a stillborn girl, Mama Ruby takes the small, yet beautiful child to <BR>be buried.  But Mama Ruby's healing hands bring the child back to life, and <BR>realizing that this child is a &quot;sign&quot; of God, she flees the small town of Silo <BR>with her son and her &quot;daughter.&quot;<br />Settling in to a dirt-poor migrant settlement, Mama Ruby raises Maureen as her <BR>own, placing her in the UPPER ROOM of their home, not allowing the child to live <BR>a life that is her own.  Maureen witnesses the evil within Mama Ruby and the evil <BR>that Mama Ruby creates in other people in the small town.  Maureen wants nothing <BR>more but to leave this downtrodding life, and as she gets older, she vows to move <BR>away...but doing that could bring down a wrath upon her unlike anything she's ever <BR>seen.  Will Maureen ever get the life she deserves to have...will secrets be <BR>revealed that could change her life forever?<br />I have to say that first and foremost, Monroe is wonderful at painting a setting <BR>for a story.  By the end of the first page, I was engrossed in the Everglades and <BR>could see it clearly.  This clarity of setting follows throughout the entire novel.  <BR>Each character in the story is vividly descripted, with their own quirks and looks <BR>and practically come off the pages.  The dialect of the characters was thick, but <BR>readable, and it fit in well with the time period and the location of the story.<br />I was a little disappointed, because there didn't seem to be a swell to the story <BR>where the reader would get a climactic ending.  Aside from the many heinous acts <BR>of Mama Ruby and her &quot;clan,&quot; there didn't appear to be a rising of tension in the <BR>novel.  I also had some trouble digesting Mama Ruby's story as to why she was the <BR>way she was, and as such, it was difficult to believe it all.  However, the story <BR>is engaging, and with its fleshed out, off-the-wall characters, you will want to <BR>pick up The Upper Room and read it.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-09-26
The Children Provide the Healing	Blatant bigotry, racism, abortion, adoption, murder, understanding and healing are the ingredients of the novel Misbegotton.  The author, W.

What happens in the aftermath of this crime is the basis of this story.<br />Emily Heiderberg, a college student, is raped one evening while attending a country and western jamboree in Detroit.  Her father, Hugo, a former police officer and known bigot, wants her attackers brought to justice.  The only problem is, he wants to inflict his own type of justice and with the assistance of his associates, he does just that.  Ullyis Washington, the police sergeant, has no tolerance for bigots and he remembers Hugo when he was on the police force.  Following the rape, drama breaks loose in Detroit and the surrounding suburbs and Ullysis is assigned to a task force to assist in solving the crimes.  What is revealed is amazing in and of itself.<br />What becomes of Emily's child?  How does Ullysis behave when his son becomes engaged to someone outside of his race? Those are some of the many questions provided in this story.  The friends and family of the main characters are highlighted and the children provided the healing in this story. The children have a special gift of understanding that forced the adults to stop and look at their behavior and the overall affect.  The results were healing and understanding among four families.  Some of the characters definitely reaped what they sowed.<br />This was an entertaining, drama filled and fast paced story.  The only problem I had with the novel was the editing.  Thought patterns tended to shift to different characters and time periods without indication.  Other than the editing I truly enjoyed this story. Provides for a lively discussion on race relations.<br />Reviewed by Dawn	2001-09-26
SOME SUNDAY IS SOMETHING ELSE	Margaret Johnson-Hodge returns with the sequel to Butterscotch Blues and she does it with immense talent.  Sandy is still mourning the loss of her husband, Adrian, who succumbed to AIDS during their brief marriage.  She is lonely, confused, and in need of someone to ease the pain.  She turns to Winston, Adrian's brother and a close replica....  While some of her friends deem it unethical for her to date her former brother-in-law, others are just happy that she has begun to live again.  But Sandy realizes that Winston is not the one for her when she falls madly in love with Randall, a contractor whom she hires to renovate her basement.<br />While Sandy is going through relationship drama, her friends are equally embroiled in various situations with men.  The thing I enjoyed about this book is that Johnson-Hodge explored the other characters more intensely than she did in Butterscotch Blues so a reader is given insight into all of their lives.  I waited anxiously for this book to come out and it was well worth the wait.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-09-26
Love Is A Crazy Thing	The title, Crazy Thing Called Love, in and of itself is so relevant to the story line that this reader was wondering what was between the pages that had not been told before.<br />This is not the typical love story where boy meets girl, encounters some obstacles and everyone lives happily ever after.  A typical small town where gossip and rumors are common place, you have two individuals who are opposed to falling in love and everything that comes with it, i.e., commitments, emotions.  Two people who are so opposite that their falling in love is out of the norm. You have Judge Jayda Tillman and Attorney Jason McNeal...... Jayda vows never to fall in love again because of her mother's past ramblings, a bad marriage and an even worse divorce.  Jason, the playa, vows to see his younger sisters through college before he can and will make a serious commitment to anyone.  Jayda's character is so cold that her dealings with men are one-dimensional.  Jason's relationship with his mother and sisters is so strong you could not help but cheer him on as he fought to break through Jayda's defenses.  Jayda's proposition to Jason jump-starts this love story.<br />Crazy Thing Called Love is a \\"who done it\\" that appears predictable but the author throws the reader for a loop.  By the time the two protagonists get together and fall in love, you assume the story is over but a wrench is thrown into the mix and the story continues with unexpected results.<br />This story is a concise read with good character development.  This reader understood the characters' behaviors by being privy to their pasts. Gardenias are synonymous with a deep and abiding love!<br />Reviewed by Dawn	2001-09-26
ENGROSSING AND COMPELLING READ!	Just when you think the past is behind you, secrets, lies and deceit have a way of coming back to haunt you.  Jessica, Ellie, Shereen and Yolanda have been tight-knit, close friends since their college pledge days at Howard University.  Eleven years ago, Shereen, Yolanda, Jessica, and Ellie had all met in their sophomore year at Howard at a Theta Phi Kappa rush, an informational gathering for those interested in that particular sorority.   Shereen had always wanted to join a sorority, and having heard about the Theta s dedication to community and their efforts with mentoring inner-city children, Shereen had known this was the sorority for her.  Jessica had become a Theta because her older sister had been one years before her.   Ellie-well, Ellie had heard that the Thetas not only worked hard but partied hard, and she d been hooked.  Yolanda, who had come from the projects, had been personally influenced by the Thetas who d come to her school to mentor underprivileged children.  Many times she said that those sisters had helped instill in her the belief that she could become anything she wanted.  Inspired by their caring nature, Yolanda had vowed to become a Theta herself one day.   <br />It s funny how life can put you in the path of people you otherwise would never have met, giving you a chance to get to know them because you have a similar interest, which allows you to become friends when in other circumstance you would have shared nothing more than a pleasant hi and bye.   That's the way it had been for Shereen, Ellie, Jessica and Yolanda.  They were all so very different Jessica, the shy, private one; Ellie, the party girl who lived for dating and a good time; Yolanda, the strong one who didn t take  from nobody; and Shereen, sexy and sociable, considered by many as some type of goddess.  In spite of these differences, they would be the four (out of 36 pledges) to bond and carry on a friendship beyond the college pledge experience.<BR> <BR>Fast-forward to 11 years later and (almost) each woman is successful in her professional career and seems to have it all.  Jessica is a television personality, Yolanda is a high-powered attorney, Shereen is a highly respected and top notch executive in the family business, and Ellie-well Ellie is still the eternal optimist and looking for Mr. Right.  Things quickly change overnight when one of the ladies begins receiving threatening notes and phone calls.  A secret from the past threatens to erupt and potentially tear all of their futures apart. <br />The Sisters of Theta Phi Kappa is a well-written mainstream novel from Kayla Perrin.  I was immediately engrossed in this suspenseful and intriguing read from page one.  Perrin deftly weaves the past and the present as she tells this engaging and spellbinding story of romance and mystery.  As I read Theta Phi Kappa I experienced a gamut of emotions and I teetered on the edge of my seat as the pieces of the puzzles fell together and the mystery unfolded.   Initially, I was a little hesitant about reading another college sorority story.  However, I liked that Perrin wrote about where the characters were 10 years later rather than focusing  only on the college experience.   Additionally, I also got a chance to stroll down memory lane as I relived some of my sorority escapades.  Sisters of Theta Phi Kappa is an entertaining and engaging read about the depths of friendship, the price of loyalty, and the bonds of sisterhood.  I recommend this intense and emotional page turner to anyone looking for an enjoyable book . And I don t think you will be disappointed with this one. <br />Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-09-26
Journey back to God	As we all know being a young, black man in America is a daily struggle, the life of Malcolm Johnson is no exception. Malcolm is a teenaged boy on the brink of manhood and has a lot going for himself.  He is a good student, a star basketball player, and the only way he has to go is up.<br /><br /> Malcolm is very involved in the church and surrounds himself, with others who are saved as he is. One day Malcolm and his childhood friend Dexter Lewis go to a check cashing store in their neighborhood, and in the blink of an eye Dexter is murdered and dies in Malcolm's arms. This incident has a profound effect on Malcolm and his solid as a rock faith in God is shattered. He cannot understand why God would take away such a good person, and leave the scum of the earth to go on living.<br /> &quot;Eyes Of Faith&quot; a novel by Terrance Johnson takes us along along on Malcolms journey back to God. Along the Malcolm considers changing his religious beliefs, the local press try to ruin his reputation by portraying him as a troublemaker and a thug, due to incidents on and off the basketball court, and Malcolm also has to deal with life in general which is hard for anyone. Faith for Malcolm has become a daily test that he does not know whether he will pass or fail. He is not sure he can believe in God if things continue to go wrong for him.<br /><br /> The premise for &quot;Eyes Of Faith&quot; is a good one, but the way that the story is written is confusing. Throughout the book there are points in the story when I am not sure who the narrator is or who he is referring to. Another problem that I had with the book was  the actual print that the words were in. There were three different fonts, one was so small I almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. This really really hurt the flow of the story because I had to keep going back to read the really, really small print. This book was difficult and slow read for me, on the RAW scale it is a 2.<br />Reviewed by Simone	2001-09-26
This novel is full of PANACHE!	Alexandra Walker is in dire straits.  Her son is seriously ill<br />and in a fit of desperation, she steals jewelry from her employer,<br />Sturbridge's department store.  Her conscience gets the best of<br />her and she quickly places the jewelry back, but her attempted<br />burglary is caught on tape by the mean-spirited and ruthless<br />security guard Spurgeon Brown.  Unfortunately for Alexandra,<br />the tapes only shows her stealing the jewelry, and with the tape,<br />Spurgeon blackmails her into helping him steal a very, rare and<br />sought-after ring from the most prestigious jeweler in town --<br />Panache -- ran by Houston's most eligible bachelor, Chase Thomas.<br />At a charity ball, Alexandra is enraptured by Chase's presence and<br />the two are instantly attracted to each other.  Her heart still<br />bruised from a previous relationship, Alexandra vows to keep her<br />distance with Chase, but just as in all romances, love prevails,<br />and she finds herself falling for him...a definite problem in her<br />eyes, seeing that she has cohorted with Spurgeon and stolen the ring<br />from Chase's company.  Will she ever tell the truth to him...and if<br />he finds out, will he ever truly love and forgive her?<br />This is the premise of PANACHE, the debut novel by author Nathasha<br />Brooks-Harris.  This main plotline is just one of many that are woven<br />through this novel.  There's the health of Alexandra's son, the skeletons<br />that come out in Chase's family's closet, the strained relationship between<br />Alexandra and her mother, amongst others.  I found the concept of the story<br />to be original and fresh, and the novel was definitely a fast read.<br />I was drawn into the lavish, upscale lifestyle of the characters, but I will<br />admit that at times, the characters used language that seemed more<br />&quot;homegirl/homeboy&quot; and that threw me, but I figured, even rich folks can<br />be down, so I tried not to find those instances too glaring.<br />All in all, I found PANACHE to be an intriguing read, full of drama and<br />twists, and a smooth, easy writing style by Brooks-Harris.  Brooks-Harris<br />pulls you into the story with her first sentence, building suspense, and<br />leads the reader to a fast, romantically suspenseful ride.

Mocha-Rific	Black women are strong and beautiful and live with the stress and drama of life everyday. Musings Of A Mocha Sista by Pam Osbey is a compilation of positive stories and poetry that make me proud to be a Black woman. One of my favorite poems is &quot;Sista Love,&quot; this poem details how instead of downing each other. As women we should lift each other and be there for one another.<br /> In the poem &quot;Rejoice&quot; Ms Osbey writes of letting God into your life and letting the glory of His Word rain down upon you. This poem is deeply spiritual and serves as a beacon of light in dark times. This poem is most definitely appropriate now as we as a country try to recover from recent terrorist attacks.<br /> Pam Osbey is a force to be reckoned with in the literary world and I am very much looking forward to reading more of her work. On the RAW scale Musings Of A Mocha Sista is a 4.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-09-26

Carl Weber Blows UP in Sophomore Novel!	Carl Weber's sophomoric treat, &quot;Married Men' is a novel full of drama that <BR>surrounds four men bound by friendship and the loves in their lives.<br />One of my favorite reads of 2001, Weber introduces us to:<br />Kyle, a successful brother who finds himself dealing with racial discrimination <BR>that has him rethinking his life with a wife who can never truly identify with <BR>his color issues;<br />Allen, the easy-going brother of the bunch, which would explain why he's having <BR>such a hard time pleasing both his bossy mother and his trifling, gold-digging <BR>girlfriend;<br />Wil, the more &quot;together&quot; of the pack, who has a good job, a wonderful, albeit <BR>gossipy wife and kids, but one mistaken indiscretion may cost him everything he <BR>holds dearly; and <br />Jay, the devout married playa who can't seem to grow up and get his act together, <BR>until it's too late.<br />I'm almost afraid of what Weber will bring to us next.  His debut novel, &quot;Lookin' <BR>for Luv&quot; was a smash hit and brought him a legion of fans, and &quot;Married Men&quot; far <BR>surpasses that novel in my opinion.  Weber is definitely fine tuning an already <BR>wonderful talent.  You can't help but to pick up this book and dive in head first <BR>to the drama that wreaks havoc with the brothers.  It was so refreshing to see black <BR>men who had good careers, who under it all were good people, despite the mistakes and <BR>pit falls that tried to trip them up.<br />This is a novel I would definitely recommend others to read, and I'm anxiously awaiting <BR>&quot;Baby Mama Drama.&quot;  The title just kind of says it all, doesn't it?<br />Reviewed by Shonie Bacon	2001-09-17
Hilarious Trials &amp; Tribulations of Being BROKE!	I have to say, if this was a fiction novel, THE BROKE DIARIES would have rated a 5, HANDS DOWN! But as a non-fiction memoir novel...and having been a broke college student, I found the book more comical than realistic, and I rated it a 4.<br />Angela Nissel lays all her broken days as a college student out for the public to read, and what she has accomplished is a book that is hilariously outrageous and a laugh fest, from beginning to end, but on top of that, you feel Angela's strain of BEING broke and smiling through her &quot;fasting&quot; days.<br />The situations that Nissel gets herself into to find something to eat...to get books for her classes are truly funny, and students everywhere will relate to at some point being down and out.<br />Aside from the comedic value of BROKE, I found myself thinking about the educational institution and just HOW they could make you pay an arm and a leg to go to an ivy league school, yet HARDLY pay or assist you to be able to do what you came to do...learn!<br />I think I will find myself flipping through BROKE again, because it's one of those books where you can flip to an entry, relive an experience with Angela and roll in laughter.<br />I would definitely recommend BROKE...especially to my fellow broke college students!<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-09-17
Intriguing and Cleverly Crafted Page Turner!	Chicago Tribune, Friday, June 9, 2000<br />Kitchen Works Vice-President Found Slain In Office<br />Douglas Dardis, 52, Vice-President Sales for Kitchen Works, was found slain in office.  Dardis suffered severe head trauma from repeated blows by a blunt instrument.  No weapon has been found.  Dardis had been with Kitchen Works for five months and was known to rule with an iron hand and a neo-nazi style.  Due to his micromanagement style he wasn't known to have any allies at Kitchen Works.  Employees remembered him as an individual who thought himself to be their savior.  Dardis had informed employees that, &quot;It has been apparent that in the past, you experienced a lack of strong leadership.  People did their own thing at their own pace, and quality control was low priority.  Many of you have poor work habits nurtured by your prior environment.  This can be repaired. A number of employees are resisting the tides of change.  I will not name names, but I will set forth this response.  You will not win.  I am raising the bar for your division and if you cannot accept it, there are thousands of other employment opportunities in Chicago.&quot;  Given these harsh words, there is no wonder that none of the employees shared any love lost for Dardis and that in fact some of them might have wanted him dead.  Thus far, no one has been eliminated from the investigation, however, the leading suspects are:<br />Lydia Gray--Dardis' very pregnant secretary.  Gray was afraid of miscarrying because of the duress that she was working under.  Dardis didn t like for Gray to leave her desk to go to lunch or to the bathroom.  Dardis made her reschedule a critical doctor s appointment, remove her personal items from her cubicle and take a sandwich back because it didn't include mayo even tho the woman was eight months pregnant and shouldn't have been running personal errands for him.<br />Wally Cleveland Manager of Sales.  Wally had suffered a prior heart attack and was instructed to take nitroglycerin only as needed.  When Dardis came on board Cleveland went to a pill a day and told employees that he was thinking about retiring rather than enduring the heavy hand of Dardis.<br />Bill Sutton Senior Sales Representative.  Bill was upset and lost his temper after he learned that he wouldn't move up as the next Manager of Sales if Cleveland retired.  Bill felt that the position belonged to him because he was promised the position by Cleveland.  Bill s uproar cost him his job and he was subsequently fired.<br />Seth Frigo Senior Sales Representative.  Seth was known to be a brown-noser, however, he worked out his anxiety via writing.  Could he possibly be the one who sent  the threatening notes to Dardis?<br />Mack Ruge Sales Representative.  Ruge had a prior arrest for assaulting his boss at a former company.<br />Dolores Fowler Customer Support Supervisor.  Fowler made the mistake of sharing with Dardis that she was a former Playboy Centerfold Miss August 1985 aka Vivian Vixen.  After this revelation, Fowler started receiving harassing notes and phone calls which she perceived were coming from Dardis.  Fowler is known to have connections with the Mob.  Could she have hired someone to kill Dardis?<br />Helen McCarthy Catalogue Coordinator.  McCarthy was an overzealous Christian who kept in contact with her deaf and elderly mother via faxes and emails.  Dardis initially approved McCarthy s use of the facsimile and computer to send her mother messages but later he complained about it.  Additionally, McCarthy was insulted when Dardis swiftly looked at her catalogue layout and told her that she needed to start over.  A fellow employee commented that McCarthy had a mean streak under that church girl look.<br />Killing the Boss is a creatively crafted and ingeniously written mystery with a killing of the boss just waiting to happen.  The author provides a suspenseful read along with a satirical view of the business world. The story is realistically told like an actual police investigation through a blend of police clues, emails, news reports and suspect interviews.

Easy To Read, Hard to Fathom!	&quot;I wanted to commit suicide.&quot;<br />&quot;I had suffered four long, torturous years of my father's intimate abuse, but<br />it was all going to end tonight, Sunday, May 16th.  I hadn't planned it that<br />way, but that's what was to happen.  All the stuff would hit the fan.&quot;<br />Up until the time she was 12, Tasha's family appeared to be your typical,<br />blue-collar, loving middle class family with a stay-at-home mom, hardworking<br />father and playful siblings.  Tasha thought she had the best mom on the<br />block, afterall, her mom was young enough to entertain Tasha and her older<br />sister, Tina and younger brother, Tyrone ...but she was also old enough not to<br />be thought of as a young slut with a houseful of kids.  She was a housewife<br />and took good care of her children.  Tasha wouldn't have traded her mom for<br />anything in the world.  At least not at nine anyway..but when Tasha turned<br />twelve it was a whole 'nother story.  Tasha's mom, Gina, seemed to go through<br />emotional changes after the birth of her fourth child, and Tasha's dad,<br />Tommy, started to view Tasha as his sex kitten.  All of the kids would feel<br />the affect of the parental changes but Tasha would be most impacted as she<br />would be verbally, physically and sexually abused and too frightened to tell<br />anyone what was going on in her household.<br />Kimberly Matthews writes Tasha's story with deep compassion and clarity. When<br />we're initially introduced to Tasha she's just enjoying being a child,<br />unfortunately Tasha's childhood is stolen too quickly by adults who should<br />know better.  Promise You Won't Tell Nobody drives home the sad realization<br />of the depth of abuse and the mentality that comes along with it.  The<br />subject matter was so poignant and riveting that often I had to set the book<br />aside and regroup before I could read another page.  As I read this<br />heart-wrenching and emotionally disturbing saga, I kept wondering what<br />happened to this family...I wanted to know what made the mom snap...was it<br />post-partum depression after the birth of the fourth child?  And I wanted to<br />know why did the father choose to molest Tasha and not Tina...or why not<br />both...either way it was wrong but I wanted to better understand his motives.<br />I was angered by the mother's actions and kept wishing that this were a<br />fictional read but unfortunately I wouldn't receive that comfort because I<br />knew it was not.<br />First-time author, Kimberly T. Matthews, treads in emotionally rich and<br />disturbing territory in the autobiography titled Promise You Won't Tell<br />Nobody.

�A Picture Has A Thousand Words�	The Lives Of Slave Children is a story about how children lived during slavery.  This book is the true-life stories of former slaves and their descriptions of life as a child as told by the ex-slaves themselves.  Book 5 is the fifth in the series of the I Was A Slave books and is edited by Donna Wyant Howell.<br />Beginning with the introduction when Howell was nine years old she became very interested in a story told to her by her great-grand mother, Cora Wyant.  The story was about a wonderful day in Cora Wyants life when she was nine.  Cora and her mother walked off the plantation free persons.<br />During the 1930's interviewers working for the Work Projects Administration transcribed thousands of pages of dialogue that are housed throughout the United States in archive repositories.  This information is contained on pages 5 and 6 and must be read before reading the book.<br />Pages 7 and 8 contain a list of terms and their meaning which are used throughout the book such as \\"dinner = lunch.\\"  Pages 9 and 10 are a Dialect Glossary that contains only the words most frequently used in the book such as \\"cotch = catch, caught.\\"  This book does deliver.  The terminology list and dialect glossary are the pathways for understanding the type of language used in the book.  The reader is able to understand what the former slaves are trying to say.<br />The average age of the former slaves was seventy to over on hundred years old at the time of the interview.  There are numerous differences of opinions about the life of a slave child.  Each former slave's story is related to his or her own unique interpretation of their life as a slave child on the plantation where they lived.<br />This book is very soul stirring and unique.  Some of the excerpts display the actual photographs in black and white of slave children.  The adult black and white photographs were taken at the time of the interviews.  One black and white photograph that stands out is on page 17.  There are ten slave children whose names are unknown.  These children are sitting on a plank porch and one older child is holding a baby in her arms.  The children look so somber.  Their hair is short and thick.  Each of the children is dressed in long shirts and is barefooted.  This photograph made me cry.  The photograph tells you something about their feelings but you cannot identify who is male or female.  During slavery time children wore this type of clothing on most plantations.<br />Howell has done an excellent job of compiling and editing this book.  Basically no extensive editing was done.  She compiled the words and dialect just as the interviewers had written them with only minor changes.  The distinctions she made were the information in enclosed brackets, which gave life to the meaning of the dialect words.  The interviewers' comments are in parenthesis.<br />Reading this book has been a rewarding experience for me.  I could not put the book down till I finished.  As African Americans this book is a part of our history.  At last we are introduced to actual true-life stories about slave children and their description of their lives.

After an accidental pregnancy during her senior <BR>year of high school, her plans changed and she found herself as a single parent trying to take care of her infant daughter. Thus began her days of working hard for a living.  Relationships would come and go and she would even venture to get married. Now three years later she's pretending that her marriage didn't happen even though she's still legally married to her deadbeat husband.  One bad relationship too many, Sara vows to put relationships on hold and busies herself  with taking care of business you know: the rent, gas, electric, phone, grocery, laundry, transportation, daughter s Catholic school tuition (as Sara says &quot;even though she made stupid choices she wasn't educationally stupid&quot; so as long as she worked her daughter was going to the best school possible) and Sara struggles to take care of all of these needs on a meager secretary's salary. Still in her 20s, Sara has a narrow view of life and very few dreams.  Based upon Sara's experiences thus far she sums up her life as being  &quot;Cursed to work.  She has a job and not a career.  Careers are for those who have graduated college.  The rest of us have a job.  And all of this because I happened to be born on a Saturday.&quot; <br />Sara's best friend, Brenda, decides that even a Saturday Child needs a little frolic and love in her life and introduces Sara to not one, but two men.   Ever nagging in the back of Sara's mind is that she's had one too many doomed relationships. As such, Sara stopped looking for Mr. Do-Right-Man and doesn't expect much from Franklin or Theo.  But as she lets her guard down she realizes that one man only wants the best for her, including spending the rest of his life with her, and the other decides to own her and will stop at nothing to have her in his life. Sara wonders how did she get tangled in this <BR>web and how will she survive when a vicious tragedy strikes. <br />Saturday s Child by first-time novelist, Gayle Sloan, is an entertaining yet suspenseful and intriguing story.  Sloan hooks the reader from Chapter One and takes you on a roller coaster ride as we experience Sara's antics and escapades.  Along the way we will laugh out loud, scream, holler, and cry as we journey through Sara's saga; in the end we will be deeply satisfied with this spellbinding read. Saturday's Child was a compelling and engrossing read which I read in one sitting and didn't want to end.  Sloan is a talented writer and I look forward to future novels from this up-and-coming author. <br />Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-09-17
Beautifully Poignant!	In this beautiful sequel to Butterscotch Blues, Hodge's Some Sunday continues <BR>the story of Sandy Hutchinson, who after losing her soul mate Adrian to AIDS, <BR>decides that she doesn't want or need love and basically becomes a recluse, much <BR>to the chagrin of her best friends, Martha, Britney, and Janice.<br />Sandy's well-hidden desire begins to emerge when she spends time with Winston, <BR>Adrian's brother, who bares an eerie resemblance to Adrian.  Sandy and Winston's <BR>easy, &quot;friendship&quot; love becomes unstable when Sandy hires Randall, a contractor, <BR>to repair her basement...and in the process, he attempts to repair her heart.<br />This novel is so wonderfully written that I clung to the book, reading it in one <BR>sitting.  The friendships between Sandy, and her sisterfriends were so real, painful <BR>yet real, and the storyline was full of angst, drama, love, laughter, and that <BR>underlying theme that life goes on, and we all deserve love.<br />Hodge should be applauded for writing such a touching story that celebrates life and <BR>showcases slightly older, mature people as they go through the adversities of life.<br />Reviewed by Shonie Bacon	2001-09-17
Oral Black History	I have always wondered how slaves felt about the quality of their lives. I have read many books on the institution of slavery but never have I had the opportunity to read their actual true-life stories. I Was A Slave is a book about the true-life stories of former slaves and their descriptions of plantation life as told by the ex-slaves themselves. Book 1 is the first in the series of the I Was A Slave books and is edited by Donna Wyant.<br />Beginning with the introduction Howell shares her personal account of her great grandmother, Cora Wyants' story about the day she walked off of the plantation a free person.<br />The excerpts and full interviews were dictated by the former slaves and transcribed by interviewers working for the Work Projects Administration during the 1930's. Thousand of pages of these dialogues are housed in the archival repositories throughout the United States.<br />This book does deliver. Pages 5 and 6 give a detailed account of the attitudes of the interviewers and what affect it had on the response of the former slaves. The information contained on pages 5 and 6 is very important and must be read before reading the book. Pages 7 and 8 contain a list of terms and their meaning which are used throughout the book such as \\"suit = a set or outfit of clothing; not a suit as the word is used currently.\\" Pages 9 and 10 is a Dialect Glossary that contains only the words most frequently used in the book such as \\"weuns, we'uns= we, us, our.\\" The terminology list and dialect glossary are the pathways for understanding the type of language used in the book. The reader is able to understand what the former slaves are trying say.<br />The average age of the former slaves was seventy to over one hundred years old at the time of the interview. On page 11 the true-life stories unfold. There are numerous differences of opinions about the description of plantation life. Each former slave's story is related to his or her own unique interpretation of their lives on the plantations where they lived.<br />This book is very poignant and soul stirring. The pictures displayed in the book give you a more in depth understanding about the living conditions of the former slaves. The pictures are in black and white and so real. Some of the excerpts display the actual picture of the former slave at the time of the interview. You can see the sadness and pain on their weathered faces. There are no real smiling faces. These people knew how to endure.<br />Howell has done an excellent job of compiling and editing this book. Basically no Extensive editing was done. She compiled the words and dialect just as the interviewers had written them with only minor changes. The distinctions she made were the information in enclosed brackets, which gave life to the meaning of the dialect words. The interviewers' comments are in parenthesis.<br />Reading this book has been a rewarding experience for me. I could not put the book down till I finished. When you turn the pages there is a feeling of intense sadness. As African Americans this book is a part of our history. At last we are introduced to actual true-life stories about slavery. All African Americans young and old need to read this book.<br />Dorothy Cooperwood, RAW Reviewern the plantations where they lived.<BR>This book is very poignant and soul stirring.

MY SPIRIT IS AWAKENED	Inspirational and Finding My Own Shine are not words I<br />associate with poetry. I thought poetry was rhymes<br />like, Roses are red, violet are blue, sugar is sweet<br />and so are you. I am truly grateful that the author<br />has given me another view of poetry.The poetry in<br />Shine encourages you to look inward.<br />Shine is a divine influence. After reading these 48<br />pages it is my ambition to be 100% of me. A favorite<br />of mine is titled I Will Tell Myself, I plan to read<br />this poem whenever others try to define who I am. The<br />fourth paragraph of I Will Tell Myself read: &quot;I am not<br />confused - I am convinced that I have greatness within<br />and I am Superwoman able to leap TALL DECEPTION in a<br />single bound\\", wow is all I can say to that.<br />This author doesn't stop there, she has included the<br />spoken word as well. This CD is one you do not want to<br />be without, complementing her poetry is Neosoul and<br />funk. This blend of music fits perfectly with her<br />words. Angry Don't Live Here No More is \\"Da Bomb\\"I<br />would love to ride to Philly and be a part of the<br />audience where she \\"melts the mic\\" with her poetry.<br />Evans' multimedia book is for the whole family.

What a Literary Mind!	I had absolutely no idea what to expect when I first picked up this novel. By the time I got to the second chapter, I realized that it was a rare find; a diamond in the ruff. Zon, trying to escape the teasing of his college buddies who discover that he is a virgin, decides to join the Peace Corps and volunteer in Africa as a missionary for a year. On his way to his designation, his plane is hijacked by a couple of mercenaries heavily involved in arms trading. Everyone on board is killed except for Zon, who is shot and plummets from the plane. Lying mangled among the trees, he is bitten by a venomous snake and loses consciousness.<br />Three women find him and two of them help him back to their village in Benin while the third sets off to find herself. Zon is left alone for more than a year by the villagers who only give him food scraps. His only friends become the birds that continuously soar over his head. Miraculously, Zon manages to climb a hill and reach the village on the other side. However, that is not the only miracle because Zon has discovered his &quot;bolo.&quot; Zon can control things with his mind and has developed a physique more commanding than the one he possessed before he was harmed.<br />Idrisi, a villager, teaches Zon how to control his &quot;bolo&quot; and Zon remains there for a while longer before heading back to the states. He returns home on a mission to right wrongs and does just that. He prevents a man, accused of raping a white woman who was really his mistress, from being lynched. He retaliates against an evil military officer that orders the mass murder of 4,000 Haitians on a flotilla. These are just a couple of the imaginative scenarios that occur in the novel.<br />In addition, Zon meets the beatuiful Xia, a psychiatrist. He can not allow himself to become emotionally involved because he fills that his mission to save mankind is more important. Despite his determination to do the opposite, Zon does fall in love with Xia and is tormented by his decision to remain celibate.<br />All I can say it what an imagination. I take that back. I can also say what a literary mind because this books is just that: literary. I look forward to reading other works by Mr. Morris and I highly recommend this one.<br />Reviewed by Zaneted by his decision to remain celibate. <br />All I can say it what an imagination.

Complex, Compelling and Engrossing!	Sympathy for the Devil (SFTD) is a thrilling and intriguing mystery debut novel from Christopher Chambers.  Chambers introduces us to Angela Bivens, the sharp, intelligent FBI Special Agent of this exciting new thriller.<br />Two inner city teenage girls are killed on the mean streets of the nation's capitol.  The police and politicians want to wrap up the case quickly without even investigating because they believe that it's just another case of black-on-black crime and a routine causality of a drug war among poor folks that no one will really miss.  Agent Bivens has just  won a class action discrimination suit against the FBI, to appease Agent Bivens, and to satisfy the requirement for field work, her superiors throw her a bone...help the DC police solve this case which really holds little interest for most Agents on the fast-track.  Agent Bivens has a mission -after witnessing a tragic incident  as a young girl- she swore that she would always be there to help the underdog. She tackles this case and gives it her all as she suspects there's more to the killings than just routine drug war mishaps.  As Agent Bivens digs deeper, and the case begins to unravel, the evidence leads to her personal life.  It seems that boyfriend, Trey Williams, a successful DC attorney has an identical twin brother called Pluto who might be a suspect.  Pluto has a prior criminal record, is a heroin addict and dabbles in myth and the occult. Could he be the mastermind behind the serial killings?<br />SFTD is a page-turner that will have youon the edge of your seat as you speed read to solve this legal thriller.  It's a compelling read that will hold your attention until the very last page...although I must admit that I couldn't read fast enough and was often tempted to skip to the end to find out the outcome.  I look forward to more Special Agent Angela Bivens storylines and mystery lovers of Legal Thrillers will enjoy this impressive debut novel from Christopher Chambers.<br />Reviewed by Yasminy Yasmin	2001-09-17
Bravery At The Beach	I have been a resident of North Carolina for over 12 years and had never heard of Richard Etheridge and the Pea Island Life Savers. The book Fire On The Beach by authors David Wright and David Zoby is a very important history lesson not just for those of us living in North Carolina but also for people living all over the world.<br /> Richard Etheridge began life as a slave in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, he was property of the Etheridge family and was considered a part of the family. At the age of 21 Richard, without asking the permission of his owners, joined the army and became a Union soldier. Richard was proud to be fighting to try to end slavery. He was prepared to fight to the death to make life better for himself and those around him. While in the Army, Etheridge and other Black soldiers were known as the &quot;African Brigade.&quot; These men fought valiently and after the war they all went back home to some of the same problems and issues they had before the war.<br /> The Outer Banks of North Carolina had always been a problem for ships;they often ran aground on the North Carolina shores. As a result, in 1874, life saving stations were opened all over the Outer Banks. Initially most of the crews were checkered or made up of Black and White men. The Lifesavers of the Outer Banks had a troubled history of haphazardly run patrols, poorly trained lifesavers, and stations that were run erracticly. Many lifesavers got positions because of who they knew and were related to. The Lifesavers of the Outer Banks were in desparate need of an image change.<br /> In February 1880, that image changed radically, Richard Etheridge was named keeper of Pea Island Station 17, and what made it even more special is that he had an all Black crew. A Keeper is a man who could keep stroke with an oar, knew the local currents and had a disposition that allowed for high risks at low pay. This appointment was historic and even as racially divided as the United States was at that time, everyone agreed that Richard Etheridge was more than qualified for the position.<br /> Being a member of the Life Saving Service was not an easy task, add to that being Black and that makes for a lot of drama. This book is very informative and important for people of all races and all over the world. The dates,the facts,and the many stories told are put together well. On the RAW scale it is a 4.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

A Wonderful Experience	This book had me laughing out loud because of the frankness expressed in these poems and essays. It is very refreshing to see written many things I have thought about: romance, politics and the Hip-Hop community. Ms. Jamal and her collection of \\"in yo face\\" words make you stand up and take notice.<br />Ms. Jamal touches on your fears, accomplishments and fantasies. On page 10, she introduces Ghetto Poem, my interpretation of this poem is about how close we all are to being homeless. Looking at someone else's backyard could easily be my own one day. As scary as some of Jamal's work is, it is our reality, and the world we live in. I challenge you to take the plunge and delve into Passion, Pride, and Politickin.

IF YOU ARE A SINGLE MOTHER, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK	Carla J. Curtis keeps it simple and real in A Single Woman's Parenting Journey: Survival Tidbits. She breaks down all the joy and aggravation involved in raising children in today's corrupted society alone. She does this through motivational concepts, religious thought, and prayer. While merely a hundred pages, it contains a treasury of information and is extremely reader friendly. Easily readable in the space of an afternoon, any single mother that passes on it is truly losing out.<br />It is refreshing to know that I am not alone in my single parenting journey. Then again, I already knew it because I see single mothers all the time and know a ton of them. But it is not often, if ever, that we actually take the time out to sit down and discuss the trials of raising our children alone. That is what this books does. It opens up the discussion gates to do just that. What a wonderful concept.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-09-17
Look Inside Yourself	Nia Yolanda Chavez is your typical teenager living in New York.<br />She is beautiful, likes talking about boys, and she is a cheer<br />leader.

They often<br />take Nia in, when she has no where else to go. Even with the<br />Thompson's constant love and support, Nia is physically and<br />sexually abused by the men that her mother allow into their<br />home.

In San Diego<br />she meets life-long friends and faces horror and pain. In<br />reading this book I found myself wanting to reach out and<br />protect Nia from the pain.

Intriguing Premise, Great Writing	Mia and Edward Simone are happily married. Mia has managed to live out her dream of becoming a successful author and her book, A State of Mind, has catapulted her to the top of her game. She loves the attention given to her by fans and while a little bit concerned about the same man showing up at various booksignings throughout the country, she mentions it to her best friend in passing and then dismisses it. That is, until the unthinkable happens.<br />Parker is an extremely sick man, having been abused as a child, diagnosed as mentally unstable, and prescribed medication to help him deal with his loose grip on reality. However, the medicine is not working and Parker decides to kidnap Mia, his favorite author, so that he can act out scenes from her book with her. After he abducts Mia, he calls her by the name of Val, the main character from her book, and tortures her with cigarettes whenever she disobeys him or speaks to him in a degrading fashion.<br />While Mia is struggling to regain her freedom, Edward is being comforted by Lynda, Mia's best friend. After less than a week of disappearance, Edward practically succumbs to Lynda's seduction, which leads the reader to ponder the credibility of his love for his wife.<br />Once Mia's ordeal ends in tragedy, she is reunited with her husband and things get back to normal.<br />Anna Dennis has a wonderful writing style. I would have liked for the kidnapping sequence to last longer since I felt that was the main premise of the book. However, the steamy bedroom scenes and obvious gift for dialogue and storytelling make up for it. It is a quick read, 183 pages in mass market, and worth devoting a weekend afternoon flipping the pages.<br />I give this book a 4 on the RAW Scale.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-09-17
DREAMS ARE OUR FUTURE, DON�T LET YOURS DIE	I chose to read Born in Sin, because of the title. I like drama and assumed the pages would be overflowing with it.

EXCELLENT Thriller With A STRONG Female Lead!	A high-octane thriller is one of the best ways to describe Christopher Chambers' debut novel, Sympathy for The Devil.<br />As SYMPATHY opens, we are introduced to FBI Special Agent Angela Bivens, who has just won a sex and race discrimination lawsuit against the FBI. She's anxious and weary to see what type of job the Bureau will hand her after the dust has settled, and when she receives a case that will allow her to be the field agent she's always wanted to be, Angela is happy, but quickly the joy of her new job is erased. Angela's case involves the recent deaths of two black teenage girls and a rash of macabre murders that involve rival gangs. Everyone in the Bureau is quick to blame the deaths on gangs, but Angela has her suspicions.<br /> Though her job keeps her stressed, when Angela meets P. T. &quot;Trey&quot; Williams, an attorney from a well-to-do family, full of connections and looks, Angela tries to find the balance between her hectic job and her blooming love life. Little does Angela know that her love life will interplay with the case she's working on in such horrific ways not even imaginable. Will Angela be able to solve the complexity of the crimes at hand...without being condemned by her FBI bosses, WHILE getting to keep her relationship?<br />I LOVED this novel, point blank. I enjoyed reading a novel with a strong female lead who used her inner strength to do what she had to do. Chambers' characters are wonderfully drawn out, with crisp dialogue and fast-paced action and suspense. There were a few times where the FBI titles and terminology were kind of heavy, but the excellent writing eradicated those problems. There was a multi-layered complexity to this novel, that may be daunting to some, but once again, the storyline is so tight and intriguing, I think readers will be able to overcome that and realize just how great this novel is.<br /> I would DEFINITELY recommend SYMPATHY to all readers, black, white, or other...and will be on the lookout fornew work by Chambers.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-09-12

Love Thy Brother	How can two brothers who come from the same tragic background turn out so differently? In author E.D. Johnson's The Mark of Cain this is exactly what happens. Marshall Garnett is an R&amp;B superstar who has everything going for him: a beautiful young wife, a solid singing career, money, and and a penchant for excess. Marshall is so caught up in himself that he does not see things happening right in front of his face.<br /> One thing is for sure with Marshall, he will not go back to being the poor boy from Newark, NJ that he began life as. Michael Garnett, who is also known as Malik, has decided that he is going to change the world and make it a better place for Black people. He so believes in his cause to rid the world of all bad white people, that he joins an underground group called the Cell. Malik has decided to sacrifice everything in favor of the cause. Malik and Marshall have been out of touch for years. But even though Marshall wasn't exactly sure of where his brother was he always managed to support him finacially and Malik has followed Marshall's singing career.<br /> The Mark of Cain is a story that has a little bit of everything going on: death, drugs, and destruction. Some parts of the story dragged and a lot of the questions were left unanswered. This story has a lot of potential, but it just seems to fizzle out at the end.

Caution�Or You Might be Headed For Disaster	First-time novelist, Nathan K. Stephens gives us an entertaining and poignant novel titled A Different Breed of Brother. When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it. I thought it was just another predictable relationship novel with more boy meets girl drama. In fact, I was very turned off by the first half of the book and didn't like any of the characters. The characters were very one-dimensional and basically identical in physical description as well as attitudes and behaviors so it was difficult for me to distinguish one from the other.<br /> Joe, Taj, CK and Marcus were four college-educated brothers who lived for the moment very precariously, gave no thought to condoms or safe sex, but were always on the prowl for women...any woman...especially easy women. Their exploits became so monotonous that I wondered if people still behaved this way in this age of AIDS and other STDs (unfortunately there are adults who act like these folks). By the time I got to the middle of the book, I had classified this book as humor/satire because the content was just too comical. Especially since, Joe, who was about to get married had challenged the fellows to a final weekend of promiscuity that was just too hilarious to be true. In fact, it was so hilarious, that it would end up being the turning point for all of the fellows and for me.<br /> Each of the guys would experience a life altering experience that would leave one grieving heavily, one questioning his sexuality, another contemplating the meaning of life and yet another wondering if his loved one would ever know him. As I reflect back on the story, I realized that I laughed, cried, felt anger, rejoiced and was inspired.<br /> If you can stick with this book until the second half of the storyline it will not disappoint as it is far from predictable with surprising plot twists and turns. Wow...talk about a sobering experience along with a deep and poignant message, the last half of this book wasdefinitely that. There were a lot of lessons packed in the last half of the book which need to be heeded by all who're in the dating game. A Different Breed of Brother should be a necessary read for all the players out there and for the young women who are attracted to these types of men. It was such a shame that some terrible things had to happen before these brothers saw the light but it also showed that you can't go through life being a player without there being some serious consequences.<br /> If you're seeking an entertaining read with a serious message then check out this book. If you know folks like the ones above then purchase this book for them. They need to read it to find out what can happen when you're careless and self-centered.<br /> Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-08-28

How Long is Forever?	Timmothy McCann picks up where he left off with Until, his debut novel, as he re-visits the relationship and marriage between Betty and Drew in his third novel, Forever. It seems as if both parties rushed into the marriage because for one they weren't sure the other would stay committed to the decision and secondly because they felt it was the right thing to do. Was it? And how long will forever last?<br /> Drew is spending the majority of his time with his ailing mother and doesn't feel as if Betty fully supports his dedication to his mother, neither is he positive that she really loves him and wants to continue their marriage. Betty is caught up in one of the biggest trials of her career and turns off advances from her ex-boyfriend Lavendar...yet, is she sure she's really over him? And, was her marriage to Drew the right thing to do? Does she really want to be married to him?<br /> Thrown into the mix are their best friends Jacqui and Stefan who are going through their own issues of maintaining a relationship and deciding if they really want to commit themselves to each other...forever. Is marriage right for them?<br /> In both couples, as in a lot of relationships, we see a lack of communication and the desire to understand the other person's feelings. Because of this, both couples are faced with deciding what the next step would be along with how long forever would really last.<br /> Though not a main character, the character of Blue stood out more to me in this book even more so than Betty and Drew. Blue was there to serve as the voice of wisdom and guidance that can be paralleled to the lessons taught by our parents, by the lessons of the Bible, and also the actual marriage vows one utters at their wedding ceremony.<br /> McCann has written a wonderful novel that mimics the issues found in relationships and marriages and I highly recommend this book and look forward to his next release.<br /> Reviewed by Tee C.

Each character is so fresh and different, you can't help but to see and hear each character's personality shine through on the pages. The dialogue, told in more of a script format, is interesting and flows very nicely, and there is so much drama and conflict in EPISODES you can't help but to read in a rush to get to the ending.

Hilarious Trials &amp; Tribulations of Being BROKE!	I have to say, if this was a fiction novel, THE BROKE DIARIES would have rated a 5, HANDS DOWN!

Aside from the comedic value of BROKE, I found myself thinking about the educational institution and just HOW they could make you pay an arm and a leg to go to an ivy league school, yet HARDLY pay or assist you to be able to do what you came to do...learn!<br />I think I will find myself flipping through BROKE again, because it's one of those books where you can flip to an entry, relive an experience with Angela and roll in laughter.

Asking his wonderful girlfriend to marry him will be icing on his already sweet cake, but before he's able to propose, he suffers the tragic loss of his father, a man who has taught him everything in how to become a good man. His father's dying words are, &quot;Have brother...help him,&quot; and though James isn't sure what he means by this, soon enough, his life will take an adventurous turn that will unravel secrets pertaining to his family life.<br /> James is adopted, this he knows, but among the many surprises, twists and turns you will find in this novel, James learns that he has a half-brother who is on death row for the rape and murder of an elected official's daughter. James becomes deeply immersed in helping his brother stay alive, while trying to deal with the secrets and his father's death.<br /> I have to say, I truly enjoyed this novel. Pridgen vividly portrays the pain of losing a loved one, and I could feel the pain the characters were going through in this gripping story. The choices that the main character had to make felt real, and you couldn't help but to attach yourself to him and go along with him on his journey to finding the truth about his brother's case. I loved Pridgen's writing style and the characters that surrounded James in the novel...they all had their own distinct voice.<br /> As I finished this book..with its bittersweet, yet promising ending, I wondered..or maybe HOPED that the author might revisit these characters in future stories. I could definitely see a mystery/suspense series with James...and his best bud, Chuck.

Does this one measure up? (3.5 Stars)	When I chose to read THE MEASURE OF A MAN: A SPIRITUAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Sidney Poitier this year, it had nothing to do with the fact that he is an American icon who is recognized and respected by many throughout the world. If truth were told, I've only seen 4 of his 40+ films, which clearly establishes the fact that I am no Sidney Poitier movie buff. I simply chose to add this book to my reading list this year because I was drawn to its title.<br /> For me, the title meant that this charismatic and successful man would look back over his long complex life to share some insights to the kind of scale he used to measure and/or weigh the true meaning of his life. Just as a scale is arranged in graded series, so are the significant events in Poitier's life. Even though this book does not tell his life in chronological order, it does present events in his life as themes, which were shaped by the times and circumstances that surrounded him.<br /> Clearly at the base of his scale are the strong core values/morals he learned from his parents while growing up on the tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas. It will be those core values that sustain him upon his arrival in America at age 15 in 1943 and throughout his life as a husband, father and ultimately, an actor. As Poitier begins to carve out a successful acting career during the '50s &amp; '60s, he is mindful that his personal and public life must be reflective of the kind of legacy that the Poitier elders left behind. Therefore, he did not let the backlash he received from some in the black community during the '60's for making films that depicted &quot;exemplary human beings&quot; deter him. Instead of being angry and confrontational about the social injustices of the times, he chose to channel those emotions into something positive. That positive energy is what kept him seeking and demanding quality roles as a black actor.<br /> Sidney Poitier is an excellent storyteller and this book as some say is, &quot;anecdotally rich.&quot; Even though I enjoyed much of what he talks about, I felt that some of his writings rambled on, and at times were out of place with regards to the book's chapter. So continuity of content was definitely not a strong issue during the editing stages of this book. The fact that he refers to this as, &quot;a spiritual autobiography&quot; is a bit ambiguous too. Neither religion nor any other spiritual philosophies are apart of what he explains is the measure of his success as a man.<br /> So when one thinks about the saying, &quot;The true measure of a man is not what he accomplishes, or in the wealth he may acquires. It's found in the lives he touches,&quot; does Mr. Poitier's life measure up? Read his book and you'll know the answer!<br /> Reviewed by Marliveot; Even though I enjoyed much of what he talks about, I felt that some of his writings rambled on, and at times were out of place with regards to the book's chapter.

What she discovered was the same business on a larger playing field.<br /> Eventually, her travels brought her full circle and landed her back in Bigelo, Arkansas. Sugar's return was met with silent hostility, but she was in a familiar place, 'alone'. Pearl, Sugar's next door neighbor, had stopped living 15 years ago.

Yvonne Grays Nathane tells a story that many professional African-American women and men can relate to. The story is filled with the struggles that people deal with on a daily basis in corporate America.<br /> Nathane gives equal time to the villains in the story. It is not stacked in a one-sided us against them fashion. The enemies are black and white. The office politics displayed in this book had me talking to myself many times. I found myself telling Charvette to quit that job and move on.<br /> Some components of the story were unrealistic because Charvette had talent and experience in a very exclusive field, yet she felt unqualified to seek work at any other venture. While Charvette had legitimate experience and skills, others in the story had little and were promoted based on whom they slept with.<br /> Working In The Dark is a compelling read which sheds light on some of the struggles of people of color in the workplace.<br /> I think the story would have been better if the characters were developed more and if the dialogue was used in a more effective manner. At times, it seemed as if the characters were giving motivational speeches. Also, throughout the book, Charvette's ex-lover is mentioned as someone prominent in her life; however, he is never presented in the book in any real way. When he is mentioned, it is usually in the form of a memory of a sexual experience.<br /> Despite the flaws, I enjoyed Working In The Dark, partly because I could relate to some of the plights that were faced by the protagonist. Also because I enjoy the image of a Sister handling her business, dressed to the nines, and sporting a natural style. AND the cover of the book is gorgeous!

COLUMBO HAS NOTHING ON LINCOLN KELLER	Ex-Raider, Ex-Cop turned Private Investigator, Lincoln Keller is back in Silent Suspicion overturning plots and notorious deeds of deceit. This time around Linc is hired by high profile Judge Warren \\"War Zone\\" Henderson and his wife, Sylvia to investigate the eight year old unsolved murder of Deborah Norris (Sylvia's sister). Deborah was a freelance journalist who was murdered during what appeared to be a robbery, but the Hendersons do not accept that explanation. Since the case is unsolved, it is still considered an open case by the Detroit Police Department and this causes Linc some apprehension because the presiding detective is Lieutenant Nick Knackton. Knackton and Linc have a long standing beef which is fueled by his jealously over Linc's involvement with Detective Candy Malone. All of these factors combine to make an engrossing mystery.<br /> When Linc first took the case, he thought that it was pretty clear that Deborah's death was a robbery turned bad and expected that he'd do a little investigation and bring it to a close in two days with the same conclusion that the police had made. However, after spending little more than 24 hours on the case, Linc felt there was more to the story then just a robbery gone bad. As Linc gets deeper into the investigation, he encounters past friends and acquaintances of Deborah Norris who seem to have something to hide. A myriad of characters enter the story who are far from girl and boy scouts.<br /> Political cover-ups, adultery, blackmail, and crime rings are just a few of the obstacles that Linc encounters as he digs into the past. Along the way, readers are reintroduced to some of the characters from Meadows' previous book, Silent Conspiracy, namely, The Keller Brothers, Julie, Night Life, and Tank among others.

A Sociological and Psychological Look Into Urban Mississippi	Scripts: Sketches and Tales of Urban Mississippi, is one of the most thought provoking books that I have read. Among the pages you will find several short stories where a character is mentioned, turn the pages and you will find more insight into that particular character as he/she is introduced in their own short story. The book provides the reader with life in urban Mississippi and the Delta area of Mississippi.<br />The opening story, Transition, is the tale of a family's flight from rural Mississippi to Jackson, Mississippi. The following story, Poni's Trail, takes the reader to New York City, back to rural Mississippi and finally Jackson, Mississippi. Along the way, you meet engaging characters with anger and confusion. One theme that resonates through the pages is ART. The reader is provided with what art and making art means to the characters. There is much confusion as to creative art and the business side of art. The reader also gets a glimpse of some historical issues and my favorite piece is the explanation and history of the HBCU existence, its failures and successes.<br />While the short stories are entertaining, they provide a sociological and psychological view of the people of Mississippi. If you are a native of Mississippi, a student in the Mississippi school systems or a college student, this should be required reading. Warning: some violent content, but the history provided is enormous.<br />Reviewed by Dawn	2001-08-26

But maybe dinner with her best friend and her husband, would change all that for Joyce, there was a new a coach at the local high school and her friends wanted her to meet him.<br />Along with Joyce's desire to live again was her dedication to the young women whom she lived for at the Sewing Circus, this was a group she started for young women to meet and learn different skills. She was trying to teach them how to be free women. Most of them had started adult life much too soon and Joyce was trying to slow them down or at least show them a better way.<br />Ms. Cleage's gift for telling a story made this tale of Joyce's rebirth so sweet and she again reminded us how Joyce handled drama with such ease. Pick up this book for a nice quiet read and find out if Joyce really had the nerve to wear a 'Red Dress'.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-08-26

Ely then returns to the plantation after making a fortune and buys the plantation from the owner who is unaware of whom he is and Ely frees the slaves of the plantation, making them free townspeople. The Beauville curse is started when Ely marries the former owner's daughter who is his half sister. <br />The List, debut novel from Patti Flinn is laced with suspense, intrigue and small town rife. Beginning with the prologue, the reader is kept spellbound by the events that occur. She first introduces us to the scene at the Beauville Estate. This scene is the official engagement party for the Beauville men. Three of the participants are outside and they are very angry. The argument leads one of the participants to lose their cool and a terrible accident occurs. This scene is the beginning of the best suspense novel I have ever read. Pierre Beauville, deceased patriarch of the Beauville family was everything that is evil. <br />Pierre had four sons whom he hated with a passion. He abused his sons mentally, physically and emotionally and controlled every aspect of their lives. He ruled his family with an iron fist. Remember, Pierre is a descendent of Ely Beauville. Pierre found a way to continue his control over his sons' lives from the grave. His last will and testament contained a list that specified the names of women who he chose for his sons to marry. His sons would inherit one hundred million dollars, but their only choice was the women whose names appeared on The List. The will also stipulated that the sons must marry before the youngest son turned twenty-one and remain married for three years. The Beauville family has been plagued with onecurse after another but they have continued to prosper. So they really believe that an arranged marriage will work. The Beauvilles are suddenly slapped with another curse and their world comes tumbling down. <br />The main characters in this novel are the four Beauville men and the women they marry. The characters have their own problems and history. There comes the time for healing and each one somehow finds their way to a different life. One person holds the truth and this is what sets them free. Flinn has created a novel of intense suspense. The storyline is not clear in the beginning but slowly moves into one of the most suspenseful novels you may ever read. Her description of each character is awesome and makes you believe that these are people you know. The plot is awesome and the ending is unbelievable. I have never read a novel with so much suspense! The storyline is like no other that I have read. If you want to read a good suspense novel read The List. <br />Reviewed by Dot	2001-08-26

You share each ladies struggles and you share their victories. The characters were so real they seemed to slip inside of you. She presented real issues about addiction, low self esteem and the fear of AIDS, but she never let the drama overshadow the characters. As they reached a new plateau in their lives and in their friendship, you were right there with them. My reaction to this book. AWESOME! <br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-08-26
Never Say No	I am a true romance reader and I consider this book a wonderful addition to my collection. Subtle Secrets by Wanda Y. Thomas is a nice read with a light taste of mystery added to the mix. Starris Gilmore is looking for steady employment so she can adopt Danielle Kathryn Carter, a beautiful little girl who was left on the doorsteps of an orphanage when she was just an infant. After leaving behind a verbal abusive marriage, Starris feels she has truly found peace and love with Danielle, which she affectionately calls Dani. Starris interviews for a position with ROBY headed by Jordan Banks, but is turned down. Though she is perfect for the job, she is left with seeking employment elsewhere to ensure that nothing stands in her way of adopting Dani.<br />Jordan Banks is executive director of ROBY, a mentoring and job opportunity program for young males from the inner city. Jordan is still recovering from a marriage gone bad from the very beginning. His ex-wife is found murdered by an unknown suspect, and he soon learns he has a daughter who was left in a home for children in Atlanta. After bringing his daughter Jolie Kathryn Banks home, he vows to himself that he will never love or trust another woman again. Starris and Jordan become more aware of each other when they both find out that their daughters are best friends. The sparks begin to fly and the girls begin plotting ways to bring their parents together. What stands out is the fact that the girls not only get along well as if they are sisters, but they look similar in features.<br />Leaving the suspense right there, you are in for a wonderful romantic and intense story about people who are afraid to love again; afraid to face their &quot;demons&quot; and move on; afraid to forgive and forget, and afraid to love each other. As Starris and Jordan soon learn and reveal through a plotting siniser employee working for ROBY, and who holds a key connection to the girls' past, their love is finally tested.<br />Ms. Thomas does a wonderful job of staging every detail of emotion that anyone could endure after being hurt and so afraid to try again. I especially enjoyed her character development of Jolie and Dani, they will make you relate and smile several times throughout the story. As that famous saying goes &quot;out of the mouth of babes comes much wisdom.&quot; I also recommend that you read the author's note in the back of the book. You will learn that this storyline is very dear to Ms. Thomas. Thank you for making us understand and the continued awareness of parentless children needing to love and be loved. I highly recommend this for the romantic reader, you will not be disappointed. I applaud Ms. Thomas and graciously give Subtle Secrets a rating of 4.<br />Reviewed by Kalaanidoes a wonderful job of staging every detail of emotion that anyone could endure after being hurt and so afraid to try again.

Wishing On A Star	This first novel by Dr. Idelia Phillips is suspenseful  with hefty doses of romantic interludes.<br />Connor Phillips has been acting Chief Legal Counsel  for Ellenton River Company for the past two months. When the president announces who the permanent Legal  Counsel will be, Connor feels cheated, like something  has been stolen from her.  Immediately she contacts  an old friend to look for other employment. Since  Connor has been instrumental in developing a  procedure to safely dispose of radioactive waste,  she has an offer in three days.<br />The new firm that hired Connor is the legal counsel  for Hayes and Son Enterprises.  Hayes is currently  in a legal battle with Connor's former employee,  Ellenton River Company. Both companies submitted  identical proposals to the Federal Government,  which means one was stolen. Franklin Hayes III,  does not know if Connor can be trusted so he has  his security people tail her.<br />Now add to all of that, the fact that Franklin does  not trust women in general, he is spoiled and  egotistical and Connor has lit a fire in him. What  they discover while tailing her is that there are  at least two other people tailing her, also.  Now Franklin does not know if he should be afraid for her,  or if his heart should be afraid of her.<br />I expected an intense mystery because the story was  filled with double crossing, kidnapping and theft. But  this was a light mystery and the characters lacked  a certain depth. Though the book was entertaining and  the subject was an excellent one, there was an air of  predictability.  I applaud Dr Philips, for the research accomplished to  present this sensitive topic to the reading public. I look forward to more factual fiction from her.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-08-14
Frying Pan to the Fire!	Why would a 24-year-old woman marry a 68-year-old recluse? Melinda wanted freedom from an overbearing father and Prescott Rodgers wanted companionship, so the two married.  At the wedding were Melinda's parents and Prescott's attorney and friend Blake Hunter.  From the moment Melinda's and Blake's  eyes met a battle of restraint began. Five years later Melinda is a widow, and Blake is the executor or her husband's estate.<br />Melinda is very surprised that her husband was a millionaire and is equally surprised at the terms of his will. The will stipulates that before she can inherit his millions she must set up a foundation to combat illiteracy AND she must marry within 12 months after his death.    Though the good citizens of Ellicott City, MD have virtually ostracized her and have labeled her a kept woman.  Melinda still had suitors by the dozens, but she refused to marry to keep the inheritance, one loveless marriage is her limit. She is seriously thinking about forfeiting everything.  Two issues  prevent Melinda from just packing up and leaving town,  1)her life is in danger, someone is stalking her and 2)she is finally allowing her feelings for Blake to blossom.    But will the suspicions Blake harbors about her marriage to Prescott and her discovery of his role in creating the terms of the will, sabotage this relationship?<br />Ms. Forster has again given us a glimpse of what is really becoming a trademark of this gifted storyteller.  And she has allowed us to share the struggle for independence Melinda was so desperately seeking.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-08-09

A Self-Help for All Women	Jones and Joseph's non-fiction title, You Have The Power is broken into five sections:<br />-Inoculate Yourself with the &quot;I Love Me&quot; Vaccine -The Professional -Romance -The Financial -The Personal<br />Each of these sections are broken up into chapters that are written by way of the authors' personal experiences and through anecdotes.  The essential theme of the book is learning how to tap into your inner strength to find your power to have a successful life, whether that is learning how to love your inner child in order to love your FULL self, or understanding that  education builds confidence, or learning how to separate the personal from the professional, or how to find/look for the man for YOU..and how to keep him.  All of these things and more are found within the pages of You Have The Power.<br />The book is a quick-read and can...and should be used as a reference, to go back to when it can be used for your life.  If anything, this book will show all women that they are not alone in the struggles of their lives, however, I think in the midst of so many self-help books that are out today, this one may  be lost in the shuffle.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-08-09
Too Much Love!	This book started a little slow for me but by the time I was 3/4 th done, I asked myself three questions.  Was the story good? Yes; Did the characters evoke feelings? YES; And did the characters show growth? Yes.<br />This story was told by a nameless, sensitive man, who loved  his woman, almost to a fault.  Nicole stood at her wedding  ceremony, trying to respond to the Minister's question. Finally, she asked her groom if she could speak with him in  private; she explained that she was having second thoughts  and needed some time.  Reluctantly, he agreed and the wedding  was called off.<br />After the smoke clears, Nicole tells him she also loves  someone else, but will he stay with her? He answers yes.  She tells him the &quot;someone else&quot; is a woman but, will he stay  with her? He answers yes.  Several months later as he and  Nicole lay in bed she tells him she wants him to meet Ayanna,  will he?  He answers maybe?  After he meets Ayanna; yeah he  said yes; Nicole asks him if he will share a bed with her and  Ayanna?  Ok, see the pattern and you know what his answer  was, ummm hmmm.  The problem is Nicole had rules, she was the  only one who would share the both of them, no crossing the  line between him and Ayanna.<br />At one point I wondered if she could ask a question that he  COULD refuse?  However, when HE and Ayanna asks Nicole if they  could all share the bed and make it a three way coupling,  Nicole's answer was a resounding NO!  Was she selfish or was  she afraid?  And will he stay?<br />The families offered little support for the decisions they  made and the life styles they chose to live. And that added  to the drama as they all struggled to make decisions that  would change the rest of their lives.<br />Dickey has penned one of the most thought provoking,  controversial stories I have read in a good while. It really  stretched the imagination, but it was a story with a too  real feel to it.  You will hear this one reverberating off  the wall for quite a while.wall for quite a while.	2001-08-09
Singing HIS Praise!	Jacquelin Thomas' mainstream novel, Singsation is a warm  sensitive read about the love of singing, family and God.  This was the story of one Deborah Anne Petersen, from Villa  Rica, Ga.  Every time Deborah sings in church, she is  transported by a spiritual joy, yet she dreams of a larger  stage with a different audience.<br />After rapper Triage Blue, home visiting family, hears  Deborah sing, her musical wheels are put in motion.  Triage  encourages her to send a demo tape to music giants in  California, knowing they will embrace her voice. In a matter  of weeks, Deborah is living in California, and is a back up  singer for one of the countries top R&amp;B performers.

Her dying  words to Deborah are, 'I feel like I let God down'.  Now Deborah is having second thoughts about the direction  the music is taking her.  When she is approached to go solo and is briefed on what  her new image will be, Deborah's first thoughts are the  words she remembers from her many bible studies,  &quot;Be Careful What You Wish For&quot;.  Deborah stands not at  the crossroads, but at the Cross. She seeks divine guidance  as to which direction God wants her to go with her music.<br />Ms Thomas' move into mainstream fiction is a smooth  transition, she again displays her talent for telling a  genuinely human story. Now that she's gotten her feet wet,  I look forward to her diving repeatedly into mainstream  fiction's literary pool.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-08-09

Who would want to kill Ev and why?  Due to his abrasive personality and reputation as a ladies' man any one of the 3,000 individuals attending the conference could want him dead.<br />Enter Alex Powell, the latest African American sleuth/detective on the horizon.  She's sharp, she's smart, she's sexy, she's witty and her assistance is requested to solve the mystery.  Along with fellow columnist, Paul Butler, Alex will be recruited by an LAPD detective to conduct a behind-the-scene investigation where they will encounter  surprising and shocking turns of events.  As Alex and Paul get closer to discovering who killed Everett Carson they find themselves in danger and possible targets for murder.<br />I was excited to see that their was another author writing in the African American mystery genre...although the book fell a little short of my expectations.  Where was the tension, the suspense, the drama, the action?  Overall, Ms. Bates debut novel was well-written but I found it to be more entertaining than suspenseful.  At times,  I felt like I was reading about the Rich and Famous.  Bates spent a lot of time developing and showcasing her characters down to the types of food they ate.  It was refreshing to read about an often overlooked group ...the African American elite...the affluent...the upper crust...folks who jet set across the world, live in Beverly Hills, conduct multi-million dollar deals and would never be caught alive or dead in an inner-city ghetto...but unfortunately the vivid descriptions regarding what and who these folks were often got in the way of the storyline and read more like People magazine rather than a mystery novel.  Karen Grisby Bates has the skills to be a good mystery writer and I won't give up on her yet...however, in future series I hope she focuses more on the mystery/suspense rather than what people are wearing, eating and where they're vacationing.<br />Reviewed by Yasmineople magazine rather than a mystery novel.

Desperately searching for love she allows Wellington's mother to manipulate her actions. Before Melanie knows it she and Cynthia Jones, are playing a dangerous game that could cost them both dearly.<br />Soul Mates Dissipates starts out with an off da hook meeting and 60 minutes later they are sharing a kiss that could've started the fireworks on the 4th of July. The seductive power that exchanged between Wellington and Jada had moisture in more than one place on her body.<br />If this sounds like erotic drama to you, you're right. Hold on to your seats because Mary B. Morrison takes you on a ride you will not forget.<br />My initial impression of the author's message was &quot;sex clouds our judgements&quot;. After reading the title again I realized soul mates are spiritually connected, however, we sometimes get lazy and stop working, or venture to far fron our values. Someone once said anything worth having is worth working for. In my opinion a soul mate is definitely worth the work.<br />I like the way the author allowed us to watch the growth of several characters. Each had many hurdles to cross and they prevailed. Additionally, the story was compelling and flowed with little to no gaps.<br />If you haven't read this book order it now...this way you won't have to play catch up when the sequel is released.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-08-09
A Picture really can tell a story	Why do we protect secrets that can destroy us? The secrets in \\"Past Presence\\" changed the lives of three and destroyed two. In Gaye Newton's debut novel she does a magnificent job at spinning a web of suspense and love. Newton's style of writing is exactly as it should be, when it needs to be. Her characters leave you no choice but to root for them. <br />Carrie Morgan is the best friend I wish I had, Grandpa Jeff and Grandma Charlotte are the grandparents most of us grew up loving.  The heroine of the book Anitra Leigh Cole was one of my favorite characters. Her strength was immeasurable and her spirits were always high. To go through what Anitra did the summer of 1974 would've been enough to knock the average person over the edge. Anitra however persevered in more ways then one. It's hard for me to do a review for a suspense or mystery novel without giving too much away, but enough to make you want to read it.  This page-turner is a must read for anyone who loves a<br />good mystery filled with tons of suspense. <br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-08-02
Overnight Success	Singsation is Jacquelin Thomas' mainstream fictional debut novel.  Singsation was the first book that I've ever read by Thomas so I wasn't quite sure of what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was an entertaining and well written novel. <br />Deborah Ann has been gifted by God with a wonderful singing voice but so far the only folks who have heard are her family, friends and the members of her church family in a small southern town called Villa Rica, GA.  She yearns to be discovered and whisked away to Hollywood where she can become an international star but she's not sure of how to break into the industry.  Fate intervenes and overnight she goes from small-town USA to Miss Hollywood.  Triage Blue, is a homeboy who moved to Los Angeles and made it big in the entertainment field.  But as successful as he is he still hasn't forgotten his roots.  One Sunday, when he's home visiting his grandmother, he stops by Mountain Baptist Church and hears Deborah Ann's voice.  Realizing that she has a great voice (and that he's attracted to her) he encourages her to send a demo tape to him in Los Angeles so that he can forward it to a friend who's looking for a backup singer. In a matter of weeks, actually overnight, Deborah Ann goes from singing gospel in the church choir to singing backup for Lavelle Roberts, one of the country's top R&amp;B artists.   <br />Deborah Ann soon discovers that Hollywood/Los Angeles is quite different from her small hometown and that the glamorous lifestyle she's entered is more worldly than what she's used to or desires.  Deborah Ann always said that even when she made it as a popular recording artist, she would remember God, Prayer, Church and Bible Study.  But as the demands of her career increase and she's tempted by the pressures of the industry, she realizes that her spiritual life is floundering.  Can Deborah Ann really serve two masters? Tested by the temptations of the road and Triage, Deborah Ann struggles to hold fast to her faith.  She must search deep within herself to uncover her deepest desires and make a choice about God's place in her life.  <br />Singsation is a well-written book and was a delightful read.  I enjoyed reading about the entertainment industry and getting a behind the scene look at the intricacies of the trade.  However, at times, I felt that the storyline read like a fairy tale as everything was just too good to be true.  Nevertheless, I believe that fans of Jacquelin Thomas will enjoy her mainstream novel, and I look forward to reading other books by this talented author. <br />Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-08-02
A Spine Tingling Tale	Don't let the small size of this novel fool you; Mischiefmakers  is packed full of horror and spine tingling scenes that will make  you read swiftly wanting to know who will die next, and whether  good will win out over evil.<br />Mischiefmakers introduces us to Melissa Shelton.  Melissa has a  deep anger that festers in her soul.  An anger that is sparked by  a Reverend father and his spewing of the Bible at every waking  moment.  When Melissa embarks on one too many forbidden incidences<br />that incite her father, she is forced out onto the streets, where  she lives as a homeless person.<br />Though her anger grows in leaps and bounds, Melissa manages to  befriend Sarah, an older homeless woman, and a mysterious man named  Harry, who she becomes intimate with.  During a horrific rain storm,  Harry sexually takes Melissa against her will, thus beginning a chain  of bloody events that will ultimately bring about the war of good and  evil.  As long as Melissa allows her anger to eat her alive, evil has  a chance of winning against good; but will Melissa learn to let her  anger dissipate before it's too late?<br />I have to say, I don't read much horror suspense, but you can't help  but to read this grisly tale.  Smith does a remarkable job of  descripting the setting and the details of the characters.  You can  literally smell the sweat that drips from a fearful character.  The  dialogue flows easily, and Smith ties up all the innuances of the  novel, leaving the reader with a compact, yet fast-paced story.  I  will forewarn, just about every other page is packed with all the  elements one might see in a horror novel, blood, gore, murder and  mayhem, all vividly written by Smith.  If you're not of the faint  at heart, definitely check Mischiefmakers out!<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-08-02

Good Read!	Always, Now and Forever is a delightful and poignant debut novel from Sheila Lipsey.  Lipsey sensitively and clearly writes about a subject matter that is rarely addressed in fictional novels...the plight of those with physical disabilities who want to be loved and enjoy a relationship the same as others.<br />Stricken with polio as a young child, Clarye was always physically different from other children and as such was taunted and teased during most of her childhood.  As the years passed, especially during the teen years, the comments/words would hurt severely and impact her mental/emotional state and especially her self-esteem.  Since childhood Clarye has always expected the worst and even as she gets older her two closest companions continue to be fear and pain, although she would happily trade both of them for love.  Unfortunately, Clarye would marry three times but none of the marriages would possess love.  Instead, they would be filled with verbal and physical abuse along with pain and fear.<br />After surviving her last marriage, Clarye vows that she will only live for self and her two sons.  As a result, she puts her all into her career and becomes a successful writer.  When Clarye least expects to meet Mr. Right she does in the form of  grocery store magnet, Gavin Elliston.  Gavin helps Clarye to realize that with trust and faith in God that true love is possible if only she would open up her heart and give him a chance.  Unfortunately, Clarye's faith will be quickly tested and a tragedy will strike which quickly throws Clarye's world once again into a tailspin.<br />While reading about Clarye's heart-wrenching and often painful life, I experienced a gamut of emotions usually ones of sadness and despair  but very rarely happiness and joy.  This was surprising in that I thought this was a romance novel but it really read more like mainstream fiction as I longed for more sexual tension/excitement between Clarye and Gavin.  When heart-wrenching events happened I cried with Clarye.  When she seemed to have found her soulmate with Gavin I cheered loudly for her.  But I was deeply disappointed when she finally found happiness, romance, compassion and love that it would all be short-lived due to unforeseen circumstances.  I was taken back that after everything that Clarye went through that pain and fear would still be the biggest factors in her life rather than love.  The author left me with the impression that if you were physically challenged your life would be filled with more sadness than happiness and that love would elude you most times.  Hopefully as Ms. Lipsey grows as a writer and if she continues to write about those whom are mentally or physically disabled, she will show readers that even those with handicaps can overcome life's obstacles and have wonderful relationships.pened I cried with Clarye.

An Intricate and Well-Written Tale	Gaye Newton seamlessly travels back and forth through time and space to write her novel, Past Presence, a story about buried memories and the woman who must face her fears in order to reveal them.<br />Past Presence introduces us to Anitra Cole, a woman who has just been proposed to by her boyfriend.  She should be on top of the world, however,the simple opening of the ring box causes Anitra to freak out, to remember well-hidden secrets that travel far beyond her birth...to the year 1927.  A letter written in 1974 and a secret held between two young children in 1927 are the keys to unraveling a mystery that has plagued Anitra's family for decades, though no one has been brave enough to discuss it.  Anitra wants to change that, and through the help of her  lifelong friend, Carrie, she aims to do just that.  Anitra travels through the past, while a family member travels to the future, both in search of the truth that can finally enable their family to recover from the tragic events of the past.<br />The book is so intricate that to reveal more would be to spoil this terrific read for the reader.  I have to say, I've never read a book with so many time changes, but that is written in such a smooth way, you don't get confused while reading.  Newton does a good job in bringing Anitra's &quot;voices&quot; out, as she moves from adulthood to childhood and back, you can hear the change in her dialogue.  The story is very unique, and that alone makes this book a definite must-read.  My only problem - though small - was that I felt rushed in the end, like conclusions were drawn due to time or space, and I felt I needed more.  Aside from that, Past Presence is a wonderful read, and it's on my SHOULD READ list for others.	2001-08-02
Fast, Easy Read	Dippin' is a fast read that tells the story of Amber LeReaux and her relationships with her best friend Che, her husband Tyler, her next-door neighbor and workout buddy David, and Malik, a college student she meets at a club.  Amber is a graduate student in the psychology field in an unhappy marriage in which her husband seems more preoccupied with watching television  than with her.  Unexpectantly David comes into her life and he's right there sliding into position to say all the things that Amber needs and wants to hear.  The problem with this is that he's also married and not quite what he seems.  And, then there's Che, the typical preacher's daughter who seemed  more like an enemy than a friend.  Lastly, there was Malik....something about him just makes me smile.<br />The book goes from scene to scene showing Amber's inability to discern true friendship from reality as she slowly comes to the realization that a lot of the people in her life aren't what they seem.  She seems to take things in stride and accept the punches that are thrown at her without much question or debate.  The near-ending comes totally unexpected and will leave you  wondering what's going to happen next, yet it teaches the lesson that we must always go inside ourselves to find the truth.  Now, personally, I would've been giving some beat-downs, but I loved some of the interactions with the characters.  Yet, I found Amber's attitude (acceptance of things) a bit ironic because of her field of study.  One would have expected her to be a  bit more in tune to what was going on around her and have folks pegged, yet she seemed oblivious to everything as she battled her own demons and worked on being HER instead of who and what everyone else wanted her to be.<br />The end result?  Amber comes to terms with her shortcomings, with her relationships, and in the end, she goes deep inside herself and comes out with a keener sense of HER!	2001-08-02
Sweet Love Story	Lynn Emery's description of the lushness of the Louisiana Bayou,  had me visualizing the moss hanging from the trees and smelling  the sweet fragrances. The title Gotta Get Next To You is really two stories in one.<br />The main character Andrea Noble, a Clinical Nurse is returning  home to become the Director of the local health clinic.  Since she is a woman of color, and this after all is a small town in the deep south, she is surprised she has been offered the job. Then Andrea finds out she has received this position, because her mother Charlene had approached her father John Mandeville about giving his estranged daughter a chance.  She has mixed emotions but she still accepts the position.<br />The second story is really what generates the essence of this  story.  Years ago, Charlene, a sixteen year old black girl  finds herself deeply involved with the son of one of the riches  families in Louisiana.  The result of this liaison produced a  broken heart, a rebellious spirit and a baby girl with mixed  parentage, now 30 years later, Andrea is back home. She was  raised mostly by her grandmother and has never been close to her  mother.  She wants her mother to grow up and settle down, so they can bond as Mother and daughter.<br />The clinic has been losing money and equipment is being ordered but never seen. John Mandeville, who owns about half of the town, has hired a private detective and has planted him as a worker in the clinic. All is going well, he is gathering information and building his case, until he meets the new Director, Andrea Noble. Andrea was one of his primary suspects, but Mr. Detective, LeRoyce Matthews, is falling for her. How can he do his job without jeopardizing Andrea's position at the clinic? He wants someone other than Andrea to be the fall guy, and as the case progresses, LeRoyce is no longer sure who the culprit is.<br />This was a pleaurable read that painted a vivid picture of  Southern rules, Southern politics and Southern family power. It  reminded me of how life shows little mercy as it forces you to live with the consequences of your decisions.  I applaud Ms Emery's ability to share some real truths in a such a special and tender way.<br />Reviewed by aNNwer.

Reaching Your Dreams	If you are ready to read an emotional, spiritual, thought-provoking  coming of age novel of a young girl's struggle and turmoil in striving to reach her dreams, welcome to Born In Sin by Evelyn  Coleman. You will not be disappointed in the depth and strong story  line crafted by Ms. Coleman. This is a must read for everyone.<br />Keisha Wright is a fourteen-year-old girl who is streetwise and smart  in school. Her long-standing dream is to one day become a doctor.   To help fulfill that dream, she anxiously awaits news of her  acceptance into the high school program at Avery University. While at  school, Keisha is called to the principal's office along with other  students and is told she is being assigned to a program for &quot;at-risk&quot;  children for the summer.  Not only is she told she is &quot;at-risk&quot; but is also told that she is being removed from the college prep course  program where she has been getting excellent grades. This alone sets  the stage of a very revealing story of how the education community and society itself stereotypes our youth. <br />While attending the &quot;at-risk&quot; program with persistence from her  mother, Keisha meets and becomes best friends with Betty Shabazz and  soon develops a crush on her brother, Malik. Betty and Malik both have to struggle daily with a drug addict mother and alcoholic father. Becoming friends with Keisha helps Betty to stay away from  home as much as possible and from her parents environment. <br />After a beach incident, where Betty almost drowns when the lifeguard  decides to take his time to rescue her; and Betty's brother Malik  beats the lifeguard and is almost taken to jail, both Betty and Keisha decides it time to learn how to swim. What they soon realize is that they both have a talent in swimming and are asked to join a local community swim team. They excel in swimming to the point of  being considered Olympic hopefuls. <br />In the meantime, the lure of the streets and material things take  Betty to near disastrous results.  While fighting that same  lure, Keisha refuses to allow an opportunity to attend Avery University high school program pass her by, so she applies on her own  and is accepted. However, because she was removed from the college  prep program at school, she now must pay for the program herself.  Keisha's mother takes it upon herself to earn the money anyway she  can, keeping what she is doing from her family.  When Keisha and the <br />rest of the family speculates on what their mother may be doing to  earn the money, she follows her one night and is nearly raped. Still  not knowing what her mother is doing to earn the money for her to  attend Avery University, she becomes totally distraught to the point  that she feels she must indeed been &quot;born in sin&quot;. <br />Keisha, Betty, and Malik along with other strong developed characters  in Ms. Coleman's novel is scripted to a point that every person jumps  out at you with their own personal drama and real emotions. She draws  you into relating and becoming truly absorbed in what Keisha, Betty,  Malik and others must endure to reach their dreams.  <br />As stated briefly in the beginning, Ms. Coleman's novel takes you  through several emotions from laughing, sad, upset, angry, crying and  finally cheers. I personally experience them all. It is a wonderful  story where you will definitely close the book learning something very deep and relative to real situations and circumstances facing our youth today. You will truly enjoy the ending. I applaud Ms.  Coleman on a well-written book and highly recommend everyone read Born in Sin. I give it a rating of 5.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2001-07-29
Through Thick and Thin	I can't believe that this book has been out since September 2000 and I'm just discovering it! The title is intriguing and really made me wonder what was between the covers.  What I found was a story that was bold and sassy, honest and bittersweet with unexpected twists and turns that held my attention and that I quickly read in one sitting.  R.I.P. is a story that deals with the benevolence and woes of friendship.  Via the acronym R.I.P. Wash introduces us to friends Rambunctious Rashondra, <br />Ingenious Indigo, and Perfect Priscilla in her fascinating debut novel titled R.I.P. Til We Meet Again.  RIP are three sister friends who meet during freshman year via a study group and are rounded out by the sole male friend of the group, Walter.  The descriptor RIP appropriately describes each young lady as they all come from diverse backgrounds and live up to their names.  <br />Although  each friend is unique and very different they are able to put aside their differences to form a strong sisterhood bond which continues after they graduate from college.  Together they will share a multitude of experiences including Family Drama, Deception, Secrets, Adultery, Murder and Wayward Family Members.  However, a sudden tragedy occurs which ignites pain and mistrust and as a result, their friendship ends.  After two years and the trio is not back together, Walter intervenes to bring peace and harmony back to the ladies.  Walter knows that the girls miss each other, but it is their <br />stubborn pride that keeps each one from taking the first step to re-establish their friendship.  Since Walter was the friend who brought the others together he felt it was his responsibility to mend the rift that separated them.  But will Walter succeed in his endeavor? <br />They say a picture is worth a thousand words but the title is the key to discovering the depth of RIP Til We Meet Again.  When I found out how the title was interwoven into the storyline, I was moved from intrigued and excited to saddened and surprised.  I couldn't believe the bombshell that was dropped on me!  Wash is a delightful storyteller and I really enjoyed how she developed the characters by taking us through their childhood, college years and into adulthood.  The characters become personable to us as Wash makes them jump off the page and into our lives via the creatively crafted subplots.  RIP is a love story and a mystery tightly wrapped in an engrossing and compelling storyline.  I look forward to future novels from Sonya Senell Wash and I hope not to take as long to discover them as I did RIP. <br />Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-07-29

Sensual, Erotic, Passionate!	Fans of short stories and poetry will love this sensual anthology about love, life, lust, romance and erotica.  Making Love In The Rain by Marlon Green was divided into 3 sections which gave you a prelude to what the stories would be about in that each section led off with titles like-The Rain, The Storm and The Drizzle. I really enjoyed that this was a book that I could read at my leisure and take my time savoring the stories and the poems.  There were subjects that I could read alone or read to my partner as a prelude to a romantic interlude. Some of my favorite stories were:<br />Friday Nite Ritual about a young lady who enjoys basking in the nude on her balcony after a long, hard work week...however, she doesn't realize that she has company.<br />Just Us Three about a woman who makes the ultimate sacrifice...she planned a menage a'trois for her man's birthday.<br />Matinee about a couple who meet at the Tuesday matinee and continue this tryst throughout their love affair.<br />No More Fairytales about a brotha who survives being in the armed forces but is killed on the mean streets of the USA and his lover's attempt three years later to get over the nightmare.<br />Mr. Helper about a brotha who has always been so in love with women that he could not stand to see them mistreated in any way! Unfortunately when he goes to the aid of one sista he wishes he never got involved.<br />Making Love In The Rain offers something for everyone and readers will identify with stories about love, heartache, fantasy, eroticism and self pleasure.  Just one suggestion...in the next printing of this book could the author please use just one font...some of the fonts were difficult to read and as such I skipped over some of the stories/poems.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-07-29
Too Much Love	This book started a little slow for me but by 3/4 th done,  I asked myself three questions.  Was the story good? Yes;  Did the characters evoke feelings? YES; And  did the characters show growth? Yes.   <br />This story was told by a nameless, sensitive man, who loved  his woman,  almost to a fault.  Nicole stood at her wedding  ceremony, trying to respond to the Minister's question. Finally, she asked her groom if she could speak with him in  private; she explained that she was having second thoughts  and needed some time.  Reluctantly, he agreed and the wedding  was called off.  <br />After the smoke clears, Nicole tells him she also loves  someone else, but will he stay with her? He answers yes.   She tells him the &quot;someone else&quot; is a woman but, will he stay  with her? He answers yes.  Several months later as he and  Nicole lay in bed she tells him she wants him to meet Ayanna,  will he?  He answers maybe?  After he meets Ayanna; yeah he  said yes; Nicole asks him if he will share a bed with her and  Ayanna?  Ok, see the pattern and you know what his answer  was, ummm hmmm.  The problem is Nicole had rules, she was the  only one who would share the both of them, no crossing the  line between him and Ayanna.<br />At one point I wondered if she could ask a question that he  COULD refuse?  However, when HE and Ayanna ask Nicole if they  could all share the bed and make it a three way coupling,    Nicole's answer was a resounding NO!  Was she selfish or was  she afraid?  And will he stay?<br />The families offered little support for the decisions they  made and the lifestyles they chose to live. And that added  to the drama as they all struggled to make  decisions that  would change the rest of their lives.<br />Dickey has penned one of the most thought provoking,  controversial stories I have read in a good while. It really  stretched the imagination, but it was a story with a too  real feel to it.  You will hear this one reverberating off  the wall for quite a while.  <br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-07-29
Through the Looking Glass	&quot;I See Through Eyes&quot; by Eric Payne is a window into the soul of a young African American male as he goes about the chore of daily life in America. The poems are filled with reality and emotion.<br />  This collection of poetry is divided into six sections, they are: 1) Young Havin' Fun Wide Eyed &amp; Naive 2) Lamentations 3) Fires of Revelation 4) Perchance Romance 5) To Know God 6) Liberation.  My favorite section is &quot;Lamentations&quot; because it deals with feelings of the heart. In &quot;The Phone Call&quot; the poet reflects on Shannon a woman that he dated that had it all together, and he thought that they were both equally interested in each other. Then Shannon suddenly drops out of sight. The poet wages an internal battle with himself as to whether he should call her or just leave the situation alone. I know that at one point in my life I was in the same situation as the poet,so I could definitely relate to his plight.<br /> I really enjoyed &quot;I See Through Eyes&quot; and look forward to reading more of Eric Payne's work. On the RAW scale &quot;I See Through Eyes&quot; is a 4.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-07-29
Sexily Off the Hook	Michael Presley's debut novel had so much good stuff going on, I don't know where to start.  First the term  BlackFunk, from my understanding originated in the West Indies and it references a certain kind of ..., ump!  And with that said; this book brought issues about:  relationship, friendship, eroticism, ...,  infidelity, self esteem, and love.   Now that I have your interest, let me start at the  beginning. Andria leaves work with chills and a fever,  wanting to crawl between her sheets, but when she gets  there she finds her soon to be fiance in her bed with  another woman. After she throws him out, she tries to  take herself out.<br />Rashaun 'Blacky' Jones, earned his nickname because of his complexion. He has hated it and has hurt because of it, all  his life.  A self made man, he struggled and won, he is  a sucessful attorney and he's in love.  He's ready to  take his relationship to another level. While  rummaging  through his girlfriend's dresser to plant his surprise, he  finds a tape labled 'Blackfunk' and guess who has the  starring role?  Hurt and betrayed, he now has one goal in  mind and he programs himself to accomplish it.<br />Andria and Rashaun meet unplanned, on three different  occasions so against the vows they made to themselves,  they decide to stick their toes back in the water.<br />The cast of characters sharing this book were colorful  additions who added just the right mix to the story.<br />This book will excite you, eroticize you, overwhelm you,  and introduce you to some West Indies' style cleansings.  But it will not bore you.  I applaud Michael's efforts  in adding an interesting twist to this sexy tale.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-07-20
Engaging, Realistic, and Downright Hilarious!	Ladies, there is hope for us yet!<br />The Hearts of Men is a moving, refreshing tale based upon the lives of several African American males. The main character, Prodigy Banks, grew up in Philadelphia and was headed for serious trouble until the mother of a slain friend encouraged him to relocate and start over someplace else. He migrated to Atlanta where he fell into a life of auto theft engineered by a shady uncle. When one of his fellow thieves steals a car from an older couple, Prodigy feels bad after seeing it on the news and returns the car. That is when he meets Poppa Doc, the owner of the vehicle, and it is the best thing that ever happens to him.<br />Poppa Doc has seen a lot in his years and believes that Prodigy has potential to turn his life around so he finds him an honest job and mentors him into a man. However, Prodigy still has one problem: womanizing. Eventually, even that plays itself out and he decides that it is time to treat women with the respect and admiration that they deserve. Poppa Doc also helps to mold the lives of his biological son and his son-in-law, both men that have somehow lost their way. <br />The dialogue in The Hearts of Men is engaging, realistic and sometimes downright hilarious. I lost count of the amount of times I found myself laughing out loud. Travis Hunter is a wonderful novelist and I look forward to his next endeavor: Married and Still Looking.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-07-20

Wonderful Mix of Poetry, Prose and Essay!	Pam Osbey adds a wonderful mix of poetry, prose and essay to her debut  compilation, Musings of A Mocha Sista.  As an accomplished poet and  performer, one can definitely hear the lyricism in Osbey's poetry and feel  the passion and enlightenment that is evoked through her work.  Osbey's  poetry touches several facets of life, such as ethnicity, love, relationships,  and spirituality.  As some of my favorites:  &quot;I'ma Natural Gyrl&quot; is an anthem  of many sistahs who prefer to be free and true to their hair, &quot;Sacrifice&quot; will  put you in the spirit to glorify His name, &quot;Breathe&quot; takes you deeply into the  passion of love that intertwines and connects lovers, and &quot;Beautiful One&quot; tells  all sisters to stand up and be PROUD for being who you are.  ALL of Osbey's  poetry will bring a light of reflection and inspiration to readers.<br />Aside from poetry, Osbey gives us prose that is satisfying, while also offering  us a small taste of her upcoming novel, Saleria's Song.  After being delighted  by her poetry and prose, Osbey presents a couple of her essays that discuss body  image, satisfying your soul and being single, all of which are written in Osbey's  clear cut, yet conversational style.<br />I think everyone will find something in MUSINGS that will attract them to this  compilation, and I would definitely recommend it to others.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-07-20
JAM-PACKED Action and SUPERB Writing!!	Any fan of Mosley's will definitely want to read Fearless Jones,  and if you're a lover of a good mystery, this novel is a MUST have.<br />It was a typical day for Paris Minton.  He was busy minding his small  bookstore, when in walked Elana Love, a sister laden with beauty, sex  appeal...and a heap of trouble.  Elana questions Paris about a missing  Reverend, which begins a 24-hour period in which Paris gets beat nearly  to death, makes love to the elusive Elana, gets robbed, loses his bookstore  to a mysterious fire, and finds himself in the middle of a mystery too thick  to handle alone.<br />Paris recruits the help of his longtime friend, Fearless Jones, an army  veteran who can be cool, calm and collected one minute, and deadly the next.  After Paris pays the fine to get Fearless out of jail, the two embark on a  journey to find Elana and uncover secrets that are buried under years of  betrayal, money and murder.  If dealing with the bad guys isn't enough, the  pair must also face the harsh society of 1950s Los Angeles.  While battling  racist cops, the two use their individual strengths and wits to collectively  solve the mystery.<br />I don't think there are enough words to say how much I enjoyed this novel.  Mosley's writing style is pure beauty, with a rhythm and flow that lends itself  to music and poetry.  There's a cadence to it that creates a seamless piece of  fiction.  The characters are lively, their dialogue on point, and the storyline  is wonderful from beginning to end.  Mosley mixes in the harsh societal climate  of the time perfectly with this action-packed mystery, and as a new reader of  Mosley's work, I know that I will be rushing to read previous novels.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-07-20
Do You believe?	Shades of Black is a  fiction that read like a non-fiction to me, it  was more like a documentary than a story.<br />The back cover says Melvin Adams is in a six-year church hiatus and the meat of the story was taken from that one line.  After losing his  job and his girlfriend, Melvin begins to think he is being punished  for turning his back on the church.  I was surprised that this story was a continuous struggle to show faith in God, especially for someone  born in the church, who lived his first 18 years committed to it.<br />For six years, Melvin worked as an accountant, and had acquired a  position in management with the company.  His position was terminated  without notice, leaving him doubtful and bitter. Angered about the  termination and the fact that his girlfriend showed little sympathy  for his dilemma,  Melvin questions the power of God.  Only after  hitting rock bottom, does he decide to rededicate himself to God and  the church.<br />If you're looking for an intense religious read this is probably the  book for you, because at times it read like a scriptural recitation.  But from the opening chapter to the last, I never felt Melvin's  conviction to his rededication.  His faith was too weak, after each  obstacle, he turns away from God.  This book was filled with many  contradictions: Mel struggled with the idea of sex outside of marriage  because it was against the scripture, yet he indulged. He quoted  scriptures about love and forgiveness, yet he actually prayed something  negative would happen to his ex-girlfriend.<br />The cover described the title as the process of tanning darker shades of  black from the heat of adversity and it stated that  from this process Mel  gains an understanding of true love and recognizes the grace of God when he looks at his battle marks.  I was left wondering if he had accomplished  either.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-07-20
One CAN Overcome Adversity	Italy and Back tells the tale of Bobby Huntley's journey through childhood  and manhood, and the lessons that he learned along the way through his  military career and through his life.  In a simple writing style, Huntley  takes the reader through a life that had to endure the verbal fights between  his parents, the loss of a father, racism during his schooling, the love and  pride he felt for the Marines, the subsequent struggles of racism that he  dealt with in the Marines, his marriage, children, and the ending of that  marriage, among so many other things.<br />Though this story is only one man's tale, it still has the ability to touch  others, and to let them know that in life, there will be many obstacles, but  through your will and your belief in God, you can withstand them to reach your  goals.  Readers will find this book to hold many life lessons and inspirational  thoughts to take for their own lives.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-07-20

Entertaining and Hilarious!	Wow!  What a novel concept...take your tales of woe about being a broke college student and turn them into what just might end up being a best-selling book.<br />The names have been changed to protect the innocent, and although it reads like Mad magazine at times, Angela Nissel's debut novel, The Broke Diaries is a fascinating non-fictional novel about one sistas struggles to survive financially during her tenure at the University of Pennsylvania.  She was bright enough to be selected to attend an Ivy League school now she has to be smart enough to survive the financial challenges.  Written in a witty and hilarious tone, the reader witnesses up close and personal Nissel's senior year as a broke college student at a prestigious university. We live vicariously via Nissel as she experiences her first check cashing joint, sweet-talking the utility company man, using super glue to fix her car and scheming to get free books for her classes...actually securing anything FREE is an adventure in itself.  Her antics will make you LOL, say &quot;no she didn't do that&quot; and for some we will reminisce about our prior years as a broke college student.  Although I must caution that some of the antics in this book should not be taken seriously-after all to be a broke student is one thing-to be a broke student in jail is an entirely different manner.<br />The Broke Diaries is an entertaining description of Angela Nissel's life as a college student and a guide book I recommend for any student going off to college this fall.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin	2001-07-20

A Sad Reality	It was  hard to believe this was a debut novel, the  writing was just that good. This was a hauntingly sad  story of how domestic violence/abuse destroyed a family.   Aja, Eric and Jada witnessed something so tragic it sent   one to a mental institution, one to the bottle and one  struggling to maintain balance for everyone.  <br />Aja James is a survivor, the oldest of three siblings she believed it was her duty to make life better for her brother and sister.  But as she watched Eric, she<br />wondered if history would repeat itself and she knew  time was running out. Still, how could she help them  when she too could not forgive or forget?  Aja was so  committed to saving them, she is ready to put her life  on hold. When she meets handsome sportscaster Charles  Clayton, she is shocked to know that she can't love  him because her heart is too full of hate.<br />This was an exceptionally written story about a sad reality. It left you sitting quietly, feeling the  pain of a yesterday that the three could not erase.   My heart ached for Aja, Eric and Jada, because they  each suffered with their own personal demon as they  struggled to live just one more day.  Ms Billingsley  should indeed take a bow for this one and she should poise the pen for another.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2001-07-20

Do You Have Faith?	Can our youth blind us to love and relationships? In Leela &amp; Jack's case I believe that's exactly what happened nineteen years ago. Leela Taylor was a freshman in college, while Jack Hamilton worked on his masters. They dated and fell passionately in love.<br />Jack told Leela when he received his masters they would get married, but in the meantime he asked, &quot;Why don't you move into my apartment?&quot; Thinking Jack was toying with her, her reply to him was &quot;That's a lovely idea Jack, will you ask my parents? Freshman needs permission to live off campus.&quot;<br />Leela realizing Jack was serious began to feel emotionally trapped.  She feels she could love Jack without the committment. Leela wants to soar. A couple of months later she leaves town without Jack. Jack on the other hand feels Leela didn't love him enough to stay. Seven months later a baby is growing inside of her. She goes back in search of Jack. Believing he has left with another women she is hurt.<br />I don't make it a habit to read romance because some of them you have to have alot of faith. This story tested every ounce of faith and patience I had. While Jack and Leela were trying to rekindle a nineteen year old love, Professor Forrest, a scorned women drives a wedge so deep between them Leela finds it hard to find her way back, then while their renewed love is so fresh and fragile, Brian, Jack's friend who does something innocent causes another eruption for Jack and Leela.  Does the relationship make it or is it singed forever? Read the book ...seeing if you have Fate.<br />I gave this book a 3 because in my opinion it had one too many twists and turns, also Leela and Jack's characters are nothing like the couple on the cover. Leela had locks and Jack was described to have a well-muscled body. <br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-07-20
Collection of Short Stories	Blackberries, Blackberries is a fictional debut novel from Crystal Wilkinson.  It's a compilation of short stories, about African American women who're struggling to survive in the rural South.  Stories of hard-working women that we can identify with and experience their trials &amp; tribulations, their laughter and happiness,  and their sorrow and tears. Poignant stories about working woman, their relationships, their families, their children and their friends.  Wilkinson's stories penetrate our bones and souls and leave an emotional impact long after we've read the last story.  Most of the stories are told in a narrative format and it takes the reader several stories before they get into the flow and style of the author.<br />With that aside, the reader will enjoy that each story is different and unique and creatively crafted.  There are 18 short stories in this 180 page book.  Some of my favorite stories were Tipping The Scales a story about a woman who finds Mr. Right when she wasn't even looking; Mules about a young girl who confronts a predator and wins; Waiting on the Reaper about a lady who's young and now is old still waiting for ole man death; and Peace of Mind about a single mom who has a couple of weeks to herself from her 3 young sons who are away at summer camp.  I really enjoyed Peace of Mind as it was one of the few stories that involved dialogue.<br />Wilkinson's stories come from the ordinary and the extraordinary.  From black, country women with curious lives.  From struggle, from fear, from love, from life, from the gut, from the heart.  Black and juicy, just like a blackberry.  If you enjoy short stories, stories that are matter-of-fact and told from a narrative perspective then check out Blackberries, Blackberries by Crystal E. Wilkinson.<br />Reviewed by Yasmin A.

The book is full of interesting subplots including Joe's possessive girlfriend who becomes his ex-girlfriend once Joe meets Sierra. There is an interesting twist in the novel when it turns out that Raymond was also bedding his fiance's mother.

Full of Every Emotion Known to Man	After reading My Brothers Keeper, I find it hard to believe this is a debut  novel. ReShonda Tate Billingsley is a name that literary readers will come  to know and love. This novel is by far one of the best debut novels I've read  to date and has been placed thus far as one of my best reads of 2001. <br />ReShonda takes us inside the lives of the James' clan, at one time the picture perfect family with a loving father, doting mother and three carefree children.  That is until the patriarch of the family loses his job and with that his identity as a man.  Their father's only sense of self-worth is in the nearest bottle of alcohol, a dime bag of ... and the bruises he leaves on the woman he promised to love 'till death do us part'. One night during his tirade Gerald (father) goes too far and forces his children to come to the aid of their mother. Their son Eric and youngest daughter Jada comes to their mother's rescue while Aja (pronounced Asia) stands by and does nothing. The course of events that happen that night will change their lives forever. <br />Meet Aja who thirteen years later has taken on the role of Eric and Jada's keeper. Aja seems to have it all; great looks, a job she loves and a best friend that personifies the true meaning of sisterfriend. However,  Aja uses her siblings as a crutch to hold onto the past, avoiding all future happiness with handsome sportscaster, Charles Clayton.  Charles is the epitome of the perfect man, willing to stand by Aja as she deals with her ghost from the past.  Their romantic attempts are continuously interrupted by Eric, who's anger has become parallel to that of their father. Eric is an NBA hopeful who's so concerned with not being like his father that he becomes him anyway. Aja and Eric complement one another's anger as they continue to wallow subconsciously in the past, harming all those who love them emotionally. Jada is the only one who seems oblivious to the incident that occurred so many years ago, as it has lefther mentally handicapped. <br />Mrs. Billingsley does a wonderful job of teaching us the pitfalls of  harboring hatred and anger. She immediately pulls you in from the very first page and holds you captive until the end. I found myself laughing out loud, wanting to shake the characters but she threw me for a complete loop as I got near the ending of the story and cried as if I had lost my best friend. My Brothers Keeper is a wonderful read, full of every emotion known to man. If I learned one thing from this book is that a child should be protected, but that's not always the case. We may not be responsible for the things that occur to us as a child, but we have to find a way to overcome it or it will destroy you in one way or another. <br />Reviewed by Tanya	2001-07-04
IS THREE A CROWD?	What would you do for love?  Have you ever loved someone so much that  you would sacrifice your true feelings for theirs?  Have you ever  loved someone so much that just to have a piece of them was better  than nothing at all?  Well, in Eric Jerome Dickey's latest novel,  Between Lovers,  we come full face with a love triangle at its  worst...and its best!  We are introduced to Nicole, Ayanna, and our  narrator, an established author.  At the apex of the triangle we have  Nicole, a self-sufficient, hard working and hard loving woman who's  torn between her two lovers, Ayanna (possessive and aggressive lawyer  that Nicole lives with) and the narrator of the story who is Nicole's  ex-fiancé that she left standing at the altar.  He also happens to  write about her in all his books. <br />From the first scene we're taken into Nicole's world as she juggles  both lovers from day to day and instance to instance; ensuring that  she remains aware of who's &quot;dime&quot; she's on.  We are thrust into the  world of this threesome in a hard-hitting way that leaves you  breathless, wondering what will happen next, and a bit intrigued with  the whole situation.  Nicole is adamant about loving both of them and  doesn't plan to give up either, so she tells them that if they love  her, they will all come together as one and allow her to continue  loving both of them.  Both of her lovers are hesitant and combatant  at their first meeting, yet they throw aside their caution and dive  into a relationship of one man and two women with Nicole setting all  the rules and demands.  Will this arrangement work?  Better yet, who  gets to go first with Nicole and what affect does it have on them all?  And, will the two lovers settle with pleasing Nicole only or will  they venture out and try to test the waters of a full-blown threesome  by loving each other?   <br />This is definitely a book that I would recommend to others and it is  my favorite Dickey book to date, of the three I've read.The writing  is smooth, sensual, and written in a manner that makes you wonder if  an arrangement of this sort can survive.  Dickey also does a great  job of personifying the characters allowing a glimpse into the all-  around aspect that makes them who they are and why they act and react  as they do throughout the book.  I must admit, in this type of book,  you have good guys and bad guys, but I can honestly say that I hated  all the characters at times and then other times I loved them.  I  didn't know who to root for to end up with Nicole or if she deserved  either of them. <br />To this novel Dickey also adds a cast of supporting antagonists in  the form of Nicole's Bible-Thumping, Chicken-Carrying, Perfume-  Wearing Mother, the narrator's Father, a famous Activist and  Minister, and also the narrator's best friend, a comedian with  a &quot;player&quot; mentality.  All of these characters add to the book in  many ways, bringing both humor and sadness to the forefront. <br />And, while I'm being honest, I will admit that I did not expect nor  necessarily like the  ending, but I did love the way Dickey told it and I found myself smiling  and reflecting on all the things that go on &quot;between lovers.&quot;  I  would definitely recommend this book to others and would also list it  as one of my best reads for the year.   <br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Cynara, also known as Cinnamon or Cindy, is a mulatto who works in the big house and competes for the love of her Mammy mother, with the white children that her mother cares for. The competition between the master's other children and Cynara becomes so intense that Cynara is sent away.

Cynara is now living and working in a flophouse. It is in this flophouse that she meets the handsome and mysterious R. He is a former Confederate soldier who has settled in Atlanta. R. showers Cynara with the finest things that money can buy, even a beautiful home. However, the one thing that R. does not give Cynara is the priceless gift of respect. R. is a married man, his wife is Cynara's half-sister, and he has never once called Cynara by her given name.  Instead, he refers to her by her slave names of Cinnamon or Cindy, and if they have personal disagreements he treats her harshly.<br /> &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; sheds light on the lives of former slaves during the Reconstruction Era. There is a black man who is elected to Congress, there are black physicians, and black property owners. This book is based on Cynara's diary, and allows readers to see this critical time in history through her eyes. &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; was well worth the wait, the court battle, and the controversy, on the RAW scale it is a 4.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Witty and Fast Paced!	Regina Harris's life hasn't always been happy.  At a young age she had  to withstand the abandonment of her father, the death of her mother, the  drug addiction of her sister, and the raising of her sister's baby.  Roaming the streets of Harlem and doing whatever she could to take care of  herself and the baby Renee, Regina found herself mingling in the darkest of  deeds.  A night that ends in gunfire becomes the turning point to Regina's  life and she vows to clean up her act and to prove to herself and to everyone  that she is SOMEbody.  Years later, she has proven herself in her education  and career and has met the handsome law student Charles Whitfield, who comes  from a wealthy family.  As their romance and Charles' career blossom, Regina's  past rears its ugly head and with it, she must reevaluate her life to figure  out what she must do to be truly happy.<br />The first thing I got from reading Miller's novel Satin Doll is the subject of  friendship.  Despite all the drama that unfolds in the book, the friendship of  Regina and her three girlfriends always manages to help one of the character's  persevere through a problem.  Miller's writing is witty and fast-paced, and the  dialogue between the characters rang true.  I truly enjoyed Satin Doll, and I  would definitely recommend it to readers.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-06-22
Romeo &amp; Juliet for the New Millennium!	J. J. Murray's debut novel, RENEE AND JAY is the interracial Romeo &amp;  Juliet for the new millennium.  A snowstorm leaves Renee stranded out  front of Luchesi's restaurant, where she meets the owner's son, Giovanni,  aka Jay.  Though Renee professes herself to be strictly into black men, she  finds herself very intrigued by Jay, and by the next morning Renee and Jay  are wistfully thinking of love and a relationship with each other.  Renee's  own pessimism plays a key role in defining her could-be relationship with Jay,  but her mother and Jay's father...as well as their small-minded community  questions the &quot;colorful&quot; relationship.  If that's not enough, the surprise of  a baby drives everyone, including Renee into even more confusion, but Jay is  steadfast in his love for Renee and is determined to prove to her that the two  make a perfect pair.<br />Renee and Jay is a great read, and I really could not stop reading it until I  got to the last page.  The characters were outrageous and funny, the humor in  the novel was obvious.  I will admit; however, that the story is heavy with the  &quot;my people&quot; comments presented by Renee, the main character, and oftentimes, I  found myself saying, okay, we get it, you're black, it was that thick at times.  Aside from that, the story was funny and well written, and I think Murray did an  excellent job with this debut novel and the subject matter, and I look forward to  reading more books by him.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-06-22
An American Icon!	Born Sarah Breedlove in Delta, Louisiana 1867, later dropping Sarah and changing her name to Madame CJ Walker, as we know her today. In 1875 Madame Walker was parentless because disease was rampant in the Mississippi Valleys and it is still unknown what her parents died of, yet their death made Madame Walker determined to succeed.<br />It was wonderful to finally be able to dispel the untruths that have been around for eons about Madame C. J. Walker. Though Madame Walker didn't invent the straightening comb; she was a pioneer in the hair care and cosmetics business, at a time when black women were earning $8.00-$20.00 per month, Madame Walker's business was averaging $300.00 a month. To show how successful the Walker Company was in 1919,  that year the companie's gross was $486.762 or the equivalent of $4.8 million today.<br />In the 1900s Madame Walker opened her first Lelia College, to train what was called &quot;Hair Culturists.&quot; She also built a factory in Indiana housing her hair care products called Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company.<br />It was extremely exhilarating to read this book about such a smart, courageous and daring woman. As well as learning about those who came  into contact with her. Just to name a few: Langston Hughes,  Paul Robeson, and many many more.<br />Today the Madame Walker Theatre Center in Indianapolis, which was home to the Madam Walker Manufacturing Company, is a National Landmark. One of my favorite quotes from this wonderful biography of Madame C.J. Walker is: &quot;I had everything I wanted in Life. I just didn't have it long enough&quot; quote from A'Lelia Walker.<br />My sentiments exactly,  it just wasn't long enough!<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-06-22

Ambrosia has vague memories  of a father who abandoned her some 20 years ago, taking with him the missing  piece of herself. She lives in Denver, Colorado and works as a researcher,  digging up facts and statistical data. She has spent 5 years searching for  her father and has finally decided that he doesn't want to be found, so she  has ended her search.<br />Ambrosia was approached by handsome Justus Nadamo, a Majidian warrior from  Uzira.  His request was for her to assist in finding the King's wife, the  Queen of Uzira and his two daughters, whom the King had not seen in 20  years. The King is dying and his last request is to see his estranged family  and prepare his daughter to assume the role of ruler of Uzira.  As Ambrosia  starts her search, she stumbles across more than she bargained for. A  stunned Ambrosia is reluctant to believe what she has found.  Queen Lysette  Harikeem in 1980 legally changed her name and the names of her two daughters.<br />The princess is found and the adventure begins. Does the princess travel  with Justus to Uzira, to reunite with her father and save the country from  an impending war? Is this the missing link and the excitement she has so  often dreamed about and can the princess live with the Uzirian law that  says Royal blood cannot mix with that of a common warrior?<br />T.T.

She is transported back to her 5 year old childhood, where  she was witness to a horrible event.<br />At times the issues of the other patients and characters seem to dominate the story, it's as if several different stories are about to take off and Babe's was not the most important one.  <br />I give this book a 3 on the RAW scale.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-06-22
Are You Ready For Your Calling?	I truly enjoyed this book, from the first page to the last. I was laughing  and shaking my head in that &quot;sho you're right fashion.&quot;  I always thought  anything to do with &quot;gawd&quot; had to be serious, but Pat proved me wrong.  This satire was comedy at its best.<br />I think all of us can learn a very important lesson from Sister Betty's  phone call. It takes more than going to church, humming a hymn or  being able to recite verses to be a Christian. Keep your eyes, ears and heart open, because &quot;gawd&quot; can come to you in any form.<br />The next time someone crosses your path or your phone rings,  answer it with more than sight.

For those interested in a mature, sophisticated and suspenseful  read...tinged with romance, you definitely need to pick up Evelyn  Palfrey's novel, &quot;The Price of Passion.&quot;<br />Vivian has been married to Walter -- a political big wig -- for  nearly twenty years.  Her love for him has gone sour over the  years due to his fall into the political world and his many &quot;late  night affairs&quot; he had to intend to.  Vivian seemed almost unfazed  by his outside activities, that is until one night he comes home  with an unwanted visitor...a baby by a former lover.  He drops the  baby off to her and precedes to have not even a passing thought  about the child.  This infuriates Vivian to no end and she makes  plans to leave Walter forever, but her unexpected love for the  child, Passion...as well as her long since vanished hope of having  a child, creates dilemmas and obstacles for Vivian to hurdle over.  Complicating matters are the whereabouts and identity of Passion's<br />mother...and Vivian's growing feelings for Marc, a professor who  finds himself falling hard for Vivian.<br />The Price of Passion is a thick read at 383 pages, but Palfrey has  so many nice elements in the novel that you don't feel daunted by  it.  This novel is as much a romance as it is a suspenseful mystery.  Palfrey mingles several plotlines and characters into one seamless  novel.<br />Furthermore, what's also interesting about the novel is that Palfrey  has a reader survey in the back of the novel that mentions how she  doesn't go into description with her characters in order to allow the  reader to be more interactive with the story.  At first I thought that  would turn me off, because I like having concrete visions of  the  characters that authors usually supply, but I found it a great treat  to create the character with their personalities given to me...definitely  made for a more interactive and interesting read for me.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-06-14
3 of A Kind beats a Straight	I chose this book because I thought it was a chronicle of stories.  Stories of black gay and lesbians, not an analytical outlook on the community.  Delroy Constantine-Simms mentions in the introduction that this book was  supposed to be an &quot;anthology of Black perspective that was either  sympathetic to or antagonistic toward the subject of homosexuality&quot;.  I wish  it was, instead the reader gets several essays that read like textbook  stuff.<br />If you're looking to read thought provoking essays then this is  the book to read.  You won't, however find comments from those who have a hostile point of view regarding the homosexual community.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-06-14
A Suspenseful Ride and DEBUT Novel	Jackie Daniels, teacher at an upscale African American  academy and daughter of a prominent D.A. is murdered, and  there is definitely hell to be paid.  Ed Dixon, a janitor  at the academy, is prime suspect having been spotted at  the scene of the crime, but he flees, going to the only  person he can trust, financial planner Audrey Wilson.  Audrey  meets newly arrived attorney Jules Dreyfuss, who happens to be  white, and pleads with him to take on Dixon's case.  Instantly,  there's an attraction between the two, which Audrey fights, but  there's a lot more important issues at hand, like a murder in  C. Maria Miller's mystery, &quot;Taxes, Death, &amp; Trouble.&quot;<br />Right off the bat, the novel is nicely written and is a fast-paced  read.  There are several storylines to sink your teeth into, such  as the mystery at hand, the &quot;maybe&quot; relationship between Jules and  Audrey, the political and police corruption that takes place in the  novel, Ed Dixon's past and how he comes to grips with it.  The novel  intertwines each of these storylines with ease, and I was actually  interested in seeing how each character's story would pan out.<br />One thing I thought about; however, was the fact that this is book  one of three Audrey Wilson Mysteries, but I don't know what exactly  Audrey Wilson had to do WITH the mystery.  She's an integral character  to the novel, but to the mystery, I didn't think so.  Knowing of other  authors who do series with a female lead (normally the detective or  investigator), I assumed Audrey would be that way as well.<br />But regardless of that, the story did pique my interest, and I look  forward to reading the upcoming novels to see what transpires.	2001-06-14
Surviving the times	Memphis, Tennessee from the 1960's to the year 2000 is the backdrop for Rosalyn McMillan's &quot;This Side of Eternity.&quot; The Russell family is one of many Black families living in Memphis during the 1960's, they are struggling to make it day by day, when unspeakable tragedy strikes the family not once but twice. To compound the stress on the family, the city's sanitation department goes on strike, and the family is in an even more precarious situation because the oldest boy Kirk works in sanitation and is the primary breadwinner for the family.<br /> Ann Russell, one of the books main characters is the youngest daughter. Kirk fails to handle things and because her oldest sister Mae just doesn't care.... as a result Ann is thrust into the position of caregiver and breadwinner for the family. She makes sure that everyone is taken care of and she tries to hold her family together. Included in the Russell family are nieces Nikkie and Bentley and nephew Wesley.  &quot;This Side of Eternity&quot; covers a span of almost 40 years and decades and years are marked by the major events of the times. I really enjoyed this about the book because as a reader it took me back to that period. However, the book did not move very fast. The flow of the book is hurt because the storyline goes off in so many different directions that at some points during the story, I was trying to figure out what McMillan was trying to say. On the RAW scale this book is a 3.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-06-14
Adventure, Politics and Romance...OH MY!	In her debut novel, Joyce Jackson pulls together a story full of adventure,  intrigue, politics, and that ever needed ROMANCE with much style!<br />The Reluctant Captive brings us Katherine Wellington, a D.C. financial advisor  who flies to Kenya in order to celebrate her uncle's new director appointment  into the World Bank, an organization that aids in supplying loans to countries  in dire financial straits.  Unbeknownst to Katherine, Kenya is in extreme turmoil,  and a rebel faction has been created in order to bring about justice to Kenyans.<br />Jackson Shugga, the faction's leader finds himself in a tight predicament when  Nziguniziju (N Zee to her friends) who is third in command wrangles the help of  fellow comrade David to abduct the new director's daughter.  The major problem?   They mistake Katherine for his daughter and abduct her instead.<br />Though frightened, a brave Katherine keeps her spirits up and her wits about her  as she deals with the rebels and their stone cold leader, Jackson.  The rebels'  goal is to use Katherine as a pawn to help Kenya, but what isn't expected is the  ignition of passion between Jackson and Katherine that explodes in the jungle's  heat.<br />N Zee is furious that her plan has backfired.  Being beautiful and devious has  allowed her to get whatever she wants from many of the men in the group, including  Kimya who is second in command.  But her feminine wiles have never snagged Jackson,  and when she sees his affection for Katherine grow, she vows to destroy their pending  love, by any means necessary. <br />I have to say, I could literally write a BOOK of a review for The Reluctant Captive.   This book contained so much that a review can barely do it justice.  I will admit, the  heftiness of the book (400+ pages) was daunting to me initially, but the story that  Joyce Jackson intricately develops is a great one.  The characters are thoroughly  fleshed out with great back story, the dialogue is crisp, the images that Jackson paints  of the jungle and happenings there are very realistic.<br />At the publisher's site (Genesis Press) they state that Indigo romances are sensuous  love stories with strong plots and are character driven, and this novel hits all three  points straight on the head:  detailed romantic trysts, tightly woven plots and characters  that jump off the page.  There were many things I enjoyed about this novel, but one that  I TRULY enjoyed was the strength of the heroine.  She was independent yet feminine, but  her will was just as strong as any man, and in romances, sometimes I have to swallow  hard with the &quot;faltering&quot; of the female characters whenever the male is present.<br />Joyce Jackson has written a wonderful debut romance, and her future as a romance  novelist looks very bright.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-06-14
Life's Choices	Let's travel to Jamaica, West Indies to the backdrop of this wonderful  story by Nancy Flowers Wilson. A Fool's Paradise is a coming of age  story line about Ann-Marie Saunders who is studying to become a doctor. Being a top A student, Ann-Marie is picked to study abroad in  the United States at her choice of prestigious universities.  Unfortunately, when she learns she is pregnant, things begin to take a turn for the worst.<br />Donovan, her boyfriend, is excited about becoming a father. However,  he has issues with her decision to pursue her medical studies abroad to the point that he will stop at nothing to make sure she doesn't go.<br />Ann-Marie is her father's &quot;star,&quot; and although he is disappointed in  her pregnancy, he still sees her reaching her dream of becoming a  doctor. Ann-Marie and her mother have an estranged relationship. Her  mother is closer to her sister Nadine and they both seemingly avoid  being around Ann-Marie. This hurts Ann-Marie very much and the only  person she feels comfortable confiding in is her best friend, Colleen, who has moved out of her mother's home after putting up with  years and years of verbal abuse. Colleen continues to toil with why  her mother hates and treats her so badly.<br />Ms. Margaret, Colleen's mother, has serious issues from the past that have  caused her to mistreat her daughter because she feels it is necessary to  ensure Colleen doesn't end up like she did. She escapes her issues by  degrading Colleen every chance she gets to the point that Colleen  finally stands up to her mother.<br />The overall story line revolves around the maturity, growth, and  development of people who are in love, starting to fall in love, and  have the determination to take charge of their lives. It is also about  the turmoil of one person's life and how they pass their issues on to their  offspring all in the name of protecting them.<br />The mixture of love, happiness, support, bitterness, sadness, <br />selfishness, reality and determination makes this book a learning tool  for anyone who must make difficult decisions to live their life and  reach their goals.<br />I commend Ms. Wilson for a well written novel which also depicts a  very nice cultural flavor and environment of Jamaica, West  Indies. You will truly enjoy this book. I give it a rating of 4.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2001-06-14
PAST AND PRESENT...KEPT IT REAL	&quot;The Harvest,&quot; a book by author Delores Mixon Smiley, is a book that starts out telling the story of a family and how it came to be and with this great start the reader is immediately lulled into believing that will be the course of this book, sadly that is not the case.<br />The book gives vivid details as to how the Mixon family came to be, all the way back to grandpa Robert Mixon who started it all. The reader then learns of the hard work and dedication that many generations of Mixon's brought forth to keep this family going. Had the book continued on this path, I believe that it would have been enjoyable, but unfortunately it did not.<br /> The author then switches the focus to herself and her accomplishments. They take up the full second half of the book. Please understand that I do congratulate Delores Mixon Smiley, on everything that she has done, but I thought the book was supposed to be about her family history.<br /> &quot;The Harvest&quot; also goes back and forth between past and present throughout the book. As a reader I found myself getting confused, and often times I just wanted to put the book down. On the RAW scale I give this book a 3 and that is because it started out so well but seemed to crashed at the end.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-06-14
The Title Says It All!!!	This is my second Naleighna Kai book, and it has left me thinking about M-E! There's personal lessons to learn in her books and in \\"More Than Enough\\" Lori and Diane show us how speaking and setting actions in motion gets you what you want.<br />Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; resides in New York where he's raising his 6 year old daughter Janesse.  Her grandparents are trying to sue Ray for custody because they think it's Ray's fault their daughter is dead. Shawna, Ray's live-in girlfriend, believes Ray is wrapped around her little finger, but she learns a very valuable lesson about love and appreciation.<br />Two women, best of friends, will do anything for each other's peace of mind. Lori tells Diane that she wants a man, Diane looks at her and says \\"Oh is that all?\\" Together in their Chicago home they comprise a list of 100 eligible men. Their plan is to pick the best one to give them love.  They narrow it down to three potentials; Raymond K. Hearne is one of them and he is determined to be the only one.<br />Lori met Ray online playing spades at MSN Zone. They took their chat out of the card room and into a chat room. Lori took Ray to a very unexpected orgasm during a phone call; this foreplay became a habit for them. Each enjoyed the others company and hearing their voices. That's how Ray got on the list.<br />A month later Ray met Diane and he was given suggested reading material by authors Octavia Butler and Sesvalah. They found out that he enjoyed the books as much as they did. After Diane and Lori compared the pros and cons of their previous relationships, they knew what they wanted in this one. They started a list of requirements for the three potentials.<br />This story is about a different kind of relationship: two women for one man, which in my eyes is \\"More Than Enough.\\" It's very interesting how they involve the children, and how it can be a reality for only a select few. If you want to know how Shawna learns about love and appreciation and to understand how Ray, Lori and Diane's story ends you must read this book. You'll be surprised.<br />Reviewed by MissyRay, Lori and Diane's story ends you must read this book. You'll be surprised.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-06-14
Sugar substitute?	Bernard and Simone were high school sweethearts.  From the moment he  saw her he knew that she was the ONE.  Together for 16 years, married  for 10, they were the first everything with each other.  Ten years  after their vows, they still have love, but they are at a crossroad,  the sweetness in the marriage is missing.<br />Their son Jonathan was born with Cerebral Palsy and Simone has spent  the last 8 years taking care of him and making Bernard's life comfortable.    Bernard, an aspiring writer has been working in advertising to pay the  bills as he slowly pursues his dream to write.<br />Bernard enters a Valentine day contest to win dinner for two and is  approached by the sponsors to do a weekly article in their paper.   When Bernard meets the editor of the paper, green-eyed Kathleen Cuttle,  he is acutely aware that his marriage is not what it used to be.    At her own crossroad, Simone realizes she does not have a life, and  wonders if her timing is good or bad, when she meets Mark. He makes  her remember what is now missing in their marriage.  From there the  writer shares a series of misunderstandings, that spelled doom for this  unhappy couple who were still in love.<br />Sugar Ain't Sweet, Duck's debut novel was a good read, I think what  prevented this from being a great read was the author's over use of  clichés and cute quips.  This was a story told with a sad reality, as  it searched for a solution when sometimes there really is none.   Phill <br />Duck's skills, at knowing how to weave an intricate story, were displayed  in this book; I look forward to his next literary expression.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-06-14
Walker is QUEEN of Gospel Comedy!	As soon as Angel-In-Training Joe Bell enters Heaven, he receives an assignment  that he must complete in order to receive his wings:  He must try to help the  wayward congregation - and their Rev. Knott Enuff Money - of the 'Ain't Nobody  Else Right But Us - All Others Goin' To Hell' church.  To help him with this  almost impossible task, Joe receives help in the form of Sister Betty, an elderly,  devout member of the congregation.  Joe must first show Sister Betty the &quot;light&quot;  before she can begin to help him in his quest.  When Sister Betty receives a phone  call from God while watching her soaps, it's only the beginning of this extremely  humorous tale.<br />Pat G'Orge-Walker is truly the queen and founder of Gospel Comedy, and her mixture  of God, love, spirituality, and humor are wonderful.  Walker has created characters  that are lively and animated, and her writing is crisp and witty.  Walker doesn't  try to browbeat you with scripture and morals, but she allows her story to entertain  the reader as he/she takes their own messages from the piece.  Reading this (and other)  spiritually humorous tales by Walker is a MUST for readers.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-06-14
From the Pulpit	If you missed some good old fashioned teachings, laced with plenty  scripture, then pick up a copy of Mama Said &quot;Get in the House.&quot;  Ms Allen's deep-rooted Christian Connection is very powerful in  this no nonsense guide to letting God in your house.<br />There are 11 short chapters that will enhance, enlighten and take  you back.  Back to when you didn't want to listen when 'Mama said...'  And it showed that once you've reached a certain age plateau, you  begin to realize that Mama knew more than you thought she did.  This book is an humbling read, if you will allow the words to touch  your soul.  The message I took from this, is if we would really  listen when being taught about what's good for us, we would escape  so many pit-falls, and would not suffer some of the cruelties that  life offers.<br />My last thought is we should stretch out our arms, let God in, He will influence your heart; and Embrace the Wisdom, because Wisdom has been  there, done that.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-06-14
POIGNANT PORTRAYAL OF LIFE AND LOVE	The Dying Ground is the debut novel by Nichelle Tramble.  In The Dying Ground, Tramble offers a poignant view of life in Oakland, California in 1989. Through Tramble's storytelling, we see Oakland learning to deal with its newest demon, crack cocaine.  The price of life with this demon is premature death and wasted potential in a time when the youth of the area are consumed with the Drug Trade and living a \\"Playa's lifestyle.\\"<br />The Dying Ground tells the story of Maceo Redfield in a quest to find who murdered his childhood friend Billy and his search for his lost love, Felicia who happened to be Billy's girlfriend and with him at the time of his murder. Tramble paints Maceo as a good guy from a strong family who managed to escape life in the drug trade through his athletic ability.  Maceo's investigation into Billy's murder and Felicia's disappearance draws him into a world that he used to watch from the sideline.  Maceo places both feet in a world filled with drugs and violence.  His desire to find Felicia is fueled by his unrequited love for her.  Maceo is accompanied and protected during his quest by his best friend, Holly.  Holly is a respected member of the drug community who has doubts about Felicia's innocence in Billy's murder.<br />Tramble tells an effective tale that is filled with action.  A number of minor characters are introduced in the book at various times.  The multitude of players can become confusing at times and readers never truly get to know Maceo.  Even though the story is told from Maceo's point of view, often he is telling the readers about others with very little insight into himself and his actions.  Throughout the book, Maceo is plagued by dreams of death that challenge him, but the dreams are never explored or shared with any of the other characters.<br />Nichelle Tramble's writing style is compelling and entertaining.  Readers will enjoy The Dying Ground despite the lack of development of some of the key<br />characters.  The Dying Ground is a 3 on the RAW Scale....Ground is a 3 on the RAW Scale....	2001-06-14
Finally a Beginning.....	Through the Fire is what I affectionately call a three-quel, it's the  sequel to a sequel.  And if you've followed the story of Quinten Parker,  you will embrace this story with open arms.  Rae Lindsay is convinced  that she will never love again, the tragic lost of her husband and her  5 year old daughter has left her cold and empty. She took refuge in the  only thing that still brought her comfort; her music.<br />Quinten Parker has existed for 3 years on good and bad memories.  He too<br />lost a wife to a tragic accident and he is unable to share himself with  anyone, unable to embrace life, and unable to feel and he does not take refuge  anywhere.<br />What these two lost souls brought with them was not baggage, it was  something worse, they brought guilt,  insecurities and mistrust.  They had  both erected walls so high, scaling them was impossible.  Their walls must  come  down,  but how?<br />This has been heralded a Romance read, but I beg to differ, it is a good  human story about life and death; about fears and conquering; about  love and forgiveness.  I strongly suggest you read the stories that  preceded Through the Fire, it will give you a better appreciation of the  struggle.  But this story will definitely stand firm on its on merit.<br />Donna Hill is an excellent story teller,  she has spun a story so heart  wrenching, it will have you mesmerized as you watch the lives unfold.  You will wonder if they can burn the past and  rise from the ashes.<br />An absolutely glorious read!<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-06-14
Strong Debut Novel!	Anne-Marie Saunders has a rosy future ahead of her.  Highly intelligent,  she is pursuing her university studies with the goal of becoming a doctor.  She is her father's &quot;star&quot;, but the light tarnishes somewhat when she reveals  to her family that she and her boyfriend, Donovan are expecting a child.  Her  mother and younger sister, both whom seem to have negative feelings toward  Anne-Marie, are most condescending to Anne-Marie's predicament, but she has more  to worry about as she is forced to decide whether to stay in Jamaica with Donovan  and child or go to America in order to pursue her medical degree.<br />Anne-Marie's best friend, Colleen is also going through strife in her life as she  deals with the painful relationship she has with her mother.  For the majority of  her life, Colleen can't remember a time when things were good between her mother and  she, and now older, she decides to go out on her own and leave the debris of their  relationship.  As Colleen's personal life begins to fall into place, her mother tries  to make a reappearance, seemingly seeking forgiveness for past transgressions...will  Colleen accept her mother's olive branch?<br />A Fool's Paradise, by Nancy Flowers Wilson was an interesting read.  I enjoyed the  backdrop of Jamaica and the flavor that the island represented in the novel.  The  two major storylines (Anne-Marie's and Colleen's) were nice concepts to build a story  on, and the reader will finish the novel for the sole purpose of wanting to know WHAT  will happen.  Though I enjoyed the storylines and their potential, I did find the  characters to be somewhat flat, and it was difficult for me to &quot;see&quot; them and get  immersed into their lives altogether.  I found the dialogue to be very well written  for the most part, but at times, I thought it thick, and it represented a glitch to  reading the novel smoothly throughout.<br />I think Wilson writes a strong debut novel, and her writing has great potential.  I  think there is a definite readership for A Fool's Paradise, and I look forward to  reading future works by this new author.I  think there is a definite readership for A Fool's Paradise, and I look forward to  reading future works by this new author.	2001-06-14

Connie mistakenly drops the payment off at the crematorium, and when Mother Pray  Onn finds out she is fit to be tied, vowing to set Connie Fuse straight at the next  prayer and testimony meeting...will Joe Bill and Sister Betty right this wrong in time?<br />I laughed OUT LOUD as I read this story.  Everything you expect to see at a church;  Walker provides the EXACT opposite in such a comical manner you can't help but to join  in on the zaniness of the story.  Walker's story reads like a conversation you might  actually hear, and the characters (and their names) you won't forget any time soon.  For readers who love witty humor and outrageous, jump-off-the-page characters, you'll  want to pick up CONNIE FUSE...and other Walker stories.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-06-14

Marcus Major's sophomore novel is a pleasant and well written story about five friends, their lives, their choices, and their relationships.<br />Four Guys and Trouble gives us a glimpse into the lives of Colin, Mike, Dexter, and Ibn;  four guys who have been friends since college.  Their friendship is welded together by their fraternity ties and a promise that they made to another friend, Trevor, who died of leukemia, before graduating from college. That promise was that they look after Trevor's little sister, Bunches.<br />Bunches is not so little anymore.

One day Tammy and Hassan meet and from then on things change for them both,  and their worlds will never be the same.<br /> This book is an emotional roller coaster, you feel the joy,  the pain, and the desperation of the characters.

Bad Beginnings, Traumatic Experiences, and More!	A story of bad beginnings, traumatic experiences, and strange behaviors,  of oxymorons, perseverance, and stamina.  The story begins with Ida Mae Belcher, a 17 year old black teenager, being brutally raped by 3 young white men.  But the issue of race in the story does not carry the full negative connotation that would be expected of the Deep South in the early  1960's.  Let me take you back, after the Klan killed Ida Mae's father, her  mother ran away from home because she feared for her life, for her unborn  child and she was without a husband.  At age 7 Ida Mae's mother, Louella,  died and the white family her mother worked for adopted her, strange for  times in the rural south.  Her adoptive mother died leaving her with her paraplegic father, Theodore Belcher and a hired hand.  Ida Mae's love for country music won her a $100.00 cash prize for writing a country western jingle, which is part of the reason she was beaten and raped.  The final  test of 17 year old Ida Mae's stamina comes when Theodore Belcher killed  the 3 men responsible for her rape and was then killed himself.<br />After graduation, Ida Mae is taken to Vermont to live with Theodore's son  Wilbert, for 5 years, then returns home to Georgia. During Ida Mae's life,  you share her resilience, her ability to cling to the positives of life,  her ability to find emotional love.<br />Thornton has shown how to live each hurdle with as much strength and dignity  as the situation will allow.  And she depicted an odd but realistic view of an unusual occurrence in southern living.  I give this book a 3.5 on the RAW Scale.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-06-14
Battle Scar	Imagine being a smart, beautiful, and confident woman who has it all, and then try to imagine your world crumbling at your feet the night that you discover a lump in your breast. This was a reality for Sara Davis the main character in Elaine S. Brown's novel &quot;Secret Songs of Sara.&quot; Sara has it all: a good job, a beautiful body, self-confidence, and a man who loves her. That man's name is Reese and he and Sara are very much in love and they both feel that their love can withstand anything.<br /> One evening while getting dressed for a date with Reese, Sara discovers a lump in her left breast. Her initial reaction is fear, and then once the fear sets in she gets very upset. Sara does not share this discovery with Reese or her family, the only person that she tells is her best friend Val. Val and Sara have basically been friends since birth, and they have no secrets between them.<br /> Once Sara calms down she decides to make a doctor's appointment to get the lump checked out. Due to unforeseen circumstances she cannot see her regular doctor and ends up at a clinic. The clinic then makes her wait additional time before she can be seen. The delay in having the lump looked at is driving her crazy and as a reader you can feel her anxiety as you turn the pages of the book.  After Sara sees the doctor, he decides that a biopsy needs to be performed on her breast. A biopsy is basically a procedure in which tissue is extracted from the body and examined. After this procedure is performed the doctor informs Sara that the lump in her breast needs to be removed, so she has it removed. After this surgery Sara develops complications, as a result of these complications she loses her left breast, and gains an ugly scar. Throughout the book she refers to the scar as her &quot;hollow image.&quot; This scar not only affects her physically, but mentally as well. It basically destroys all of the self-confidence that she once had.<br /> During the surgery and after she loses her breast Sara cuts-off all communication with Reese, giving him lame excuses for her absence. She feels that Reese is so focused on her beauty and perfection that there is no way that he could love her with a horrible scar and a single breast.<br /> &quot;Secret Songs of Sara&quot; is a very emotional book. Though I have not experienced what Sara had gone through, I could feel her emotional pain as I turned the pages of the book. This book also showed how much emphasis that society and women themselves put on their breasts: either they are too big or too small; when they should really be happy that they have healthy breasts. I really enjoyed this book and on the RAW scale, it is a 5.<br />Reviewed by Simoneer breast Sara cuts-off all communication with Reese, giving him lame excuses for her absence. She feels that Reese is so focused on her beauty and perfection that there is no way that he could love her with a horrible scar and a single breast.<br /> &quot;Secret Songs of Sara&quot; is a very emotional book. Though I have not experienced what Sara had gone through, I could feel her emotional pain as I turned the pages of the book.

Nice Compilation of Sensuous Prose & Poetry	Making Love In The Rain (MLITR) by Marlon Green is a sensual  anthology that traipses along the variety of tastes that  sexuality beholds.  Through poetry, short stories and preludes,  Green intertwines words with the metaphor of rain, and most  importantly, making love in the rain.<br />Green disperses poetry and stories in three chapters:  the rain,  the storm and the drizzle.  More than anything, I really enjoyed  the poetry, especially \\"(Early) In The Mornin',\\" \\"Step by Step,\\" <br />\\"Need,\\" \\"(Touch Me) From Afar,\\" \\"What's In A Kiss,\\" and \\"From Me  to You.\\"  The vastness of feelings that permeate from the pieces  in this book is apparent and will be felt by those who read it.   I especially felt wooed by the preludes that follow the opening  of each chapter.  They are so sensuously written that you become  eager to read, to see what the rain has in store for you.<br />I don't think there's one type of person out there who won't  find something wonderful to read in this thick anthology. ...	2001-06-14
Sensual Rain	Sweet, sensual, and erotic are thoughts that immediatly come to mind when discussing Marlon Green's &quot;Making Love in the Rain.&quot; It is a collection of stories, poems, and essays. Some of them are erotic, some cute, and some very touching work. These are selections about lost love, heartbreak, adventure, and self-pleasure just to name a few.  <br />In reading this book the author makes you witness to sexual escapades that you  could not have dream of: sex in public places, sex between multiple partners, and other erotic adventures. But to his credit Marlon Green also writes about the tenderness of making love, and the love that lovers can have for one another. He shows how beautiful sex can be between two people who have completely given themselves to one another.<br /> &quot;Making Love in the Rain&quot; is a beautifully put together book; on the RAW scale I give it a 4.<br />Reviewed by Simone A.

Be The Best &quot;You&quot;	Rashun Jones asks, &quot;how do we change a mindset of self-hatred, hopelessness and helpness?&quot; It's the battle for the minds and Blueprints show you how you can win.<br />This book is a great reference for anyone looking to enhance not only their Human Relation skills but also their mind set. When I think about the word Human Relations I think interacting with people, but that's only part of it; the other is empowerment. How to take a simple sentence like \\"Oh this is too hard I cannot do it,\\" and make it positive by saying \\"I will give myself credit for the progress I have made.&quot;<br />There's so many wonderful quotes in this book to make you feel good about yourself and to show you how to make yourself feel good.  Here's one of my favorites quotes:<br />&quot;When life knocks you down, try to land on your back. Because if you can look up you can get up. Let your reason get you up!&quot; Les Brown (author)<br />A Blueprint is a detailed plan or program of action; appropriately titled, Blueprints: A Way of Life is just that. It starts with your mind. Rashun shows the reader how to use positive thoughts so he or she can a star.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-06-05
Don't Stop Dreaming.	Aside from all the typos in this book it was a good read.

Together Ben and Fina get together and explore a greater love; love of the heart. <br />An excerpt from the Isis Papers I got from the author of Visions Website: &quot;Where there is no vision, the people will perish.&quot; So don't stop dreaming no matter what the dream is.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-06-05

How long must we wait?	This story had no instant drama that would require the writer spend the rest of the book trying to make it right.

Exhausted from emotional commitment they both decide to re-channel their energy; so, they turn to a non threatening arena, the Chat line. But is it?<br />The supporting characters were an excellent additon to the story.<br />Oh!, Do Betty and Drew ever meet?  You won't know the answer until...you read the book.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-05-24
Sex, lies, and drama!!	Chris has issues when it comes to her sexuality. While attracted to women, she beds man after man during her college years at Howard University so that people will not question her sexual preferences. She gets involved with Trey, a man three years her junior biologically and ten years her junior in maturity. After years of trying to make him into the man that her womanizing father never was, Chris ends up pregnant and is made to feel so uncomfortable by Trey's mother that she flees to Memphis, her home town, to have the baby in peace. She makes plans for Trey to follow, even sets up job interviews for him but after he comes down, lands a job, makes arrangements for an apartment, and gets her hopes up, he does a 180 and decides he is not moving down there after all. After one night of raunchy sex with another female, he forgets all about Chris and their baby.<br />That is enough to send Chris over the edge. She is sick of men and sick of ignoring her attraction to women so she puts an ad in the women seeking women personals. She ends up getting &quot;whipped&quot; by her first response, a redneck, older white woman named Carol with a son about the same age as Chris. After three months, Chris finds out that Carol just wanted her &quot;young sex&quot; and was still serious with a black female doctor that she had been seeing for years. Chris is heartbroken after finding out that women can play just as many games as men in the pursuit of &quot;good booty.&quot;<br />To make matters worse, Carol is so determined to get Chris off her back that she tells Chris' parents that Chris is into women. Needless to say, her parents are disappointed, but Chris decides that out is out and calls Trey to tell him that he drove her into the arms of a woman. He couldn't care less.<br />Chris decides to give Gayle a chance. Gayle is a woman that she met the day after she first met Carol but refused to get involved with because Carol had her so strung out. Gayle is extremely religious, the Minister of Music at a church where most of the choir members, deacons, and other members of the congregation are sexing each other down. They go out and get drunk and high together and then praise the Lord in unison on Sunday mornings. Chris, who is neutral when it comes to religion, finds it hypocritical for Gayle to indulge in such behavior so she begins to sabotage Gayle's efforts to attend church. Not only is Gayle a minister, she is also a thief that has been in trouble with the law on numerous occasions and ends up getting Chris involved in her nonsense too. To top it all off, they both need to attend domestic violence counseling because they beat each other for sport quite a bit.<br />Fire and Brimstone is the debut novel of Laurinda D. Brown. I read the book from cover to cover in less than five hours, including breaks. It was a courageous move on the part of the author to undertake such a controversial topic. As a controversial author myself, I can't help but admire that. If E. Lynn Harris and James Earl Hardy can write about bisexual African American men, why can't we have books dealing with bisexual African American women? The answer is &quot;we can&quot; and now &quot;we do.&quot; This book has more drama in it than I have read in a long time and the only reason I can't give it a 5 is because there were several inconsistencies throughout the novel. I think the author should have had it read for continuity before sending to press because they were extremely easy to pick up on.

Faith &amp; God reign in this romance novel!	Always, Now and Forever is a romance novel that shows that the power of  faith and the belief in God can help you withstand any pain and can also  open you up to finding love.<br />Clarye Dawson's life has been full of horrible experiences.  Suffering  from polio since childhood, Clarye has has been taunted and teased, and as a  result, her self-esteem is beyond damaged.  Her self-deprecative ways take  her into three violent and abusive marriages that leave her not wanting to  ever deal with the opposite sex again.  As an adult, Clarye is a successful  novelist, and has the type of lifestyle that many would envy; but despite her  career and material gains, life continues to throw pain and heartache in her  way.  That is, until she meets grocery store magnate, Gavin Elliston, a man  with his own painful past.  Through his belief in God and his unwavering faith,  Gavin helps Clarye realize that she deserves love, and the two begin a relationship  that binds them together through love and faith.  With any great love, situations  ensue, and when tragedy hits home once again, the characters are forced to face  their faith head on in the hopes of coming out of the most tragic pain  imaginable.<br />Always, Now and Forever was a different read for me.  This is the first novel I've  read in which the main female character was not some thin, &quot;perfect&quot; specimen, but  was someone with a physical disability; however, beautiful in her own right.  That  alone made the story an interesting read.  Clarye's journey was a very dramaful one  and brings the reader deeply into the story and her pain.  I found the novel to be  more fiction that romance, and would have liked to have seen a more romantic/sexual  scene between the two main characters, and I say this because Clarye thought so lowly  of herself and her body that it would have been nice to see Gavin showing ALL of her  attention in a nice, drawn out scene.  I'm also a lover of dialogue, and the majority  of this novel is narrative, so I didn't receive the pleasure of hearing what the  characters had to say as much as I would have liked to.<br />Overall, Lipsey has written a very nice debut novel that has wonderful messages about  love, faith and God, and I would check out future works by this author.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-05-24
A wonderful move into MAINSTREAM!	Lilly Crawford is a young wife who has long since forgotten  what it is like to truly live.  Living in a small east Texas  town, Lilly is frantic to leave an abusive marriage.  When the  only person who has ever truly loved her -- her husband's mother  -- passes away, Lilly sets out on her journey to be free of her  husband and her painful past.  On a backroad in Louisiana, Lilly's  car breaks down, and with little to no money, she's desperate to  find something, anything to get her moving forward...enter Adam  Wakefield, a prominent, successful neurosurgeon, who has recently  been carjacked and as a result, has lost his eyesight, whether it's  temporary or permanent still lingers in the air.  By luck, Lilly is  hired as Adam's caregiver, and thus lays the tracks for the thick,  literary treat, &quot;The Turning Point,&quot; by Francis Ray.<br />This novel is beautifully written, and Ray writes vividly, quickly  bringing the reader into the upper-class, luxurious lifestyle of the  Wakefields.  Her description of scenery is vibrant, and the story reads  so smoothly, you quickly flip through the 392-paged novel.<br />I fell in love with the characters, each drawn out realistically.  Not  only is the relationship between Lilly and Adam written in a poignant  and sweet manner, but Ray's subplots (the burgeoning love affair between  Adam's mother and a family friend &amp; Adam's sister's relationship with her  &quot;suspicious&quot; boyfriend) are done in a tight, concise manner, interwoven  wonderfully throughout the main plotline and overall story.<br />The Turning is a beautiful love story, but it's so much more than that.   It's a testament to the human spirit, reminding us that even through the  most horrific circumstances, with love and faith, we can overcome and  shine brightly.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-05-24
A Beautiful...Exquisite Novel...a MUST-HAVE!	SUGAR is one of the most engrossing novels that I have read in a long time.  McFadden weaves a tale so vividly, the reader is easily transported into the storyline.<br />1940, Bigelow, Arkansas is where this Southern tale begins, with a scene so disturbingly painful and detailed that it grips your heart and propels you to read further.  SUGAR's opening line, JUDE IS DEAD, is powerful, and we learn that Pearl and Joe Taylor have lost their only daughter Jude to a horrific event, and Pearl, a once vibrant, loving wife and mother, finds herself devastated over the loss, a piece of her soul, her heart gone forever.<br />Move to 1955, where life in Bigelow seems to be normal, and Pearl has buried the pain of Jude's death deep within her.  That is, until a scandalously sexy and provocative woman waltzes into their small town, right next door to Pearl, creating rumors and upheavals with the women and gawking and lust with the men.  Pearl is struck by the resemblance that Sugar has to her deceased child.  Pearl and Sugar have their own personal demons that have plagued them, and this connection sparks a friendship between the odd couple.  Through their friendship, and the unfolding of their painful paths, the women become more family than friends, but all is not glorious as the past looms over them, bringing pain, grief, and the reopening of old wounds.<br />McFadden writes with such beauty that it's easy to get lost in the novel.  The plot is full of drama and realism of the time period and will invoke anger and despair, hope and forgiveness in those who read it.  The town, the people, the dialogue is so vivid, so realistic, that it's easy to believe every account in the novel, even the truly painful.<br />SUGAR is an exquisite piece of literature, and it's definitely deserving of being on every reader's bookshelf.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-05-24

A Hip, Fun Read!	Maryann Reid's first novel, &quot;Sex &amp; The Single Sister&quot; (STSS) has been compared to Candace Bushnell's bestseller, &quot;Sex &amp; The City.&quot;  Just about every group I belong to has brought the title up in some  setting, and as a single sister, I knew I had to read Ms. Reid's  book to see if I could find just a little bit of myself within the  pages.<br />STSS is a compilation of five short stories about five single and  upwardly mobile sisters and their experiences with men, dating,  and sex.  STSS brings us:<br />--FARAH, a 24-year-old sister from Brooklyn, who considers herself a  free spirit, who is looking, but enjoying while she looks.  She finds  herself catching feelings in a situation that involves a man who is  already &quot;committed&quot;.<br />--ALAYA, a 26-year-old from San Francisco whose major asset is her  voluptuous body.  She has problems with letting men in, and when she  finds someone she could learn to love, she questions herself...and him.<br />--KENYA, a 29-year-old from Miami is suffering from the &quot;can't find a  man&quot; blues.  She meets a sexy Hispanic man and falls into a relationship  with him...but all ain't perfect, when she begins to wonder what else is  out there, and find herself checking out other prospects.<br />--ALEXIS, a 25-year-old from Atlanta who has just gotten out of a long  relationship and has the urge to explore her &quot;other&quot; side.<br />--WACEERA, a 23-year-old from Chicago is attached, but is still checking  out the scene looking for the best man.<br />Reid's style is very light and entertaining.  She gives the reader five  distinct scenarios that I'm sure women (black and white and others) may  have found themselves in...even though they might deny it!<br />The stories are fast-paced as you get caught up in the characters' dramas  of career and men.  Reid has a way of bringing the reader directly into  the scenes of each story, and I found myself shaking me head, laughing or  cussing out the girls for their antics.  One thing I will say, the word SEX  in the title ain't just there for show!  This book gets down sexually speaking  and delivers some wickedly sexual scenes...but all done within the context  of the stories...not just for the purpose of having sex in a story.<br />I think all women, especially those who have lived through the decade of the 20s or who are living it now, will find something entertaining and fun to read with Sex &amp; The Single Sister.t the girls for their antics.

Overcoming Obstacles	Imagine your husband of twenty years coming home from the office one evening and plopping a baby carrier down in front of you. Imagine him telling you that you have to take care of the baby he made with another woman and that his word is law. Imagine being torn because you've never been able to produce a child and now, at the age of forty, you finally have the opportunity to nurture and love a child. An innocent child who didn't choose to enter this world as the byproduct of an affair between a famous African-American politician and a cocaine addict. Such is the dilemma of Vivian, married to Walter, a man who thinks he can walk on water and do whatever he likes no matter the consequences. <br />Walter brings the baby girl Passion home, never changes a diaper, never fixes a bottle, never even holds her. Vivian, a third year law student, has to end up missing more than a week of class because Walter won't allow an English-speaking sitter in the home to protect himself from scandal. Walter invites Vivian to a function and insists that she bring the baby only to throw her in front of reporters at a press conference to announce their loving adoption of a needy child.<br />After Vivian returns to school, she is approached by a journalism professor, Marc, who is doing extensive research on adoption. Vivian avoids all his questions but she cannot avoid the immediate attraction between them. Neither can Marc and he shows up day after day to take her out to lunch. During those daily lunches, romance is born and Vivian decides that she has had enough of Walter. Of course, like most men of power, Walter can't handle it and his competitive, determined side emerges. <br />The Price of Passion was surprisingly a very good book. While not generally a fan of romance novels, this one held my attention. The storyline was for the most part predictable but there was a slight surprise near the end. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone that likes to see women overcome obstacles and carry on.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-05-24

Sizzling!!!!!	Hot! Hot! Hot! are the words that I would use to describe Nelson George's latest novel &quot;Show &amp; Tell.&quot; Dean Chance, the main character is a pretty conservative guy. He produces segments for the &quot;Nick Shaw Show.&quot; The show is your run of the mill talk show based in the very competitive New York market. One day the powers that be decide that the show needs a new focus, sex. Little does Dean know that this new focus will not only affect him but also the people closest to him. People he thinks he knows, he really doesn't know at all.<br />Dean has a devoted and steady girlfriend named Millie Jackson. Millie and Dean have a very good relationship with a very healthy sex life. The only real issue that Dean has with Millie is that she seems to be so career focused.  By chance one day Dean meets a woman named Bee Cole, a beautiful, mysterious, and seductive woman. Bee brings out things in Dean that he wasn't even aware of.<br /> &quot;Show &amp; Tell&quot; is not only a love story, but an exploration of sexuality. The book explores many aspects of the act of sex and sexual fantasies.  It was a page turner and I could not put this book down. This book is erotic and exotic and on the RAW scale I give it a 5.<br />Reviewed by Simone	2001-05-24
When do you stop living?	Ava Johnson left Idlewild, Michigan, in search of whatever people leave home in search of. She just knew that what she was looking for was not in this small town 40 miles north of Detroit.<br />Not liking Detroit,  she moved to Atlanta, Georgia and was enjoying a lucrative Hair Salon business.  Things were going good for Ava, she had yet to  meet the  love of her life but had finally decided she was tired of dry runs, and had been celibate for a year.  Then life reared it's ugly head;  Ava tested positive  for HIV.  Having absolutely no idea of whom, when or where, she informed ALL of her former lovers.<br />When an irate wife stormed Ava's salon wanting  to know why she wrote her husband and demanding she take back what she wrote,  Ava knew it was time to close shop and move on.

Her plans were to spend a couple of months at home and then move to Calfornia to await the inevitable after all, she already  knew her fate.<br />Ava had been in Idlewild less than a week before she was knee deep in all of the goings on AND exposed to an emotion that had eluded her all her life.  She couldn't believe she had left all those years ago, in search of something that was right in her backyard.  No, she thought, couldn't be, especially not  now, this is just too crazy.<br />Cleage used this wonderful vehicle to share with us a tragic situation handled in a very passionate and realistic way to say that there is a lot of living  left whatever the situation, if we would just live it.  And more importantly,  to show Ava that what looks like crazy... could just possibly be love.<br />Reviewed by aNN	2001-05-24
LESSONS IN SHARING LOVE, ALWAYS	After reading the back cover of Luvalwayz,  I expected to read three separate short stories about 3 different couples, what I got was a connected treat. This  is one story written in 3 parts, about 3 young women best friends for life, and  3 guys super tight from college days.  Each group refers to themselves as the  three musketeers.<br />Part 1, Christopher and Tamara &quot;Tee&quot; met in the park, once he mustered up enough nerve to introduce himself.

And as they tossed their hat into the literary arena, they will  undobutedly be a force that the literary world will have to reckon with.<br />Reviewed by aNNllent  introduction to the debut authors.

It's a Family Affair!	Once Upon A Family Tree is a raw, gritty and dramatic look at one family's eventful life in the Big Apple.  The storyline truly grabs you from page one and takes you on a whirlwind rollercoaster ride.<br />Hi, My name is Yolara Burkett.  I am only 18 years old and until a moment ago the only concern I had was how I was going to afford college.  Now it seems all hell has broken loose.  My Dad's wife Olive, and daughter Egypt, just found out that he has another family, which includes me.  They're just jealous because I'm the Love Child.  My Dad, Meshach Burkett, is a bus driver and he met my Mom, Caridad Flores, when she was a teenager.  Well she was almost grown, as she was a high school senior when they met.  It was lust... oh I mean love...at first sight and a couple of years later I was born. Dad having two families seemed to work fine, until Mom decided she wanted to be the only woman in my father's life.  Since my Dad wouldn't leave his wife, several years ago, my Mom decided to leave him.  She proceeded to have a one-night stand with a teenager by the name of Kaliq and now today they have a set of 5-year-old twins.  In the meantime, Dad's marriage has disintegrated and he's decided that he wants to get back with my mom.  Mom ain't hearing it 'cause her girlfriend Rue is trying to brush up on her.  And then there's me.... I think I like my mama's babies daddy, Kaliq.  After all at age 23 he's closer in age to me than he ever was to her and she doesn't really want him.  I wonder if she would get jealous if I decide to let him talk to me. Wow, with all this family drama going on-and this ain't even half of it---what's a girl to do?<br />Once Upon a Family Tree is an entertaining and intriguing novel from newcomer Michelle DeLeon.  The storyline is filled with much drama and &quot;twisted&quot; plot turns and events.  The storyline moves quickly and is an easy read.  I liked how the author bridged the worlds of the young adults with the older adults; this gave the book a mature feel so that those over age 30 will also enjoy this book.  At times, some of the scenes might appear a little farfetched and over the top, however, this added to the originality and uniqueness of this book and showed the author's ability to think outside of the box.  One pet peeve I had was that some of the details regarding very common topics were lacking and as such the topics didn't appear to be researched very well (i.e. bi-annual pap smears, renter's insurance).  With this aside, overall, I really liked this book and recommend it to those who enjoy storylines with much drama and truly colorful characters.<br />Reviewed by Yasminbook a mature feel so that those over age 30 will also enjoy this book.

My Best Book of 2001...great SEQUEL!	First off, I have to say, I have not and probably will not read a book this year that is as gripping and thick and suspenseful  and deep as Tananarive Due's sequel to &quot;My Soul to Keep&quot; -- THE  LIVING BLOOD.<br />For those who have read &quot;My Soul to Keep&quot; (and if you haven't,  RUN to get it), THE LIVING BLOOD begins five years after the  death of David/Dawit, Jessica's husband.  Jessica has moved to  Africa, along with her sister and three-year-old daughter.  To  aid in closing the lid of a painful past, Jessica focuses on  running a clinic that miraculously assists in the curing of  extremely ill children.  But it's not that easy for Jessica to  forget her past, for it lives within her, in her blood...and in  her young daughter's, who has powers well beyond any living person ...mortal or immortal.  Jessica's daughter is the first child to be  born with the living blood, and this fact does not sit well with the  immortals who dwell the Earth...immortals who have lived hundreds of  years, and would want nothing more than to see the prodigal child  terminated.  Jessica's child can be the key to revealing the immortals  to the real world...either sparking a union or battle that may destroy  civilization.<br />I don't think I could write a review that adequately displays my joy  in reading this book.  The 500 plus pages of the novel initially daunted  me, but the ease in which Due writes makes for a voraciously fast-paced  read.  The characters jump off the page, and the descriptions of the  settings are so vivid.  Due writes this unique story so well, that you  almost ask yourself if what she's writing about is real...that's some  great fiction.<br />I adored this novel and the breadth of which Due wrote it.  It's a DEFINITE  must have on every book shelf.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-05-22
Each One Teach One	Before picking this book up to read  I was aware of the knowledge I needed on  African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years.  It amazes me how we were not taught any of our  history not even in college. It also  amazes me how people got away with not educating us.<br />Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system  was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson &quot;Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required.&quot; To this day they are still using the same system but I  think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-05-22

There is tragedy, comedy, and pain all wrapped up in this debut novel. On the RAW scale this book is a 4.<br />Reviewed by Simone	2001-05-22
Beyond the Relationship Drama	My first thought about this books was, this is a mature story.  A refreshing change from stories about relationships, excess  baggage, or abuse.  It is a well written story about life.  It is told by three individuals whose lives were intertwined.<br />Moxie has not accepted her mother's suicide death, which happened over 25 years ago, and she has suffered guilt that only an 11 year  old child can imagine. Her failure to release the shadows of her  past, affected her marriage and is causing problems with her 15  year old daughter, Zadi.  As a counselor for troubled teens, Moxie's  job is to listen and make recommendations to her clients.  But she  does not take this skill home, she tends to direct, with too firm  a  hand, the course Zadi's life will take.  She fails to really  listen to her daughter so they don't communicate.  To complicate  matters, Moxie suffers with bouts of depression and wonders if  history will repeat itself.<br />Her best friend Norma has been her link to reality, forever.  When  Norma's  daughter  is 'stillborn' and her husbands goes into himself  to grieve,  Norma has to share her emotional lost with Moxie.  Norma floats in a haze for  months looking for some semblance of  stability and meaning to her life. I would love to have known Norma  better, as some of her actions were not clear to me.  When she shares  a secret with Moxie about how she is coping, Moxie's disapproval  causes the bond between them to unravel in an unexpected way.<br />Zadi, Moxie's daughter, is a typically spoiled middle-class teenager  and the reader hears her story through daily entries in her diary.  Zadi's diary entries give you a very real look at what teenagers  think and how they communicate, the essence of the story was  told through Zadi.  At 15, she definitely had her own agenda and she  resented her mother's interference.  She constantly pits her parents  against each other, but finds herself entangled in her lies.<br />Patricia Elam's debut novel is a wonderfully written story about  humanity, with the message being everything is determined by our  attitude and our resolve.  The main characters struggled to deal with  the  disappointments  and contradictions that tend to drag the very  essence of life from your soul.  This book was breathtakingly honest,  and it exposed Ms Elam as a natural storyteller.  Hopefully this is  just the first, of a long list of titles from this talented new author.wonderfully written story about  humanity, with the message being everything is determined by our  attitude and our resolve.

Romance, Drama, and Mystery	If you are a romantic at heart, then this book was written just for  you. Intimate Intentions by Angie Daniels is a wonderful story with a  mixture of romance, steamy drama, mystery and intrigue all in one  incredibly written book. Ms. Daniels not only outdid herself with the  story line, she has redefined the romance novel. I was unable to put  the book down after reading the first page. Intimate Intentions not  only holds your interest until the very last page, you are drawn into solving the mystery, and cheering for the lead characters until the  very end of the book.<br />Meet Sasha Moore, a model that has finally called it quits until she  is turned down for a loan to start her own wedding designer business.

She soon learns there  is more to modeling for Diva Designs when she meets their CEO,  Terraine Andrews. Together with two unsolved murders of models  associated with Diva Designs along with finding out that her ex- boyfriend Robby, who traumatized her in the past, has recently been  released from a mental hospital; she realizes that she is in the midst  of a stormy discovery of self and the people around her, including the  killer.<br />Meet Terraine Andrews, CEO of Diva Designs, who is forced to return  to run the business after his grandfather passes away. Even though he  never saw eye to eye with his grandfather, he feels a deep obligation  to continue the showcase success of Diva Designs his grandfather  built. Unfortunately, when two of his models are murdered one by one,  he has much more facing him than the continued success of the  business. Not only must he find out who the killer is before more  innocent people are murdered, he must also deal with a welcomed  romantic awakening with Sasha and realize that he must protect her at  all costs.<br />Adding to the saga is Honey, Sasha's best friend and roommate, who  has everyone believing she is so together, when in reality she is in  denial of tragic events in the past that has hindered her desire for  commitment. Jay Andrews, Terraine's brother, is a private  investigator who plays a prominent role in helping solve the mystery  surrounding the deaths of the models. Jay also realizes there is more  to his feelings toward Honey than being a good friend. Natalie, fashion<br />director of Diva Designs, has only one agenda, to marry Terraine, who she has tried to deceive in the past. Then there is Robby, recently released from a mental hospital, who still harbors an obsession for his ex-girlfriend, Sasha. They, along with other characters in the book, makes this story line a wonderful page turner.  Finally, the icing on the cake, if you will, is the mystery  surrounding the identity of the killer. You won't be disappointed.  Ms. Daniels wraps it up with a very intense, descriptive ending that  will lead you to wondering if there will be a sequel. I highly  recommend this book and give it a rating of 5.<br />Reviewed by Kalaaniis Honey, Sasha's best friend and roommate, who  has everyone believing she is so together, when in reality she is in  denial of tragic events in the past that has hindered her desire for  commitment.

Beautifully Written Debut Novel!!	Six Days in January opens just as William McCall is being dumped for the  &quot;final&quot; time by his girlfriend Della.  Confused and hurt, William decides  to use this time to reflect upon his life and figure out how he came to be  the type of man that would string a woman along and break her heart.  His  self-reflection takes him on a journey that begins over a decade ago, when  he met the one woman who would become the love of his life.  Growing up,  William was taught by his single mother how to be a sensitive, strong and  caring black man, but in regards to relationships, no woman has wanted to deal  with him.  They see him as too sweet and too soft, and a few women have even  questioned his sexual preference.  When he meets Andrea, William thinks that  he has finally met the woman of his dreams, but she belongs to another, and  in the end she leaves William to pick up the pieces of his broken heart.  The  pain from that relationship has been carried inside him for over a decade,  and it has damaged him from opening up his life to any woman.  As he spends  the next six days evaluating his life and trying to finally say goodbye to  old demons, will it be too late to receive the love of someone he's hurt?<br />Six Days in January is a beautifully written novel.  It's extremely rare to  find a novel that speaks to the pain and the hurt of a black man as he goes  through life trying to find someone to love.  I cried when the main character  cried, and I smiled and hoped when things looked promising.  The novel is an  emotional rollercoaster that will leave you questioning your own views on love  and relationships.  I could only hope that from this book people may realize  that the one you love might be the one you bypass because he or she doesn't fit  a particular &quot;mold.&quot;  I applaud Cooper for having the talent and the bravery to  paint such a vivid story for public consumption, and can't wait to read more from  this new author.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-05-21

I look forward to the next two in the series. After reading an excerpt of #2 it promises to be just as intriguing.<br />Reviewed by Missy	2001-05-21
Giving Birth Doesn't Make You A Mother	^5 for Parry Brown, I just loved this book. Parry &quot;Ebony Satin&quot; Brown's purpose  for writing this book and I quote was &quot;For all the brothas who do the right thing even when no one is watching.&quot;<br />This was a fantastic book..... Terry Winston, father of twin girls finds himself in a horrible custody battle with their mother, Catherine who gave birth to the twins 10 yrs earlier and called Terry from her hospital bed telling him if he wanted the twins he needed to get there quickly or she would be signing the adoption papers. Terry, head over heels for Catherine, rushes to the hospital to stake a claim on his girls.<br />Now, after 10 years, he cannot understand why Catherine wants joint custody of the twins. He knows she doesn't love them or want them, so he thinks she's doing it to get even with him.<br />Catherine Hawkins decides she needs a larger piece of the corporate pie. She thinks that in order to get it, she needs to look like an All American Mom. Doing what she has to to ensure she wins the custoday battle, she tries digging a wedge between the twins.<br />If I had to choose my favorite characters it would be the twins, Ariana and Alisa. Their characters are so like many children today. Small but with a lot of  voice and opinions. This book was not only about a father's fight to keep his daughters, it was also about the genuine love amongst friends who have grown into a family.<br />Excellent characters and story....I cannot wait to read Sexy Doesn't Have A Dress Size.<br />Missy	2001-05-18

It is a powerhouse of information that any writer can benefit from. From tips on writing and submitting book proposals, query letters, and manuscripts to advice on locating and obtaining an agent to interviews with some of the top people in the business, you can walk away with a ton of knowledge that will help you push your writing career forward.<br />The AA Writers Handbook can save you dozens of hours of research because everything you need to know is comprised in this one gem of a book. While there are a ton of writing handbooks, it is a breath of fresh air to see one completely dedicated to the plight of AA authors. This book should definitely be included on the reference shelf of any writer serious about their craft.	2001-05-18
A Wonderful Multi-Layered Novel!	A beautiful home...a handsome mate...an adorable child...these  things should equal happily ever after, right?  In Darlene  Johnson's novel, &quot;Dream in Color&quot; the main character - Victoria  Chandler - realizes that all is not golden in her picture-perfect  life, even if her mother insists that it is.<br />When Victoria becomes pregnant, Gerald does &quot;right&quot; by Victoria by  marrying her, but he lets it be known that this is just for his  daughter, not because he loves her, and throughout their years of  marriage, Victoria is stripped of her self-esteem and of her dreams  for the life she always wanted to have.<br />That is until she awakens in her dreams to meet James and Michael  Prince, two completely different men who aid Victoria in coming to  terms with the realization of her damaged marriage, and at the same  time, invoke all her wishes and dreams to be brought into the light  of reality.  Each of these dream men have their own emotional baggage  to carry, but Victoria finds herself so immersed into her dream lives,  that it's hard to decipher what's real and what's merely a dream.<br />This book is great, and I was hooked on page one.  There are so many  twists and turns to the storyline, that the reader can't help but to  flip through the pages, anxious to see what happens next.  Johnson  does a seamless job in weaving dream life into reality by using both  first person and third person to unfold the reality and dream drama,  respectively.<br />Every emotion imaginable is brought forth in this novel, and the theme  of loving yourself is so poignant, that every reader will be able to tap  into it and realize that in the end, we must love ourselves or we can't  possibly have love to give to others...or to expect others to LOVE us.<br />Shonie	2001-05-18
KLR Does It Again...GREAT novel!	Sydney, Gina and Rick are siblings with a very tight bond, despite  their unique characteristics:  Sydney is the eldest and more  responsible, Gina is the middle child, high in her career yet too  proud to acknowledge some glaring mistakes in her life, and Rick  is the baby and hasn't learn the word COMMITMENT yet.<br />When the matriarch of their family, Delores is stricken down with  a stroke, the three must come together in a way they never have  before.  The responsibility of taking care of an ill parent pits  the siblings against each other, and as the tumultuous obstacles of  their individual lives culminate, the question becomes, will the  siblings ever be able to reconnect like they once had?<br />This was an excellent read.  I've thoroughly enjoyed Roby's novels in  the past, and this one connected with me on a more personal level.   The storyline of the strickened parent rang so realistically in the novel,  that you find yourself pulling out the tissues to share in the pain of the  children.  For anyone that has taken care of an ill loved one, this novel  will provoke many emotions for you.  The individual obstacles that the  siblings faced -- sexual abuse, domestic abuse to name a few -- were told  in a touching and frighteningly true-to-life manner.<br />Roby weaves through the various plotlines with ease, and her dialogue is  tight, description and action painfully vivid.  With three bestsellers  under her belt, IT'S A THIN LINE is sure to be her fourth consecutive hit. ...	2001-05-18

The underside of New Orleans	The Family Curse sets an eerie scenario from the opening chapter, you start with the feeling that someone needs protection from an unknown power.  This story is set in New Orleans, which is a perfect backdrop for a battle of good versus evil.  Freda's fair skin and blue eyes afforded her many privileges in  her hometown of Morgan City, Louisiana.  She steals her sister's boyfriend and  leaves home to never return.<br />Ms Breaux did a superb job of presenting the life  of Freda and Raymond Marshall, from their initial meeting, Ray is mesmerized by  the fair complexion and the beauty of Freda.  While Margaret is trying to get  to Ray's heart through his stomach, Freda takes a more southern route.  And  with a little help,  six months later, Ray and Freda are married and her  sister moves to New York City. The sisters meet again  some 20 years  later when they return to New Orleans for a visit.  Both of her sisters are  very successful, but Freda has yet to learn how to read, and the beauty she  once possessed has faded.  Ray is still with her, he has developed a roving  eye, but he will not leave or, he cannot leave.  There was a curse following  Ray and Freda and they didn't know how to break it.  Their union produced three  sons and one daughter Delores, who could not find a peaceful existence and could  not find love,  but there was a reason for that.<br />This story had so many  twists and turns, and just when you think you have it figured out, something else happens and you realize you don't.  You are introduced to spirits,  incantations, conjures and witch craft with a good sprinkling of the erotic.  Though the ending was not climatic it cleared all issues and you were genuinely  surprised.<br />Ms Breaux has the makings of a wonderful story teller, she dangled enough loose ends to keep you intrigued, and then tied them in a very neat package.  This  was a very different, but very delightful read, about the underside of New<br />Orleans.<br />Reviewed by aNNy aNN	2001-05-18
Exceptional Portrayal of Slavery Times	Charles Johnson, previous winner of The National Book Award for Middle Passage, does a wonderful job of creating 12 fictional stories based on slavery times. He jumps in and out of the voices of everyone from a scared little boy being transported to America on a slave ship, having to witness his parents and sibling die, to Frederick Douglas, Phyllis Wheatley and even Martha Washington during the time she is trying to cope with her husband's death.<br />This book is innovative and creative and it gives great insight into a time that a lot of people would prefer to forget. Soulcatcher, the title story, is about an escaped slave being hunted by a bounty hunter for a $200 reward. There is another story about people trying to convince blacks to return to Africa after they are given their freedom and have outworn their welcome. It is amazing to think that people, our people, ever lived that way. While disturbing to even imagine it, this is a must read for those of us that take simple liberties for granted on a daily basis.<br />Reviewed by Zane	2001-05-18
What Do Men Want?	Baggage Check had nothing to do with suitcases, and traveling, it had everything to do with examining the  thoughts, feelings and  behavior  that greatly affect a relationship.  This is a well written story about  why men do some of the non-commital things  they do in the name of  having a good time.  You don't just glimpse the workings of their mind,  you are actually taken on a journey with 3 experienced players.  You  share their collective pasts (baggage), that have made them react to  women in the manner we are shown.  Julian, Larry and Gregrory share so  many escapades that you get lost in their shuffle, but when a life  threatening event slows them down, they begin to assess their lives and  to check their baggage.<br />Julian, thinks he's one of God's gift to women;  his rules clearly state: no long distant love and no ready made family.  A role reversing  event put him on the short end of the stick, and he didn't like the  feeling.<br />Larry is just a cold lover, doesn't really have an agenda, plays  everything on the fly. Hollywood is the perfect setting for his game  and the plethora of women was his prize.  But just when he wasn't  looking, he was blinded by 'The Light'.<br />Gregory the only one in a serious relationship,  was losing it all  behind the old OJay's song 'For The Love Of Money', when what he needed  to do was make an emotional deposit, because that's where his account  was short.<br />Now the strength of the story was how the guys interacted and committed  to each other.  They shared what we would call a sista girl friendship;  they talked on the 3 way once a month, bragging and sharing stories.  Their friendship and their realness with each other is what made them  nice guys who just needed to check themselves.<br />Bunn has penned a  sensitive book, exposing a side of the male psyche that we rarely see.  He is a story teller that will undoubtedly make his X on the literary scene.<br />aNN Brown, RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2001-05-18
A Good Read....Really a 3.5 Rating	Jamaica and Canada are the backdrop of the thirteen short stories contained in author Bernadette Dyer's &quot;Villa Fair.&quot; The characters in the book are of various ethnic backgrounds and classes.<br />  Of the thirteen stories in the book there were two that stood out in my opinion. These two stories are entitled &quot;Driving Through Red Lights&quot; and &quot;Roberta on the Beach.&quot;<br />  &quot;Driving Through Red Lights is about Kamla, the child of Hindu Indians who have immigrated to Canada. Kamla was born and raised in Canada therefore she know more of the western culture than she does of her Hindu heritage. This is something that causes her parents great stress. Tradition states that women should marry fairly young, so at twenty-three Kamla is considered an embarassment and disappointment to her family. Tradition also states that the marriage must be arranged.<br />  One day Kamla's aunt Rashna comes to visit from Bombay, India and she announces that she has found someone to marry Kamla. Kamla's husband-to-be, a future doctor, is named Lachman Ramsingh. He will come to Canada in two months to claim his bride and take her back to India. She does not want any of this, she wants to marry for love and live in Canada. The many twists, turns, and emotions make this a very enjoyable and touching story.

Computer + Love, with an adventurous twist!	Jonathan C. Evans (JC) is a man who is ridiculed for being a major  computer nerd, whether it's from the dockers and white shirts he  wears daily, or his obsession with being logical.  Jasmine Banks has  been a friend of JC's and after his break up from his girlfriend, her  feelings for him begin to surface, but she's rebuffed by JC's logical  ways and assurance that he's not interested in anything that deals with  human emotions.  Jasmine is determined to prove to JC that logic needs  to be thrown out the window when love and feelings are concerned.  JC's  wires cross and he finds himself catching feelings for Jasmine.  Jasmine  gets more than she bargains for when the dockers and computers are pushed  aside and the real JC Evans emerges.<br />I found THE RIGHT CODE to be very humorous and it was interesting how Holmes  was able to weave computer terminology throughout the story to reflect the  male main character's &quot;logical&quot; feelings and hang ups with being logical, it  was definitely unique.  However, on the flipside of that coin, I found myself  tired of seeing the words &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;illogical&quot; and felt that at times I  was being browbeat into realizing the character was very straight-laced,  uniformed and technical, basically devoid of feelings.<br />Also, I like seeing characters that jump off the page at you, and I didn't  feel that way with many of the characters in this novel.  I almost wanted to  see this novel twice its size, so that the characters could be more fleshed  out, and the backstories of these characters more revealed so that I could  believe many of the situations that arose in the novel.  I found the character  JC to be wonderfully intricate, but the character Jasmine I would have liked to  have seen more of her personality and her backstory brought to light, so that I  could see the character more, and believe the love between her and JC more.<br />All in all, the plot of THE RIGHT CODE is a great one, and ina small book, a  lot of action occurs to make this novel a fast read.<br />Shonie	2001-05-18
Fighting the fight in Corporate America.	The title Working In The Dark, had me curious as to where this story was  going to take me.  The inference was to how so many people spend a lifetime working, without a real goal or destination in mind.<br />The main character, Charvette Lee, is an African American woman, many of us  can relate to.  She is the vehicle used to show some of the underhanded  activities that are part of corporate America. The writer goes a step   further as she zeros in on women in the corporate world and how petty we  can be.  Char, is trying to become the first Black woman with a management  position, in the prestigious communication company where she works, but the  second in command, Daven has other ideas.  Char is having a problem dealing with the back-biting and the unscrupulous sex that's a part of office  politics.  Because she is  Black, is a classy dresser and has a degree, her co-workers are jealous. And sadly enough much of the conflict Char was  dealing with was black on black conflict.  Char's goal is to get the company  to fund some training which will make her more marketable, Daven's goal is to  get Char to train other employees, she then plans to terminate Char and give  the position to her 'girl'.<br />Char is stressed because she knows about Daven's plan and she has to protect her job without appearing uncooperative within the office structure.  She has  ended an unsatisfying relationship, because her boyfriend is never there when  she needs him.<br />Now the premise of the story was great, it's a view that should definitely  be shown, however, I had issues with the presentation.  The characters  seemed to be thinly coated, they were not personable to me, there was never  the feeling that I knew them. Also, the intent I think was to show when  things are not good, we should let go and let God. But the actions of the  characters were not in line with Godliness. My last issue is this, there  was a destructive secret concerning Daven which Charvette discovered,  but thediscovery had no bearing on the story.<br />Ms Nathane, definitely had a story to be told, and the subject is an  excellent topic which shed great insight into how negative forces can be so  dominant in the coporate world. She has taken a positive step towards  obtaining her literary dreams.<br />Reviewed by aNN Brown	2001-05-18
Positive and Inspiring	Inner strength is something that gets us through our darkest hours and days, and faith is at the core of this strength. In Dr. Joye M. Carter's  autobiography &quot;My Strength Comes from Within&quot; she shows how her inner strength and faith led her to achieving her goals. Dr. Carter is the first black female to become a Chief Medical Examiner in the United States. She first held this position in Washington , D.C. and is presently employed as the Chief Medical Examiner for Harris County, Texas.<br />  Dr. Carter details the very rough road that she had to take to gain the title of Chief Medical Examiner. Growing up and throughout her schooling when she told others that she wanted to be a forensic pathologist, they ridiculed her or told her that she would never be able to do it. Fortunately Dr. Carter realized that it really did not matter what other people said or thought, what mattered is that she believed in herself and God, and with these beliefs anything is possible.<br />  Dr. Carter's job as a Medical Examiner exposes her to death on a daily basis, in her career she has seen the results of what has happened to people when they hit her examining table. Even though her patients are dead, she takes her time with them and she treats them with respect and dignity. Dr. Carter's strong faith guides her through her job daily.<br /> &quot;My Strength Comes from Within&quot; is a very positive and inspiring book. It gives the reader inspiration and a guide to achieving his or her dreams or goals. The only real issue that I had with the book is that several words and  phrases seemed too be overused. A good example would be Dr. Carter's title of Chief Medical Examiner, it is basically on every page of the book and I felt that was a little much. Otherwise I enjoyed the book and gave it a RAW rating of 3.5.<br />Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks	2001-05-18
Wonderful Mystery Novel!	Have you ever begin reading a book and all of a sudden realize you can't put it down? Welcome to the club. Silent Suspicion: A Lincoln Keller Mystery, by Lee E. Meadows will definitely keep you from putting this book down. Mr. Meadows has done it again. &quot;Silent Suspicion&quot; goes beyond being a must read; it takes you totally by surprise with much suspense and intrigue as Mr. Meadows has so skillfully done in his latest book.<br />Lincoln Keller or Linc as he is called by most is hired by Judge &quot;War Zone&quot; Henderson to investigate the murder of his sister-in-law,  Deborah Norris. A freelance journalist, Deborah was described as being a free spirit, prankster, and caring person. Unfortunately, eight years ago brought Deborah's intriguing journalism career to an end. Although her unsolved murder is assumed to be robbery motivated, Judge Henderson feels that there is more to his wife's sister's death. <br />Recommended to Judge Henderson by Lincoln's brother Jeff, the<br />mysterious bounty hunter, he reluctantly takes the case. The  mystery begins. From the very start of his investigation, Linc begins meeting people that become directly and indirectly involved in Deborah's murder which also includes another unsolved traffic accident that has taken the life of two teenagers coming home from their high school prom, also eight years ago. His investigation takes him to Winston, who now lives in Deborah's former apartment and was once her secret lover, to her two friends, Sharron, who idolized and took Deborah's death very hard and is now Winston's love interest, to MiShaun who envied, admired and relied on Deborah's strength in helping her face her battle with alcoholism. MiShaun, who would do anything to get ahead, becomes a major player in the mystery surrounding her friend's murder. Lincoln's twists and turns investigation takes him to Trevor Stallings, looking to become mayor of Detroit one day by starting with a seat on the city council to his brother, Pernell Stallings, who is a time bomb kept in check by his brother, to other characters making this story one that literally keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br />You become absorbed in trying to figure out along with Lincoln how this basketful of characters all fit in the puzzle of Deborah's murder. What you will find is another amazing mystery novel that Mr. Meadows has so craftily put together. What stands out also in this story is the Keller family members, their various personalities, and undying willingness to help brother Linc at a moment's notice. The twists, turns and overall dynamics of the story line are wonderful. I will also interject that the ending and I mean the actual ending will  put tears in your eyes to the point of eagerly waiting for his  next novel. Mr. Meadows has indeed done it again.<br />Reviewed by Kalaani	2001-05-18
Beautiful Story of Love	Have you ever wondered about things like love between a man and a woman, a father's love for a child, or modern positions for making love? In the book &quot;The Second Peoples: The Beginning,&quot; those questions and more are answered. The  two main characters are Umfazi and Anbessa. Anbessa's name is Amharic and means lion, and Umfazi's name is Zulu word for woman. It should be noted that the names used in this book are real names or are derived from  real names.  Umfazi, a very young woman is about to give birth to her first child. She is alone and afraid, she has just lost her entire family and tribe in a horrible fire. As the book opens she is hanging in s tree and is experiencing some very painful contractions.  Anbessa, a young man who has witnessed fire and smoke coming from a mountain has ventured away from the safety and security of his tribe to find out where the fire is coming from. During Anbessa's travels he hears moans coming from the direction of a tree and at first he thinks it might be an animal, but upon  further inspection he sees Umfazi. She is obviously about to give birth. At first Anbessa just watches Umfazi but she is in so much pain that he decides to help her.<br /> This is a highly unusual action for a male to take, a man witnessing the birth of a child let alone assisting in that birth because it is considered offensive  to the spirits. Men were never around women during birth or when they had their  monthly cycle. The birth of Caraga, Umfazi's daughter, is the first of many different or unnatural circumstances that happened in this book.<br /> Anbessa and Umfazi are two people alone in the wilderness, with a newborn baby, battling the elements and wild animals. They often are forced to move from place to place in seach of shelter, safety, food, and clean drinking water.<br /> During their travels they do some things that are definetly considered different. One of those things is that they fall in love. This is highly unusual since women were basically used for mating (sex) and for men's personal pleasure; there was to be no pleasure for the woman. Anbessa and Umfazi develop feelings and make love to feel closer to one another.<br /> Another thing that the couple did differently was the way they made love.  The traditional way was for a woman to get down on her hands and knees and the man would could from behind and do his business. One night as they were mating Umfazi decides that she wants to look at Anbessa while they mate, thus the beginning of a new sexual position.  Caraga was the apple of Anbessa's eye which in modern times would not be unusual but at the time when the story takes place men did not associate with children. Yet, Anbessa played with Caraga and loved her like she was his own child, even though she was not.<br />The Second People: The Beginning, was a very different type of book for me. It interwove love and anthropology, two things that I did not think could be linked together. This was a beautiful story and on the RAW scale it is a 4.<br />Simone A.

An Intriguing Tale of Love and Deception	The Price of Passion is an intriguing tale of love and deception laced with suspense.  It ponders the question, &quot;What would you do if your husband came home with his illegimate baby and gave it to you to raise?&quot;<br />This is the exact dilemma of the protagonist, Vivian Carlson, in the story. Complicating the tale even more is that Vivian is married to Walter Carlson, a State Representative who is up for re-election. Vivian has always played by the rules and been the &quot;good&quot; politician's wife.  She has supported Walter, served as his biggest fan, and ignored his many indiscretions.  All of this comes tumbling down when Walter brings home his infant child mid-campaign, and asks Vivian to care for her until he can &quot;figure something out.&quot;  Vivian is apalled by the mere suggestion, but finds herself reluctantly falling into the role of Mother to this unknown child whom Vivian names Passion.<br />The mystery of this story lies in discovering who is Passion's biological mother.  The reader is also pulled into the complicated web of Vivian and Walter's marriage.  Their marriage has been hanging on a string for many years prior to Passion's arrival, but it seems the only one to notice is Vivian. Vivian gains enormous strength from Passion's presence in her life.  She develops the courage to achieve some of her dreams.  Walter, on the other hand, finally notices Vivian when he is at risk of losing her.<br />The Price of Passion is an engrossing read, particularly in this time of political sexcapades.  Palfrey supports the main characters with a compelling cast of strong, likable characters.  The Price of Passion reads like a soap opera.  Each page promises a new discovery or twist of fate.  It is a 4 on the RAW scale.<br />Reviewed by: Diane Marbury (HonestD)	2001-05-18

A Sorority Adventure	Walking The Line by Althea Christina Hughes was truly a wonderful book to read. When I saw the book, the title alone caught my attention. I was totally impressed by Ms. Hughes' story line of college life  and sororities. It actually brought back memories of my long forgotten college days.<br />What I enjoyed most about the book is how easily you could identify with the characters and their quest for belonging. Reading this book brought smiles, laughs, vindication, and finally tears.<br />Ms. Hughes' novel portrays a typical college senior who has waited until her senior year to pledge her mother's sorority with little, if any, enthusiasm. Her family are dedicated Rho Kappa Delta Sorors, with a family legacy and tradition that insist all female members become RKD sorors.<br />Charisma, who prefers being called Charis, is a 4.0 senior pondering with the decision, after graduation, to either go to law school and become a lawyer like her father, or become a playwright, which is<br />what she truly wants to do. Kyra, president of the sorority, who hates Charis and knows of her family's legacy, coerces her into pledging the Rho Kappa Delta. She's manipulative, conniving, controlling and Charis' worse nightmare. Kyra is also the person Charis' former boyfriend was secretly seeing while being with her, which hurt Charis very much. Randall, Charis' former boyfriend, is a  playa, who does not realize he's being played also, until it's  too late.<br />The story revolves around walking the line which is pledging and hazing. Although hazing has become illegal, RDK feels it's still necessary to truly weed out those who are not strong and true RKD material. So they secretly continue to haze.<br />The novel is about Charis' struggle along with others, walking the line and the hazing they must endure. She also has to struggle with her parents' issues which includes her father,  a successful attorney, who leaves his law practice to open a bookstore which causes a separation with Charis' mother, who  enjoys the elite lifestyle, but has a secret of her own.<br />Charis' classmates are a unique cast of characters that will make you laugh, say what, shake your head, and cheer on. Sean, studying to become a doctor of natural medicine, admires and loves Charis, and will patiently wait for her to reciprocate those same feelings. Briana, Charis' roommate, who plans to become a world class journalist, makes it her business to collect the &quot;dirt&quot; on everyone on campus and even goes to the point of keeping files. LaTasha, who takes hazing to the max, has among other things, shoplifting issues. Angela just wants to belong and become a RKD. Desiree, Angela's roommate, is a wannabe RKD and soon makes waves when she is not invited to walk the line. Terrene, also a wannabe RKD and not invited, has socializing issues causing people to dislike her, which is her way of getting the attention she longs for. The finale will make you truly understand the turmoil of belonging and being a part of an elite sorority with devastating results.<br />Overall, Walking The Line is a mixture of college life and the coming of age to being true to self. Ms. Hughes' novel is one you will truly enjoy. I highly recommend it and give it a RAW rating of 5.is' mother, who  enjoys the elite lifestyle, but has a secret of her own.<br />Charis' classmates are a unique cast of characters that will make you laugh, say what, shake your head, and cheer on.

Questions Answered!	Does Homosexuality remain the greatest taboo in black culture? Is homosexuality a European cultural imposition on Africans? Are you black first or queer? These are the important questions that Delroy Constantine-Simms, the editior of The Greatest Taboo, sets about to answer by compiling twenty-eight essays from such heralded authors as Bell Hooks, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Seth Clark Silberman, Gregory Conerly, and Gloria Wekker. <br />The interesting thing about this collection, other than the fact that it is long overdue, is that it examines homosexuality in both men and women are far back as slavery times. If one is a fan of non-fiction, thought-provoking reading, then The Greatest Taboo is definitely one for the collection. There has long been a stigma surrounding homosexuality, mostly from those who fear something they cannot understand. I think this is an important book for everyone to read and I highly recommend it.<br />Zane, RAW Reviewer	2001-05-18
Definite GUY Book	As the back cover of this book asks, are you a nice guy constantly  passed over by women?  Are you a player who can get every woman  except the one you love?  If so...then &quot;Nice Guys and Players:  Becoming the Man Women Want&quot; is the book for you.  In a very clear  and conversatorial tone, author Rom Wills talks to men about the  secret to attracting women, how women categorize men, why women pass  over nice guys, why women fall for players, understanding the needs  of women, the physical and personality traits women find attractive,  and generating sexual chemistry.<br />I will say that this non-fiction book is a quick read and men will find  it to be very informative, giving them an inside look at how women think  when it comes to men and relationships.  Wills mentions in the book that  this is a book for men; however, women can read it to.  I have to say he's  right on point, because this is definitely a man's book.  As a woman, I  found some of the thoughts of woman to be a little iffy; one most poignant.<br />Wills discusses four factors that go into the understanding of women, and  one of them was that women are vain, they want attention.  Now I'd agree,  women like attention, men do too; however, wanting attention does not equal being vain.  The author uses as proof the cosmetic industry and that women  spend so many hours fixing their hair and putting on make up...or wearing  high heels and short dresses, why?  To gain attention.  Now, this may be  the truth for some women, but when you look at the fact that women are  often considered objects and that there's this epitome of beauty in society  that women try to adhere to, it's not just about being vain that women do  these things.<br />Wills was on point with several factors and discussion topics, and men will  find this book to be very valuable.  Who knows, it just might help you get  the woman you really want.<br />Shonie, RAW Reviewer	2001-05-18
Powerful Collection of Short Stories	Please Tell Me If The Grass is Greener is a small collection of short  stories by Joylynn Jossel.  Seven unique stories unfold in this collection  that takes the reader on a journey through aspects of life that aren't  always green, aren't always perfect...or pretty.  Prostitution, drugs,  depression, suicide, murder, love, lust, and dating are just a few of the  aspects that these intriguing stories touch upon.<br />I was totally enthralled by Jossel's stories and her writing.  The majority  of the stories were not heavy in dialogue, relying on the story's narrator  to come across strong in his or her thoughts in the piece.  The voices  DEFINITELY come across, and bring the reader front and center to some serious  issues.  There's not one person who will be able to read these stories and not  find at least one that will touch them, move them.  I would definitely recommend  this collection to other readers, and will be on the lookout for other works by  Jossel.<br />Reviewed by Shonie	2001-05-18
Ashes Over Oakland	Billy is Dead.  Flea, Billy's girlfriend, is Missing.  And Maceo Redfield, Billy's friend and Flea's one time lover is on a mission to find Billy's killer and the whereabouts of Flea.<br />The Dying Ground is Nichelle's Tramble hard hitting and gritty debut novel.  The story takes place during the late 80s and is set in the mean streets of Oakland, CA where violence and drugs seem to be the norm on an everyday basis.  The eighties had brought a fast and furious new industry into Oakland, the crack trade, and there was evidence of it everywhere you looked.  The receiving of the casket had become a tradition on the Oakland streets.  The protagonist, Maceo Redfield, was the by-product of crack addicted parents who lived in the streets, died in the streets and abandoned him at a young age.  His grandparents stepped in and raised him in a loving and nurturing middle income environment; they even had enough love for the stray friends that he took up with especially long-time childhood friends Holly and Billy.  As the years would roll over, the three friends would grow up and go their separate ways but that childhood bond would always keep them close in spirit.  Holly and Billy, with very little hands-on family guidance would follow the ways of the street, while Maceo would be guided by loving grandparents and steered toward sports.  Baseball would become his end-all as it will keep him out of trouble during the vulnerable high school years and help him secure a college baseball scholarship.<br />Due to an injured arm, Maceo's baseball career will be put on hiatus, and he will just happen to be at home and hanging out in the neigborhood barbershop when word comes that Billy's dead and Flea's missing.  No amount of love, discipline or family concern will keep him from placing himself and his family in jeopardy when he decides to go underground to find out why his friend's life was ended so young and so tragically.  As Macoe journeys to uncover what happened to Billy and Flea he will become entangled in the code of the street and be drawn deeper into a life filled with violence, drugs, death and no real or true loves.  But it is truth he seeks and truth he will find in the search for Billy's killers and answers to Flea's disappearance.<br />The Dying Ground is a well-written debut novel which starts out strong and quickly captured my interest; however, about mid-way the story faltered and lost steam.  I was looking for more action and drama, afterall this was touted as suspense/mystery.  In the end, I was moved just enough to finish The Dying Ground. On the positive, Ms. Tramble convincingly writes from the viewpoint of a young black male.  Dying Ground is a  book overall about murder, revenge, drugs, violence, secrets and unrequited love.  If you like a little mystery in your novel then this might be a good book to check out.<br />Yasmin M. Coleman	2001-05-18
Does time bear all dreams?	Due to several book club discussions, I started this book with much apprehension.  I was prepared for a reckless, off the hook kinda  sistah, with no direction.  But I was very surprised to meet an  impressionable young  woman whose face I've seen countless times,  even in a mirror once.  The main character Kayla, has yet to realize  that she must learn how to be happy, before she can offer the job,  of helping her stay happy, to someone else.  She's  20 years old and  has lived 15 of those years waiting for her prince to swoop down and  carry her somewhere they can live happily ever after.  Sound like a  fantasy?  Well that was Kayla's problem, and that caused much of her  heartache.<br />YoYo Love is the correct title for this book, because she bounced from  one encounter to the next falling into something, each time thinking it  was love.  Kayla meets Wil and begins one unbelievable ride.  Why would  you just believe anything you are told, without checking it out. And how  many times must you catch someone with their hands in the cookie jar  before you realize, HELLOOO..., they are stealing cookies?  When Kayla  for the 3rd time says, &quot;this is over&quot;, and cuts Wil loose, she  meets Samir and more drama begins.<br />She has been played so many times, that she decides to market her own  game. She's going to date Samir and Wil, who is back for the 4th time,  at the same time.  Kayla knows that Wil is still carrying some very heavy baggage and that he is lying about his life at home, and she still wants  to trust him.<br />The moral of the story did not manifest itself in this book, but why  should it? Life's answers do not unfold so readily, sometimes it takes a  lifetime to get it right.<br />Daamiah has the premise for a story that is sadly realistic, it was told from an urban view, with urban expectations.  I applaud her ability to let  us peep at one sector of living 'young' in America.<br />aNN	2001-05-18

After the Glitter	The title of McCann's new book, Forever, made me wonder what really lasts  forever, does life, love or even death?  And why do we exert so much energy  trying to make something last forever instead of getting all the good we can,  to last just for a lifetime.  But I digress, this is a story about what  happens after the glitter, it is centered around 2 couples trying to decide if  they want to invest in themselves and make what they share last.  But the  characters seem too insecure to open themselves and too unsure to trust that  what they feel will be enough.  <br />The main characters, Drew and Betty were  fresh from bad relationships, they  hastily married because they both feared the other would change their mind.  While Betty, a lawyer is embroiled in the biggest murder trial of her career,  Drew is spending too much time caring for his ailing mother and things become strained, add to that mix, a lover from Betty's past, and they had me wondering if their  marriage would last another month, forget forever.  <br />Their respective best  friends, Jacqui and Stefan have their own issues, Jacqui's restaurant is  booming and she is mad in love with Stefan, he is 40 years old and still  pursuing a career as a model.  He wants to be financially stable before he  commits, but Jacqui's biological clock is ticking, she wants to get married now.<br />This book reads like you're sitting down talking to a friend, it is a mature  account of how issues, real or perceived, can cause so many problems when left  to fester.    Drew was afraid to ask Betty why she married him, why she refuses to sell her  house and why she rolls away from him in bed.  Betty is afraid she still has  feelings for her ex Evander, and she is afraid that if she gives all, Drew will leave  her like all the other men she loved. Both were afraid to ask if they married  to soon, so they grow further apart. Is divorce the answer?  And if so, then  what happens to the theory of Forever?<br />McCann has written one of the best sequels I have read, he is a voice that will  be heard over and over again.  Reading this was like taking a good strong sip  of humility!  This is an excellent story, one you do not want to miss.<br />aNN Brown<BR> The RAW Reviewers	2001-04-19

From Roots to Crops!!!	The Harvest is the genealogy of the Mixon family in which Dr. Smiley gives a factual and  colorful account of the beginning, the journey and the conclusion of several  generations of Mixons.  She chronicles her life, from birth on a plantation in   Alabama to receiving her doctorate in Education, with significant events that  shaped who she is.  The story is documented with historical facts about our  struggle and rise as a people. It is written as a legacy to generations that  will follow and as a consciousness raising opportunity.  Dr. Smiley introduces  three 'fields', if you will, that she relates to  harvesting:  the biblical, human, and natural fields.<br />Biblical field,  she views as souls preparing for that time when the Lord shall return to harvest his crop, when he will separate the wheat from the tariff.   <br />Human field, she talks about our struggle as a people to cultivate ourselves,  that we may continue  to grow strong, produce good fruit (offspring) and <br />maintain much of our inheritance.<br />Natural field,  as defined in Webster, is the act or process of gathering in a  crop, (as of grain or fruit), she shares the opportunity the family had to   harvest the cotton plant, which provided their livelihood.<br />Dr Smiley presents an excellent family history, she shares her involvement in the Civil Rights struggle and she shows the depth of her religious roots, which were very prevalent in this work. A tremendous amount of research was  done to produce this. This book is written like a study guide and is not a book to read just for entertainment. <br />aNN Brown <BR>RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2001-04-19
Emotional, Heartbreaking, Real	Butterscotch Blues is a story about friendships, about relationships and about vows. It's about 4 young ladies who met and bonded in college, who vowed to always be there for each other and to not let relationships diminish what  they shared.  Margaret, is an Assistant District of Attorney, 7 years overdue  for a relationship, but her bar is too high, her man must have,'PhD', appending his name. Janice desperately wants a relationship and will empower any man to  make her happy.  Britney is timid and overweight and is in the friendship  because she has no where else to be.  But this is really not their story, this story belongs to dark and lovely Sandy Hutchinson,  the black sheep of her  family, literally.  It belongs to a gorgeous Trinidadian man with  butterscotch  eyes, who captures her heart, invades her space and shares her greatest  tragedy.  It is a story of how the friendship shifts when the relationship  pendulum swings to one and not the other and the friends are not there for each  other.  Ultimately this is a story of vows and the sanctity of their meaning.  The  story of a commitment that allows Sandy to hold on, as the tragedy unfolds.  And it is the story of how to live the words, 'in good times and in  bad, in  sickness and in health, till death us do part'.<br />When I read the last page and closed the book, I sat with tissue in hand and  gathered my emotions.  I wanted to call someone and offer my support, then I  smiled as I realized this wasn't real.<br />What I loved most about this book, is I felt it.  Felt the love, the  indecision, the sadness, the despair, and then I felt the acceptance, the  oneness and finally the peace.<br />aNN Brown, The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2001-04-19
A LESSON ON HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF	A New Day the sequel to The Real Deal starts like a story book, two souls looking for love.  But Max and Carol-Ann bring so much baggage to the table, they had me wondering 'who's zooming who'? Max Scutter, 36, single, very successful, is lost and hurting.  He is afraid of marriage, children, and has &quot;I'm not ready&quot;, engraved on his forehead.  One mistake cost him the love of his life and his unborn child.  He meets Carol-Ann and her eight year old daughter, does a 360 degree turn and wants to be their Knight in armor, but Max still loves Samone.  Carol-Ann is 38, a single mother, has always lived in the basement of life, has never felt loved or needed, all she's ever felt, is not good enough. She learned from her mother that children out of wedlock was ok, so Carol dates her boss, gets pregnant on purpose and quits her job.  For eight years she's lived in Spanish Harlem between condemned buildings, struggling to make ends meet.  But, Carol never brought closure to her relationship.  Then, she meets Max and when he offers a solution, she accepts and moves in with him. She soon resents Max for trying to make her fit his life style and she's on the move again, she just can't get it right.  Max has now decided to be a player, and Carol is prostituting herself with her ex, for child support.  But they both know their lives can't live here, they need to take a timeout, take a nap and wake to a new day.<br />Ms J-Hodge, creates her characters with such realism, you don't just read the story, you share it.  I love that she doesn't take her characters back, she allows them to look back, but with a gentle hand, she pushes them forward.  Some books tend to linger, for me, A New Day is one of them.<br />aNN Brown<br /> The RAW Reviewers	2001-04-19
