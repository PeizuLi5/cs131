Unsatisfying	The details may be right, but this never grabbed me. A work centered on action, but who cares?	2005-10-12
Write what you know	So why does a lawyer, who does employment law, write a novel about a criminal lawyer? Predictable and full of holes, this left a lot to be desired.	2005-10-12
Krueger cooks	The author gets better with each outing. But the ending here is different than before. More unfinished business and an apparent break from family and surroundings. What's going on?	2005-10-11
Better	A strong action story. Less conspiracy than other entries and better for it. Let's hope more are coming.	2005-10-11
The reader wins	Sometimes a book will sit for a while before it gets read. Others appear more appealing. I won't make that mistake again. The author manages to teach you something each book, and that makes it valuable. A good puzzle,interesting characters, and the pages turn quickly.	2005-09-21
A pleasant start	The mystery is no big deal and is much too easy. But the real bad guys, some who survived, are around for the next installment. A writer who shows promise. I'll get the next one.	2005-09-20
Strange	Interesting premise gets into a lot of navel gazing, finally gets moving, takes a twist, finishes with another and still doesn't satisfy. Could be a good movie with a strong screenplay. Worth a look.	2005-09-16
Page turner	Good action read. But do we really need more secret organization stuff? Strange to read about New Orleans while Katrina's winds howl.	2005-09-16
For a cat?	The beatings our hero takes and survives, qualify him as a superhero. An interesting collection of bad guys and lowlifes keep interest high. And when he's mad, vengence is swift. Enough reason to look for the follow-up.	2005-09-13
Surprise	That this is not a one hit wonder, is the big surprise, and shows signs of going unexpected places is another. A very well done second book. Not for the squeamish or those annoyed by alliteration.	2005-08-26
Bestseller, if there is any justice	While plots, done paint by number, fill the shelves, true thrillers like this, are passed over. If you have not yet found this series, go back one book,\\"After the Rain\\", and you will be hooked. Surpassing John Sanford's recent efforts, these page-turners are rewarding and give the reader hope that good writing still exists. My wife told me to turn out the light last night at 1:30 AM, I finished before breakfast.	2005-08-17
Out of the swamp	Max comes to the city and his past, and revitalizes the series. a very well told tale that will reassure readers that Max is for real.	2005-08-16
Cool	Elmore Leonard does it best, but this author is on the right track. I'll look for his other work.	2005-08-08
Much better than the last	but... A motive that leaves the reader wondering how apt the phrase overkill is.<br /><br />A writer who can weave a spell, tho he still struggles from time to time.	2005-07-31
Keep a list	You're going to need a list to keep track of the characters and relationships. This proved to be a distracting aspect to the usual sex, drugs and violence we expect from Crumley. Isn't CW getting a little old for this?<br /><br />Michael Connelly gets a nice tip of the hat here and also in James Lee Burke's Latest.	2005-07-31
Dave needs women	and he finds \\" a stand up\\" one in his new adventure. No one is better than Burke to put you in the Big Sleazy. Another outstanding example of fine writing. Enjoy.	2005-07-22
Growing pleasure	Have you got five minutes? Spend the time, read one story a day. You will look foward each day to something different. A talented writer gives us a unique twist on... something. As much as I enjoy Doc Ford, I really enjoy the non-fiction. I'll work my way thru the rest.	2005-07-19
Disappointment	At some point you realize that all the threads of the story will never be tied up as the books remaining pages disappear. Then when the end arrives, so does anger. I can accept that this is the first of, how many? But the complex absurdity of the ending is insulting in this world, where a fanatic with a backpack cannot be stopped.	2005-07-17
new start	an interesting new series. Lots of coincidences. Let's see if the author can go new places.	2005-07-11
return to those days	These guys aren't seventy and the author has found fertile ground for his talent. Are these really tips of the hat to, among others, Stephen King and Joan Baez? (Randall Flagg and Virgil Cane)	2005-06-29
Confession is good for the soul	Enlightening as to just how bad those guys were/are. Scary guys.	2005-06-29
Disappointed	This did not live up to the promise of the first novel. Much of the success of the first book was the local color. Now we're dealing with the CIA and assorted international bs. Too bad.  The end promises more, this is where I get off.	2005-06-20
DomesticTerror	Bad guys act with impunity. Good guys' families pay the price for their diligence. Almost everyone is dirty or complicit. Powerful indictment of our war on drugs. WMD that continues unabated.	2005-06-09
Put him on your list	It is always a joy to find a new writer. One with the ability to set the hook and reel you into his world. Montana and Wyoming have provided a home for writers and settings for their stories, but recently their numbers seem to have exploded. A well done story, good characters, a literate mind and a good time. I'll be back for more.	2005-06-09
A stretch	Up to the usual high standards, plus the great addition of some rock and roll, but the author goes to great lengths to create a scenerio that goes beyond plausible. Time for another Kidd.	2005-06-07
Gunfighter	He hangs with loose women, chooses his words carefully, and does what he says. A 20th century western. It does seem he can find the bad guys with surprising ease, but that is only a minor point. Another Leonard to treasure.	2005-05-31
Don't quibble...	the pages turn quickly, but helicopter raids? Joe is still tough, but maybe he needs to get away from the Mafia.	2005-05-26
Much better than the last	A return to form is welcome. Bosch is back on the job. The bad guy is not much of a poker player. One hopes this continues.	2005-05-26
Lean mountain thriller	The title can refer to rifles, phones and relationships. Very well handled by the author, this series just gets better and better.	2005-05-26
Hard Work	The author shares with us not only his pictures, but how the capture was accomplished. Well done.	2005-05-25
Derivative	The author takes elements and plot that we've seen before, many times, and gives us a protaganist that we like to follow. Dumb enough to fall, smart enough to know he's hooked. We go along for the ride.	2005-05-17
A good new voice.	Interesting hero, over the top serial killer, good basis for future tales. We really don't need monsters to make this work. The author has enough with average Elmore-Leonard-like gangsters to carry the day.	2005-05-04
Much better than his last	Once the action starts, the reader is along for the ride. Our hero's love life, however, is like watching a teen pine for his perfect love, very hard to take. But overall a very good adventure.	2005-05-04
Don't go	...without this book. A great fast-read action work with protaganists we hope to see again.	2005-04-26
You're going to like this	If you enjoy the Doc Ford series, you are in for a pleasant surprise. The author in these engaging true life tales charms, informs and entertains. A lot of fun, I hope to see more.	2005-04-22
Do we care?	A page-turner that fails to make us connect with any of the characters.	2005-04-22
Strong Beginnings	This is a very good story of a small Texas town and the very human people that inhabit it. The solution to the mystery is not a huge surprise, but our hero's handling of it bodes well for the future of this character. Let's hope the author can sustain the momentum.	2005-04-13
The B Side	A lesser effort. A good story teller here lacks a good story. This one will put you to sleep on the beach.	2005-04-01
I need to be locked up to finish this	Too much for too little a payoff. The author writes more and delivers less.	2005-04-01
a great B movie	This is really a cowboy tale, gunslingers and bad guys and no holds barred. Delta sniper teams are the modern day reference for this much older story. It's been done before, but a tale well told is always appreciated.	2005-03-30
Doc is back	A much better plot than the last two entries in the series, and it is fun. White has created a couple of memorable, monstrous villains in the last couple of books and left them alive. Will we see them again?<br />Doc Ford's domestic situations continue to be a puzzle for such an intelligent hero and the weakest part of the stories.	2005-03-30
A warrior	Not about the battle, but the man prepared to fight one. The men we need in tough times are not neccessarily the ones you want to live next to. Well done.	2005-03-23
Lost in the woods	The story starts off with promise, but quickly strays into a mishmash of mental health issues and a beyond belief murder plot.	2005-03-15
Master Craftsman	Joining together characters, who have each held their own in earlier stand-alone novels, Crais shows his mastery. An excellent read in a very good series.	2005-03-07
Crash course in combat	I knew a man who was not proud of what he did in battle. A bronze star winner, he would not talk about WWII. In this story a young man is baptized in a battle so intense, that combat fatigue is shown within 5 days. You will not need a lot of time to read this book, you won't put it down.	2005-03-07
Average collection	With the exception of the Stephen King story, nothing stays with the reader. Workman-like but that's all.	2005-03-07
Titanic lessons, not learned.	\\"A Night to Remember\\" is prologue. Surprising similarities are the biggest surprise of this work. Heart breaking tragedy and displays of courage are the page turners. No thriller can match the stories told here. One for the ages.	2005-03-01
A White Castle Burger	You hunger for something tasty. It goes down easy, and turns to waste even quicker. Ahh,to be rich and murderous. The pages turn quickly but what a waste of time. If this is, as advertised, the thriller of the year, God help us.	2005-02-22
More to come	An obvious first of a series, but nonetheless an engaging work that keeps you turning pages. Well researched and peopled with interesting characters. I'll be there for the next one.	2005-02-21
An interesting Mix	Historical fiction with a modern eye overseeing all. Learned about some new people, but the pacing left a lot to be desired.	2005-02-18
Action but no thrill	A fill in the blanks thriller. Good guys? with lots of money seek revenge and then try to avoid retribution. An obvious first of more to come, but it hasn't hooked me.	2005-02-06
A lot of work	It takes a long time to get to a place where you've been before, a crazed beyond-human serial killer. Some interesting facts, but a good editor might have made it more rewarding.	2005-02-06
Life is a wheel	He hooks you at the beginning, then slows down a little, but then you are along for the ride. You've come this far, you must finish. You may not be happy, but he has warned you, and hinted, and told you how it would be done. And he even leaves openings for more. King is king.	2005-01-13
Too much political intrique	Good action, but not enough of it.The author shouldn't attempt a George Smiley, it's been done. Go with the action, he does it well.	2005-01-06
If for no other reason, the writing	Billy Bob is not the center of the action, but this is still a very good story by one of the best in the business. (Just how many writers live in Missoula?) Spend some quality time in Montana.	2004-12-28
A Present for Christmas	The second of a series, this owes a lot to Rod Serling; but you owe it to yourself to read a well written story at any time of the year.	2004-12-24
Why do we care?	Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry.	2004-12-09
Need for Speed	A fine procedural, but this series is losing action. More like a textbook than a novel. Each book adds characters, why not some action?	2004-12-03
Easy readin	The author at the top of his game. The LA riots of the 60's. An unbeatable combination. I just wish Denzel kept making the movies.	2004-11-30
Action and betrayal	Good action in two hemispheres. But a little too tricky. A simpler conspiracy might have been more believable, but this is a well done tale by a very good author.	2004-11-23
Left me cold	Not up to the level of earlier works. At about the 3/4 of the way in flipped to the end to confirm suspicion and gratefully ended the effort. Characters could not hold our interest and the mystery was TV grade.	2004-11-19
Grab this tight.	The author has read Shane and can write a lean and hungry story. One of a series of stories set at Christmas time. If you love good writing, get this story.	2004-11-19
Give yourself a Gift	A short story that shines. Spend a little time with this first in a series of stories set at Christmas time. Childhood gift that resonates. Please do yourself a favor get this book and then share the news of a great read. The author's recent work left me underwhelmed, this puts him back on my must read list.	2004-11-19
Another story from the bulge	The authors do a fine job of showcasing the accomplishments of the African American tankers but also illuminate some of the overlooked battles during that horrendous winter. Good job.	2004-11-17
Something Completely Different	Engaging look thru an autistic's eyes. An education in a mystery.A unique experience.	2004-11-11
Shades of Ellroy	From the opening the author shows his skill. He creates a world and draws the reader in. Though the villain is a little Bondish, the joy of a polished work is enough. Looking forward to more.	2004-10-30
Chaos	You won't want to visit the \\"stans\\", Few survive, those who do are changed beyond their belief. A thriller that is much more. Damnation and redemption, hate and love. A skilled writer shows you people and places, that, if you are lucky, you will never get to see.	2004-10-20
Twisted to the good	A different serial killer. Our hero. Though the ending is seen from far ahead, this is worthy of following.	2004-10-12
Engaging	Well done martial arts mystery. Surprised? Me too. The author is skilled and the hook is set early, and we are not disappointed.	2004-10-12
a winning mix	Lansdale is a prize winning author in a number of genres. Here he creates an East Texas historical mystery horror soap. And is it good. Grab the train heading to Camp Rapture and slow down for a great story.	2004-10-08
Disappointed	Trite set up made it impossible to maintain interest. Though I love his Hardesty stuff this left me cold.	2004-10-08
Quick and dirty	Good action read with another flawed hero. A promising writer. This one could go to the screen.	2004-09-30
Haunting	I live near Worcester,Mass., which borders a lake- Quinsigamond, The city also houses a Jesuit college and a railroad station, once in disrepair and the scene of crimes.And a bar named Gilrein's. Take the familiar and throw it into a brilliant twisted mix of fact and horror, and you get one angle on this work. Work your way through and you will be haunted. The nature of humanity, its inhumanity, the destructive nature of revenge. All this and more. It ain't easy- but wow.	2004-09-30
Heat in Charlestown	Well done cops and robbers, acknowledging a debt to the movies, this is a good read. Boston-based and authentic scenery add to the attraction. Go Sox, see Fenway like never before.	2004-09-17
Mooning	This one dragged. Earlier books held interest easier and longer, this one was a chore. Hope the next is better because he can write.	2004-09-07
Action	The action doesn't stop, but reality never gets started. The characters are TV grade and as the plot gets more absurd the pleasure goes away, and the effort to finish the book increases.	2004-09-04
Too much prologue	When the action happens, it works, but too much of the book is review of the characters and updates on their personal lives.	2004-08-28
Beach Read	Throw logic to the winds. Open a cold drink, find a comfortable seat and relax. A page turner, no more, no less.	2004-08-21
Fanatics	The author, raised a Mormon, focuses on the fanaticism practiced by some Mormons and find the sources in the history of the sect. A very troubling study of the lives led today in our country. When someone tells you God talks to them, watch out. When they say God wishes them to spill blood, run. Osama could identify with some of the sentiments here.	2004-08-19
Raymond Chandler meets Swayze	The gimmick long suspected takes 115 pages to confirm and even longer to partially explain. The ending leaves us in purgatory, unsatisfied and longing for answers. The author can write and succesfully creates a mood that is difficult to shake. If this is a series, it will be interesting to see where it goes.	2004-08-17
The other author	provides the most interesting aspect of this chapter . It takes a while to regain interest in the story, but King comes thru. The other author is a confessional that seems to say interesting things. \\"The Dark Half\\" again? Bring on the final.	2004-08-07
Can't skim this.	The author has honed his craft so that each line must be read to follow the action. Always a master of dialogue, this writing is almost abstract. A return to Detroit provides great cop stories.	2004-08-07
Swamp thing	A return of themes and some characters are the reward of this good beach read. Always a pleasure.	2004-08-03
Let the D girls do it	Remember to put on the sunscreen, if you take this one to the beach. You'll be hooked and not paying attention to much else. Timely and well written, this is a higher level than the other thrillers done by this author and way above some bestsellers that have reached a wider audience. D girls are Delta and GI Jane on steroids. There are descriptions that stop you and make you go back to marvel at the author's skill. Get this book.	2004-07-20
Time to run for sheriff	Another great story rewards the reader of this Wyoming mystery. But it's time to give Joe reason to stick his nose where it don't belong. Joe for sheriff.	2004-07-16
Outback battles	Good action with some mystical stuff thrown in. The author knows his stuff and it shows, I await his next work.	2004-07-11
Been in the sun too long	Doc Ford is usually interesting and fun to follow. This time he seems to have left his brain at home. Great bad guy, but no conclusion. Personal relationship revisions, past history revised, juvenile emotions in adults, missing the obvious- what's happening here? A narrative that is disjointed and unfocused. A son kidnapped, but Ford goes off on all kinds of secondary tangents. A frustrating, disappointing read.	2004-07-04
Reacher meets Agatha Christie	A very good procedural puzzle, but lacks the action we have come to expect. This and the last entry spent a lot of time on the road. Less of a time and motion study would be appreciated the next time.	2004-06-26
Solid action	Outstripped by the discoveries of no wmd in Irag, this is still a good action tale. Skimming is enough.	2004-06-26
A most unusual revenge tale	I recalled the line from &quot;The Wolfman&quot; after reading this well written tale (&quot;even a man with a pure heart&quot; or something to that effect). An unforgetable read. Past sins may be forgiven, but never forgotten. Get this one.	2004-06-26
There is power here	Although two infamous Boston search warrant cases fuel the plot(as also &quot;The Cinderella Affidavit&quot;), it is the family scenes that carry real power. The ending is a not-unexpected twist, and the author may have tried too many plot elements, but he shows real potential and his next work is anxiously awaited.	2004-06-07
Plot Stretch	Sandford's a pro, but this time the plot is not up to the usual level. Too much commuting makes for car sickness. His Kidd was a good entry, Let's hope Lucas comes back stronger.	2004-06-04
Strong start	This series is well written and one hopes GPS doesn't become a crutch in all the books. Great hopes for the future.	2004-06-04
Housecleaning	Connelly kills off one character, probably to preclude Eastwood making a bad movie from one of his books. The return of other characters leads to a housecleaning of sorts. Bosch finds reemployment and perhaps rejuvenation for the next outing. This one felt like a half-hearted movie sequel.	2004-05-22
A lesser entry	Anticlimatic to a fault. The dialogue is smooth and the reading flows easily, but the ending is a serious let down. Much ado about nothing.	2004-05-14
He can write	I'll have to get the earlier books, because this man is a pro. He can give you the texture of the Glades and the taste of the city.	2004-05-08
BAMF	Ridley gives you the unexpected. Not a bad thing in today's cookie-cutter world. Not always satisfying, but you have to read. He's on the edge of a big one, I want to see it when it comes.	2004-05-08
Action	A very good thriller that will keep you turning the pages and looking for the next work by this author.	2004-05-03
You talk too much	Not as engaging as the most recent entries in the series. This story moves focus away from Milo. Additionally the ending is unsatisfactory, leaving a bad guy beyond reach.	2004-05-03
Far out and far fetched	but a page turner for the beach. I took it on vacation and it worked to move the sun along. Battles in space, on the sea and in cyberspace.	2004-05-03
Contrivance	Pearson likes to take technology or science and fashion a plot around cutting edge discoveries. This time the science is old,and the ultimate solution is unexplained and leaves the reader unsatisfied. The relationship between Boldt and his wife, with all they have been through, just doesn't feel right in this one. He's done better.	2004-04-24
Getting better every time.	You can feel an author becoming confident and skilled. Krueger has produced a great book. The hero, torn by two cultures, searches for the nature of faith. Around him people fall short, losing or betraying their own faith and self-esteem. A real good read.	2004-04-16
Mid Series	Not having read any of these before, this entry feels just like beginning a movie an hour into it. Passable action but does not really stand alone.	2004-04-16
A surprise	At first, the book feels insubstantial, too light. Then the spare, lean language flowing like water drags you along to deeper meaning. At the end genuine emotion appears, surprising the reader that this work could produce the result. A very good book.	2004-03-27
A Hard Man	Life has kicked our hero, but he can kick back. Well plotted tale of revenge and redemption, will keep you hooked. A good read.	2004-03-26
Masterful	A page turner with recent history, philosphy, and payback in the mix. A good one from an old master.	2004-03-20
Bad drugs, bad guys, good read	There is a movie here, with great characters and good action. Is anyone paying attention? An absolute page turner, with an old fashioned hero, a brave mother and retribution. Have fun.	2004-03-18
I'll be back	A new hero, who keeps it interesting, will see me again. A passable plot, with some new viewpoints, make it worthwhile.	2004-03-15
Keeps moving	A read to turn the pages. Plenty of red herrings to keep you guessing and enough action to reward your perseverance. Good job.	2004-03-15
Good solid action tale	The author takes the time to get the action right. No movie car chases or explosions, his are what would really happen, if your gas tank exploded. An enjoyable adventure read.	2004-03-10
Lessons to learn	Enough blame to go around, but we have learned from our mistakes. Let's not forget. A must read, if you really want to understand how 9/11 came about. A homework assignment for all citizens.	2004-03-04
A friend of James Crumley	and Crumley writes the intro. If that is not enough of a recommendation, you need to read more. Our hero is another man of dubious goals, who becomes involved with very bad people, while looking for employment and love in all the wrong places. Good action. Interesting grammar. South Texas has a hero.	2004-02-23
Author's been there...	done that, and it shows. His writing is lean and sharp. A fun read with no bs.	2004-02-18
How they do it	Take American kids and turn them into leaders. This is not the West Point you think you know. Fascinating and comforting. You will be hooked and looking to the end of the book for any info on those you meet.	2004-02-15
New	New characters, setting and purpose hold the readers attention. One could quibble with why the hero is left to discover things on his own while people die, but this is a welcome new idea from a reliable author.	2004-02-12
Knowledgeable	The author knows the law and lawyers, which takes this tale above many of the rest. The plot twists stretch credibility, but a very good first novel.	2004-02-12
Something missing	We read books like this to look into the eyes of the killers. To wonder where things went wrong. To hope our children don't lose their way. One of the killers did not make any statements to the police or talk to the authors. The picture is thus incomplete and unsatisfying and leaves us feeling that there is more to tell.	2004-01-29
In good hands	Ed Dee knows the cops and the crooks and the reader benefits. An ex-cop goes a few rounds with the Russian mob, and his past comes back to haunt him. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading Dee before, start here.	2004-01-21
A cut above his last entry	If you haven't yet followed this series , now is the time to come on board. How much value do we place on a parent, who has treated us badly? Do we come to their aid? Do we chance all we have? Interesting answers here in an action packed thriller.	2004-01-17
Exotic	Very different. Very interesting. Is the oriental mind that different? A tale much like and unlike what you have read before. Snakes, sex, money and Buddha.	2004-01-17
Kidd Again	Kidd is back and we learn more about him and LuEllen, as they hunt the killer of a friend. Power is bequeathed, but will it be used? As always, an excellent job with a different kind of hero.	2004-01-05
Insider	The story is another conspiracy thing and you can see the bad guy 1/3 of the way in. You stay because the author has been there and shares his insider knowledge with you. Always interesting.	2003-12-28
Back to big sleazy	His wife dead, daughter away, our hero is in a rut. Depressed and wanting a drink, he goes thru the motions and is a catalyst for disaster. A slew of characters are never fully developed and we are left wanting. A magnificent writer, but this is not up to his best efforts (except for comments regarding baseball hats and politics).	2003-12-24
Restrained by facts	The history limits what Earl can do, but the trip is entertaining and informative about Cuban history. Where can Hunter go now? If Bob Lee had kids, would one have followed him into the service and some adventures in the recent past?	2003-12-15
Hooked again	&quot;Buick 8&quot; left a lot to be desired, but it only took a few pages to realize that King is back on the beam. Western references abound, go grab those DVD's and see where all this came from. Can't wait for the finish.	2003-12-13
Don't miss this compelling read	Previously titled The Last Ride, this is the basis for the new Ron Howard film. The novel of family, a search for faith and courage, is a page turner that will stay with you. Grab it.	2003-11-22
More down time	This excellent series continues with a procedural that needs more of Kerney, and a little less of the spare step by step police investigation.	2003-11-13
Ride the rails	Not many books have a hobo as a hero, this does. Bleak and unique, you will be introduced to a view not seen before.	2003-11-12
What is this?	Is it a guide to hiking or a thriller? Lack of an indentity causes the book to be skimmed and disappointment to be the result.	2003-11-12
A winter's night entertainment.	One villain is a cartoon, but the author has nevertheless created a page turner. Joe has the help of a new character- to do what Joe cannot, be vengeful and murderous. A series that is getting better all the time.	2003-11-02
Spoiled by conspiracy	Again in this episode, someone tries to kill JFK. For the first 90 pages I was hooked by good writing, interesting characters and facts. Then, one line gives away a big secret and what was entertaining goes down hill fast. Lose the JFK fixation and stick with a flawed, deeply troubled main character.	2003-10-26
New Characters	Cheers to an author who can change the usual characters and get a new voice. Rucka is a talent. Doesn't always score high, but keeps things interesting. In a world of cookie cutter books, that is something.	2003-10-25
A Start	Interesting weaknesses help introduce a new protagonist in this work by a former FBI agent. The bad guys are not what holds our interest this time. Insider insight does. Let's see what the next entry holds.	2003-10-21
Page turner - for a while	The first 80 pages rush at you like the snow storm that drives the action. Then the story meanders for a while before a good end game. This one is worth the time.	2003-10-17
Derivative but individual	There are other psychiatrist protagonists, but this entry finds the hero becoming his own man, not just his own bad habits. Well done.	2003-10-09
Feet of clay	At 15, Harry begins to realize that his heroes, even his parents, were not perfect. He's an angry teen. A little tighter ploting would be welcome, but this is still a page turner in a wonderful series.	2003-09-28
Changes	Atticus transformed. At the end, is he still a bodyguard? And does ballet change everything? The author is taking chances and keeping this series interesting.	2003-09-28
Well done	A first novel with a heavily detailed back story. That may be why the sequel is a prequel. Different view and hero make me look forward to more.	2003-09-07
Tricky	A first novel that holds your interest, but is sometimes too tricky for its own good. Holds promise for future stories.	2003-09-07
Half his usual	The book is half as long as normal, but is unfinished. Obviously the beginning of a new series, the author has solved the Jack Ryan problem. Having promoted his original hero out of the action, here the heroes are the son and nephews of the original. But these kids are without depth or much of a back story. Jack Jr., a rich, spoiled?, college grad with no experience talks himself onto a top secret job and assasination. Huh?<br />The author would still benefit from editing (three descriptions of death by poison), but still knows how to make a reader turn the page. The kids need more seasoning and where are all the old guys? Finish this one.	2003-08-28
Is this a New Reacher?	The last entry in this series was excellent. This one falls short. Here Reacher is as cold as Maine water. Single focus on revenge and robotic in action.<br />Someone should tell the author not to base a plot on a map. Following someone on the interstate from Rt1 in Maine is not plausible.	2003-08-28
Master of coincidence and manipulated endings	If you like being cheated, your logic cast away, and endings that come out of left field, this is for you. Coben's best books were his earliest.	2003-08-28
The Green Flash	Many years ago, John D MacDonald introduced me to the green flash. I've now seen it, if only on the cover of this book. The author's photo glows with the green light at sunset and his book echoes strongly with the convictions first aired by MacDonald. A little too much editorializing, but still a good read.	2003-08-14
Take a seat...	for a chance to play in a fun game. A well told tale in which the reader is entertained and learns a little about cheating. I'll be back for another game.	2003-08-04
Are we supposed to like this guy	It's hard not to. A professional killer works his way onto our good side, while being not so good himself. Enjoy.	2003-08-04
A different culture...	is not enough to sustain a reader's interest. Lots of detail about how to follow someone, repeated endlessly. A villian who's left for another day. Not enough to come back for.	2003-07-25
Change of hero, same great action	Yeah, it is a conspiracy story. But don't shy away from a good action tale. The author consistently delivers your money's worth.	2003-07-18
Dependable	A highly skilled storyteller scores again in the latest Davenport adventure. A good beach read and the author never seems to disappoint. Isn't it time for a new Kidd?	2003-07-14
Annoying	The author knows his stuff, but disappoints when, after introducing characters we care about, has them disappear without detail and off-stage.	2003-07-06
Mind Games	The protaganist's father was a fisherman,...I think, and the hook is set early, and the author reels us into his world with skill and tension. But the fish escapes, and our satisfaction with it, at an ending that doesn't satisfy.	2003-07-05
Workmanlike	A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts.	2003-06-24
Memorable bad guy	This moves when the bad guy is on the page. Gather this one up for an enjoyable summer read.	2003-06-15
On a roll	The author has found a way to keep these books moving. Changing narrators has added zip to the series. Good job.	2003-06-01
Take me back	A good old fashioned style scores big. This is a good one. Nobody's good and some are real bad. The author plays his cards close, and holds to the last page.	2003-05-16
better than the last	But the end is obvious, long before it needs to be. First person narration changes the view, but the character's world weary attitude seems to be the author's attitude as well. Needs to find his energy again.	2003-05-13
Ending by Remo Williams	For a while this one has a good hook. Then about 3/5's of the way thru, it seems a great deal of detail disappears and we get conclusions rather than detection. The ending appears tacked on only for the action potential. Damn, it had me for a time.	2003-05-03
See it before it disappears	A beautiful look at cultural conventions that may soon be relegated to the quaint and unusual.	2003-05-03
See the train coming	That's the gimmick you see, way down the track. And I would have stayed with it, except for the unbelievable \\"Deus ex machina\\" thrown in to save our flawed hero. Nice try. But try again.	2003-04-28
The Men With Him	Allegedly the first of a series of books about Monroe, a sniper, this is really about the people around him. And it is fascinating in detail and characterization. It will be interesting to see where the author goes from here.	2003-04-28
If it had pictures...	it would be a comic book. Shallow characters, beyond belief.	2003-04-20
Way too convoluted	Interesting, damaged characters can't maintain the readers' attention, when presidential conspiracy is added. Lots to like, but ultimately disappointing.	2003-04-20
Fast and easy	The author has written a story that grabs you and drags you in before you know it. Just don't think too deeply, enjoy the rush.	2003-04-06
Post 9-11 New York	A character study of several city dwellers by a master author. Well drawn, but not really satisfying.	2003-04-03
Early effort	A talented author takes a look at a homicide detective. Interesting but lacks real movement. The author improves greatly in later efforts.	2003-04-03
Can't hold interest	The exotic setting and customs are not enough to sustain the readers' interest for the duration of this prelude to WWII.	2003-03-28
Reads like fiction	But it's not. Fascinating look at the system's hunters. The only drawback is that the author sometimes leads you to action, only to cut away and never fully answers your questions. A good read.	2003-03-12
Cast off for action	Oh yeah. You'll want to finish this asap. Except for some wordy summaries, this is one heck of a power ride. The author keeps getting better with each new effort.	2003-03-03
Looking for some fun?	You will find it here. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy a page- turner that doesn't disappoint. Not great literature, but great fun.	2003-02-26
We don't need no characterization	A video game on paper. Levels and all. Read one, read 'em all.<br />Won't have to read it again.	2003-02-24
Masterful	Just because the usual characters aren't here, don't pass this one by. History, colorful characterizations and plenty of action, together with Burke's skillful language, make this a must read. The author maintains his reputation as one of our finest writers.	2003-02-17
Hero	Interesting followup to earlier adventures of Carlos Hathcock, read about a real hero.	2003-02-12
Stuff you didn't know	When brothers talk, they tell things they wouldn't tell anyone else. Dennis Smith shares tales his brother firefighters have told him. There is a lot we didn't know. A valuable record of an important event.	2003-02-09
Losing Strength	A third of thew way thru, you will have spotted the killer and curiosity is the only reason to finish. Strange disappearance of Zee, though she wanders through sometimes. The book is weak.	2003-02-06
Candyman	Imagine nine pieces of the best candy you've ever eaten. You try to take your time, but find you eat them much too quickly. They are gone too soon. You wish there were more. And marvel at the skill of the candymaker.	2003-02-03
Revitalized by a junkie	A new narrator and focus adds vigor and staying power to this series. The reader is hooked early and stays for the ride. A real good read. Let's hope this continues. Hit me with another shot.	2003-02-01
Cold Seas	A page turner that sailors will love. Lot's of action and appealing characters.	2003-01-28
Page turner	The author hooks you, and you stay with him to an ending that does not truly satisfy. Over the course of his career, the philosophy and preaching have increased and intrude on the plot  driven books where he is at his best.	2003-01-19
Welcome back	A talented author combines courtroom drama, witchcraft, colonial history, Indians, preachers and bears, and oh my, pirates too. You will be hooked early and despite the setting and length, stay for the end. Have fun.	2003-01-09
Interesting but not conclusive	The author is obviously convinced she has found the Ripper, but fails to provide the reader with an orderly presentation of the evidence. Her conclusions are not enough to win us over.	2003-01-03
Penance before redemption	When you know the ultimate answer, did the pope survive an assassination attempt, before you begin, the writer needs to keep our attention. &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; accomplished this many years ago. This book isn't even close. Do we really need the personal political philosophies of every major character? Or the benefits of single faucet sinks? The last 100 pages is rewarding but not worth the effort of the first 500.	2002-12-22
Not bad	But the isues raised have been better addressed, see \\"In the Heat of the Summer\\",. An interesting villain but nothing earth shaking.	2002-12-22
Good Hook	You stay with this for a long time, the premise is interesting.<br />About 4/5 of the way it lost me. The end is a big letdown.	2002-12-15
Juvenile Fantasies	Go out late at night when only the weirdos are out. All the women in your life are sexually aggressive and can't get enough of you. Let's do it under the bridge where the cannibals live. Your biggest fear is homosexual rape.<br />Too wordy, too far out to make you afraid.	2002-12-07
Believe the hype	A little slow getting started, like a roller coaster, then hang on. Get in line for your movie tickets. A fast, educational thrill ride.	2002-12-05
The power of sports	Conroy describes how sports, specifically basketball, was the saving grace of a damaged childhood. If you've read him before, you know about the &quot;Great Santini&quot;, who is more cruel than one can imagine. If you haven't, get introduced to the power of cruelty, even when your child is in college.<br />A fine work detailing the life of an athlete at a military college. But, he does protest too much concerning his lack of athletic talent.	2002-12-04
Wine and Key West	Well written page turner that, nevertheless, leaves the reader underwhelmed. Our hero should, with his history, be able to hear warning bells as soon as we do. Hoping for better next time.	2002-11-30
Can no one be trusted?	Lots of action, but stretches credibilty more than the last episode. Whit Mosley is an interesting character and is going to be fun to continue with. Pirates and betrayal enough for all.	2002-11-23
Remember	With newly available Russian sources, the author tells again the story of Germany's plan to open up more land for expansion. The horror that is detailed is must reading, though mind numbing. Read so it may never happen again.	2002-11-22
New packaging combines with new energy	A nifty new-style book cover and a focus on Milo are some of the rewards of this reinvigorated series. Stay with Milo and this could bode well for the future episodes. Bad guys with good action. But please, do something about the author's photo makeup. Keep 'em coming.	2002-11-18
Not the Best	New characters, different subject matter, but not up to the level the author usually hits.	2002-11-11
Burke Reconfigured	Reunited with his &quot;family&quot;, in New York, Burke looks different (more like the author), but the action is back. A welcome return to home turf has revived this series that had lost its way for a while.	2002-11-01
A new route	Good writing, a different kind of detective and brave plotting make this a keeper. A pleasure to find something new.	2002-10-19
Good One	The author scores in the second entry in what is hoped to be a great series. The characters, the Wyoming wilderness and a good story are the rewards of this one. Keep em coming. You know Tom Horn?	2002-10-11
Strong Characters	A standard police procedural with characterizations that hold the readers' interest long after the ending is known. Parker continues to refine and expand the police force he has created.	2002-10-11
A bodyguard's life is pretty slow...	so is this book. Being knowlegeable and sometimes interesting is not enough to carry this story, especially with an unsatisfactory ending. Better next time, I hope.	2002-09-28
Mission Impossible W/o the masks	If our hero is so competent, why is he always so messed up? About three quarters in, you grow tired of the double agents, and wish for some straight ahead story line.	2002-09-19
Unique	A murder, kidnap, revenge tale that is disturbing and nightmarish. You won't forget these characters.	2002-09-19
Wait for the movie	I bought this after seeing the preview for the movie version entitled \\"Trapped\\". I should have waited. An interesting premise degenerates into a beyond-belief soft-core-porn attempted rape and the story never recovers. Holes in the plot are big enough to land a plane in.	2002-09-11
Action	The characters are tough, the bad guys are evil, and you will have fun. Got to get the rest of his books.	2002-09-09
The best in snowy Buffalo	He's eating hot dogs again and killing the three stooges before the first chapter is over.<br />This is a freight train of a read. You can turn the pages, fast as you can read, because it's that compelling, or slow down and look in the box cars. This is like taking a class from the best professor you ever had, it's loaded with stuff, some subtle, some not.<br />If I didn't slow down, I would have missed the cannoli. Movies, mobsters,serial killers, crooked cops, Russian novels, Robert Parker, cars, moral development and Harvard professors, are just some of the elements.<br />At the finish, you congratulate yourself for seeing what you saw and wonder what you missed. This was fun.<br /> ...	2002-09-04
Boldt takes a back seat	New focus on other detectives and some truly suspenseful scenes highlight this new entry in the Boldt series. Some creepy characters show interest in Daphne Matthews and put her in serious danger ending in places we've never heard of. Good read.	2002-08-31
By the book police procedure	McGarrity may have solved his &quot;Jack Ryan problem&quot;. His hero promoted out of the action, grows closer to his son, a young Indian deputy, and numerous new characters are introduced. The procedure is detailed and the action a little short, but this is a fine addition to an outstanding series.	2002-08-17
Hooked on Page Six...	with the following line:<br />&quot; In a room full of victims, murderers look like gods.&quot;<br />In need of some judicious editing, nevertheless this is a disturbing piece of work. Some conventional twists are thrown in, most work and some are done like never before. A good one.<br />Action on par with the best.	2002-08-12
Past mindsets	Mosley with his precise, economical writing gives us a glimpse into the thoughts of a people we probably never knew. Always interesting, we solve a puzzle as Easy works his way, one person at a time, to the solution. Well done.	2002-08-09
Waste not a second	The info in the afterwood is more interesting than the whole book. Mindless psuedo-entertainment.	2002-08-06
Edit, edit, edit	Lose the paranoid bs, and you've got a readable adventure. This is way too wordy. How come a highly trained hero has to be saved by a novice, bumbling amateur?	2002-08-01
Read no further	Unless you need something to waste your time. If you went to great lengths to identify an individual at a murder scene, that has been captured in a photo, would you identify only one of the three? Implausible waste.	2002-07-28
Ready for a closeup	A page turner that reads like a script. A perfect travel/beach read.	2002-07-24
The places you'll go	The best Doc Ford yet, educates and inspires and the pages keep turning. A &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; twist allows Ford some self-examination in the heart of the Colombian jungle. Mixing fact and fiction, this is the strongest entry in the series. Keep up the good work. Headhunters and broken hearts.	2002-07-22
Overcoming disabilities	Characters that don't fit the usual mode and all too human at that, propel a different kind of action novel. Judicious editing might have helped, but this is a page turner none the less. I'll look for his other stuff.	2002-07-20
You're getting sleepy...	Blame it on mom, says the shrink, but don't blame me, if you waste time with this one.	2002-07-13
stolen ideas done poorly	The author may teach writing, but does not fashion any plot that holds the readers' attention. Stock characters and rehased plot.	2002-07-13
Damn, He's Good	The man makes me mark passages that stop me in my tracks and illustrate the power a writer can possess to capture detail, nuance and a moment.<br />For example:<br />\\"He lifted his chin and rubbed the whiskers on his throat,the cast in his green eyes as ancient and devoid of moral light as those in a prehistoric, scale-covered creature breaking from the egg.\\"<br />Or,<br />\\"A love affair with Louisiana is in some ways like falling in love with the whore of Babylon...our self-deprecating manner is a poor disguise for the realities that hover on the edges of one's vision like the dirty smudges on a family portrait.\\"<br />And,<br />\\"...I knew that for all of us who had been there the war would never be over and the real enemy was not ...but a violent creature who rose with me in the morning and lived quietly inside my skin, waiting for the proper moment to vent his rage upon the world.\\"<br />This entry mixes reality with devils and angels and you can accept the world created.	2002-07-06
Why the Kids?	It's well written and literate, but its passive protagonist and children as heroes/victims just don't engage the reader. Why are these kids wandering around the middle of an urban riot? How does our hero so easily find a child stolen by bikers, who really aren't so bad after all?	2002-06-30
No blue readers	This is everthing a thriller needs to be. Not as dense as &quot;Bad Lawyer&quot;, this makes you start looking for the author's next work. A very bad bad-guy and two interesting heroes keep you hooked, and the author supplies information right up to the last page. A good one.	2002-06-26
Good Story	Showing his knowledge of the system, the author has written a densely detailed story that gives readers a lot to work with. Good job.	2002-06-22
Plot by number	All the familiar conventions are here. You know the kicker well before it is revealed. Nothing really new, and yet it still hooks you. Mindless beach read.	2002-06-18
The best Reacher yet	This is a good one, placing our hero where you wouldn't expect him to be, behind scenes at the secret service. More a puzzle than an action episode, it is highly satisfying and will leave you wanting more.	2002-06-11
Interesting story needs better  tellling	The facts are worth learning about, but the story drags when it shouldn't.	2002-06-06
Strange	Wambaugh returns with a fascinating bad guy, a fire captain arsonist, but the story bogs down in trial transcripts and we  are left luke warm. Worth the read, but not up to the earlier works by the author.	2002-05-27
Miracles and Murder	Reading more like a story of the 30's than the 60's, this story dried up half way down the course. A father who performs miracles, a son who becomes an escaped murderer and the North Dakota landscape, are not enough to hold interest. Detailed prologue to climaxes, that lack detail and are no more than summaries of action, dilute an interesting effort.	2002-05-27
What readers pray for	The action starts on page one and you are caught up and not released until the last page. Sandford is at the top of his game. Lucas is tougher than ever and his opponent is talented, sympathetic and, at the same time, cold blooded and ruthless. Put aside your weekend plans, this will entertain you.	2002-05-20
Strong smooth structure	Perhaps the most confident and accomplished of Connelly's work. Hardly a false note in the whole story. Sometimes, in other of his works, you can almost feel the author bend the story to fit a preconceived notion of the plot. Not here. Harry journeys into the dark once more and may not come out.	2002-05-15
A letdown	A disappointing third entry in this series. A new character and good action in the first chapter and a big pause for the rest of the book. The villain and his motives are obvious long before our two heroes catch on. Let's hope for better the next time.	2002-05-09
Firing Blanks	The master of dialogue misfires this time out. A strangely passive protagonist mixes with civil war reenactors with little heat or passion.	2002-05-03
Timely	More decisive, suspenseful and action filled than the last entry in the series. An attack on New York is all too credible. A fun read.	2002-04-25
Early Work	The fact that most of the action, in this early work by Hunter, happens off stage is perhaps the most surprising thing about it. For an author, who is at the top of the action genre, this one is frustratingly restrained. But all of the elements he later masters are there- guns, assasins, heroes and villains, and haunted dreams of battles lost.	2002-04-13
Resignation to your fate	That's the overwhelming feeling that comes thru in this collection of a decade's worth of shorter works. These are shorter entries but overall more satisfying than some of the author's longer works, recently published. The man can write. Enjoy it.	2002-04-12
Good Collection	Some stories you've read, some forgotten, some never heard of before, are the rewards in this fine anthology. Take the time to enjoy this one.	2002-04-07
Slowing Down	Scudder is showing his age. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but takes some adjustment on the reader's part. Little action on Matt's part and the non-ending is a disappointment. Nevertheless, Block can hold your attention and has created a real character in this series.	2002-04-06
A Good Start	This 1st novel joins the serial killer genre with the paranormal, yet earns its real success with more basic writing. The author creates characters we really care about and when bad things happen, we take it personally. Well done all around, a few really dreadful moments, and I look foward to more.	2002-03-26
I'll pass	Some books just don't hook a reader. After 50 pages I was done with this Harold Robbins wanna be. Too many hard to take characters, money, and silly thoughts from passing characters did me in.	2002-03-19
Rising	The second Jack Delmas story is more assured and engaging, and a winner. Good characters, drawn well and an interesteing plot hold us to the end. Keep 'em coming.	2002-03-19
Good 1st effort	Good characterization holds your interest long after the plot unravels.	2002-03-11
Ponderous machine	At the beginning ,action every 100 pages, and boy do those pages drag. The plot is movie style convoluted and not close to reality based. How come we keep witnesses alive so long, when all that is intended is their demise?	2002-03-11
A Cool Reception	A talented writer goes thru the motions and leaves us unmoved and unsatisfied. A revisit to earlier places without most of the characters who made it interesting. I await the next work.	2002-03-08
Thorn returns	A revisit by an engaging hero and a meeting with characters from other books, mixed with straight ahead action, make this one enjoyable. Some notable holes in the plot will leave you wondering. What exploded and why in a crucial scene is never explained. But this was fun.	2002-03-02
Relevant	The issues raised are even more interesting post 9/11. Some interesting characters will make me look for earlier entries in this series.	2002-02-22
Lost interest	Though well written the plot lost my interest half way through. The story starts fast, but just begins to peter out. After the 13th chapter you can see exactly where this is all going.	2002-02-21
Preprogramed	It feels too much like a by the numbers plot. A villian among the good guys. Traitors to the cause. Way too much coincidence. We learn a little about computer history, but not much more.	2002-02-15
You can skim this	Don't think when reading. That will help get thru this shallow, TV grade plot. Even the Disney World finale doesn't redeem it.	2002-02-03
The end justifies the means???	Less implausible than the last entry, this episode is tighter written, having lost a couple of unnecessary characters from the earlier books. Good action. The author has created a protagonist with an unusual moral compass. Is keeping the blood off your own hands enough?? Very interesting.	2002-02-01
Good One	A hero and main characters that are three dimensional and realistic, make this an enjoyable read. Good atmosphere and nasty villians keep it moving. Bring on the next one.	2002-01-27
Wasting Time	Except for some pre-9-11 references to Afganistan, this book would lose continuity and plausibility and the readers' interest faster than it does now. Save your time.	2002-01-21
Chase this one down	New characters fuel the lastest work by a very talented author. We visit Buffalo again, as an avenger and killer play a deadly chess game across the country. You'll overlook the coincidences, because Perry has you hooked from the opening scenes. We always learn interesting facts, this time about the trade in stolen goods. Have fun.	2002-01-18
Big news conglomerate = bad	After much repeating, we get the message. More characters are less cartoonish than usual, and we do care about them, but we have less fun than usual. The hero-reporter has a mid-life crisis going, that's resolved by falling into the arms of a woman who could be his daughter. The story seemed to go through the motions without the passion of earlier works.	2002-01-14
Low Tide	After a great start, this ones slows to a crawl and gets tedious. The ending would work, if we believe all the characters are reasonable people, but they aren't. Strangely passive ending. I'll come back, but might not stay much longer.	2002-01-08
Wow	This book grabs the reader and makes you ask, what's happened since? The author has crafted the facts in such a way that the reader is immersed in the situation and the lives of the individuals on and around the reservation at the Little Big Horn. You find yourselve hoping against all odds for some of the kids to beat the odds. Some do. Some don't. A fine book that stays with you.	2002-01-07
Telling it like he saw it	The book reads like Andy sounds on tv. Unafraid to give opinions and unashamed to describe himself, sometimes unflatteringly, this is a useful addition to one's knowledge of the events of WWII.	2002-01-04
Smooth Writing	The style is engaging and enjoyable, but the plot takes a long time to travel a very short distance. The author makes it easy to read, but when we're done, it's not very satisfying. Looking foward to the next effort.	2001-12-31
Refreshing Start	A hero, who is all too human, sometimes inept and sometimes heroic, is a pleasant addition to the genre. The author knows Wyoming and is able to impart the texture of the country to the reader. Bring on the sequels.	2001-12-24
Smooth Sailing	The writing in this series is becoming leaner and more enjoyable. The plot this time is almost too lean. The promise of competent bad guys never is fufilled and the challenges easily overcome. But this is a trip still worth taking and echoes of Travis McGee are plentiful.	2001-12-22
Hangover	Crumley's hero Milo can out drink, drug and fornicate others decades younger. A story too long, with too many names and a &quot;drawing room&quot; conclusion that ends with a not unexpected disclosure, are still not enough reasons to ignore this very talented writer.	2001-12-20
A work of scholarship	Of little interest to the average reader, this work, while reflecting enormous work, does little to entice or offer anything we didn't already know.	2001-12-19
Huh?	Too tricky for its own good, this story never grabs hold of your emotion or wills you to suspend your disbelief. If you need a page turner to pass the time,this will do, but don't expect more.	2001-12-12
Back on track	The author is back to doing what he does best, giving us characters to care about. A little too much analysis between Alex and Milo, but when the action begins, the wait is worth it. The series has regained its zip.	2001-12-08
Style overwhelms substance	A style reminiscent of James Ellroy saps the reader's strength, only to be redeemed by outstanding action sequences. If the author can control the excess, the readers will follow. Some characters have vocabularies that do not fit the resumes. I'll come back for more.	2001-12-03
Adrenaline Junkie	The fate of the journalists in Afganistan this week should cause Junger to pause and reconsider his habit of playing with danger. In one of the articles compiled here he acknowledges the lure of danger for a certain type of person. He must certainly recognize, that he is a member of that fraternity. Always interesting, but in this case outpaced by current events, we learn new and interesting facts. How about a fire on the same day as the great Chicago fire that killed five times as many people.	2001-11-20
Color me happy	Another fine entry in the Kevin Kerney series. The author carries characters and plot from one book to another and rewards the loyal reader for paying attention. One wonders if the continuing promotions in rank will logically take Kerney out of the action, as happened to Jack Ryan. Bring back the maps.	2001-11-18
Ho Hum	Jesse Stone is drinking more, sleeping around without emotion and sleep walking through a not-so-mysterious death investigation. It feels like Parker has lost the touch for a compelling plot and characters that we can care about. Something is missing.	2001-11-14
Recipe	Take the following ingredients (among others); the continuing Swagger saga, add chain gang movies, real life gunmen (most recognizable, Audie Murphy), Western movies, Greek drama and myth,samurai,guns and more guns and lots of ammo.....and you have a page turner that will keep you up late at night. Keep em coming.Thank you, Mr. Hunter.	2001-11-08
Ouch	More lecture than normal, dulls the most recent entry to the Burke series. Too many interrupted sentences annoy more than enlighten. We always learn something new, this time about VA hospitals, but Burke obviously needs his &quot;family&quot; to fully recover from the pain of an assasination attempt.	2001-11-02
Good fun	The writer, who has obviously worked at creating a breezy, humorous style, has created a fun read. His hero is entertainingly dangerous and the dialogue sparkles. The ending is somewhat of a let down, but I'm going looking for his earlier efforts anyway.	2001-10-30
Desert Highway	This entry is like travel on a desert highway. The mountains are in the distance, the ending no surprise, but the changing vistas keep the trip interesting. Relationships and children are the focus of the tale and Kerney continues to grow. Not as much action as earlier books, but well worth the effort. One of the best reasons to get into McGarrity is the strong portrayal of secondary characters. Good job.	2001-10-20
Romance and heartbreak	Kearney finds romance and another officer finds his heart crushed in the worst nightmare possible. A fine episode, well written and filled with interesting secondary characters.<br />If you haven't seen the west in person, the writing in this series will draw vivid pictures, that will send you to the travel office.	2001-10-17
A giant with feet of clay	The best senator in Congress... and Clymer explains exactly why it is so. A flawed man, who by hard work and diligence, becomes an excellent representative and spokesman for the highest ideals of the republic. An outstanding biography, a story you need to know.	2001-10-12
A continuing pleasure	This series keeps geting better with each entry. The author is not afraid to let a bad guy get away, he'll come back later in the series, as we've already seen. The author can leave some questions unanswered, because he knows we'll be back for the next installment. A lot like life, we need to come back tomorrow and see how things turn out. Normally this would drive a reader crazy, but with McGarrity enough questions are answered to leaved the reader sated and happy to return.	2001-10-12
How to rope a reader	The second entry in this series shows that intimate knowledge of your subject, skillful writing, and a fine sense of place and history, can hook and entertain a reader. A hero, tough and competent, let's us follow the murderous plot to an old fashioned shoot out conclusion. Keep em coming.	2001-10-10
Finding a treasure	It's always fun to find an author, who makes you want to read the rest of his books. With so much dreck on the market, McGarrity delivers a highly readable first novel, that makes you start looking for the rest of the series. Hooray.	2001-10-05
Slippage comes home	Reading this book, this past week, just after 9/11/2001, was disturbing.<br />pg 47 &quot;with those foreign words, those terrible impacted images of the Tower and the burning caves beneath&quot;<br />Slippage occurs between worlds, along the borders. The authors could have been describing the feeling of the past two weeks when our reality has been altered.<br /> A good read, more judicious editing may have helped the pace, but all in all a welcome addition to the Dark Tower saga.	2001-09-25
Oh Hum	About a dozen chapters in, you'll flip to the end to see if your suspicions are correct. They are. New writer, old device.	2001-09-23
DOA	A comic book of a story. No character development. Unlikey relationships. Stupid villains. Read as fast as you can turn the page. Save your time.	2001-09-23
A Long Strange Trip	Although the ending is anticlimatic, especially to those familiar with Shirley Jackson and &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, this novel is a great trip. The characters, especially our hero, are multi-faceted and entertaining. Not a simple formula, paint by number effort. You will have an interesting time.	2001-09-09
Twice as long, twice as slow	Longer than usual, this entry has great action sequences but slows to a crawl at other times. Characters are introduced and then disappear for unexplained reasons. Not as good as the last entry and a long way to go before rivaling Travis McGee.	2001-09-03
Billy Bob Holland goes fishing in Montana...	And the line is cast and we are hooked quickly in another finely written mystery filled with dreams and haunted days. Like all of Burke's work there is depth, introspection and some self criticism. \\" I knew his words could not lessen his anger or ease his sense of betrayal. Eventually he would forgive (her), not at once, not by a conscious choice or arriving at a philosophical moment, but instead one day he would look back through the inverted telescope of time and see her as being possessed of the same moral frailties as himself and hence, in memory, an acceptable part of his life again. But that day would be a long time coming and these are notions you cannot impart to someone younger than yourself, particularly when the individual is your son.\\" Bikers, murderous rodeo clowns, mobsters, and child molesters are the villains and contrasted with beautiful Montana scenery to make this a great read.	2001-08-26
Hang on	This one is a roller coaster ride with a man at the top of his game at the controls. After the first chapter your disappointment that Elvis Cole and Joe Pike aren't around will be quickly forgotten. The premise is similar to many other books and movies, but the action never stops. Need a book for Labor Day weekend? Don't take this,if you want to anything other than read, you can't put it down. Thank you Mr. Crais	2001-08-17
Differences make interesting reading.	All fictional detectives have problems. Boejamin Justices drinks too much, shuns companionship, has ruined his own life, and is gay and tested HIV positive. Yet all this same, but different, makes the fine writing and interesting characterization easy to take. My only complaint will be solved with time, when old nazis get too old to be villlains. Good read.	2001-08-17
If Lecter played with explosives...	This is one possible result. The book is a grabber. You're into it and moving on a fast and enjoyable ride, much like a summer blockbuster movie. But when you stop to think, you realize how many holes are in the plot. Who keeps handing out phones the bad guy always calls? No one could drive in Boston at any speed, especially not as described in a beyond belief chase thru the Callahan Tunnel. The key to enjoying this one is- don't think, just go for a ride.	2001-08-12
Gritty	No real heroes here, but some tough characters, whose amorality overwhelms the reader. A fascinating start for a new author. The next one should be interesting.	2001-08-10
Sidekick	An interesting companion to some of the bios now appearing about John Ford. Carey first met Ford when his father worked with Ford in silent movies and grew up with Uncle Jack to have a movie career of his own. Some good behind the scene color to a man of prodigious talent and personality faults.	2001-08-07
On the road again	Reacher is back on the road and the series is much better off. Great action sequences are separated by good scenes and detail, that never the less, cry out for some editing. Reacher is tough enough, the writing needs to get leaner.  Great atmosphere, you'll burn under the Texas sun. Keep 'em coming.	2001-08-01
Joy, joy, joy	The Iliad, Six Days of the Condor, the Prizi's, the blues, Heart of Darkness, biblical recipes, Latin arguments, Vaschs, Buffalo winters, self effacing humor- are but a few of the fun references to be encountered in this fast, tough, highly enjoyable homage to the hard boiled detective novel. This with a real &quot;drawing room&quot; scene. You gotta love it. Now if they just resist temptation and film it as written, maybe get Danny Devito too, it will make a great, nasty B movie. Run out, buy it, read it.	2001-07-27
Derailed plot	Borrowing a premise from &quot;Trainman&quot;, Pearson moves away from his usual characters, and gives us a slow boring ride. Trying to make the bad guy good and populating his story with all the pc stereotypes sucks the life out of this one. Don't write a book a year, if its going to be mediocre.	2001-07-27
GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME	This is one great series. If you haven't had an opportunity to read White yet, start now. This entry has the usual players in a lean and fast paced adventure. Stealing a concept from John D.,White crafts an ending that speeds to retribution and makes us start looking for &quot;Shark River&quot;	2001-07-21
Out Stones Oliver	&quot;American Tabloid&quot; was edgy, dark and different. This is edgy and dark, but not so different any more. And it's long, really long. Extreme paranoia can get tiring and this does. I will still wait for the next piece from a very talented writer.	2001-07-17
Puzzle Driven	Interesting puzzles, gruesome murders and secret societies are not enough to save this thriller. The villian is identifiable way too early. The hero is an encyclopedia of trivia no one would know outside of the Vatican walls. Too many escapes and too few traffic jams in Rome.	2001-07-16
Superior Lake Tale	Krueger is at the top of his game with the third of his Cork O'Connor series. Relationships, greed and revenge power this story of a timber war, Indian casinos, and marriages. O'Connor's marriage is three dimensional and the characters are real life adults. A fine read.	2001-06-25
Angelic	Pullman has scored a masterful conclusion to his trilogy that is fascinating,even though a little slower paced than the previous chapters. Your questions will be answered and your attention rewarded. Well done.	2001-06-21
Is there a Kidd in Davenport's future?	Sandford teases his fans with the appearance of his major character from his second series while Davenport and his significant-other attempt to quiet the biological clock. The killer is mildly entertaining but the personal damage done by such an individual is the focus of this entry. Secondary characters are more interesting than this episode's monster.	2001-06-20
Is there a Kidd in Davenport's future?	Sandford teases his fans with the appearance of his major character from his second series while davenport and his significant-other attempt to quiet the biologigal clock. The killer is mildly entertaining but the personal damage done by such an individual is the focus of this entry. Secondary characters are more interesting than this episode's monster.	2001-06-20
Fading Memories	Though this story has been told before, never has it been more readable. This tale needs to be told before the participants become ghosts themselves. Stoic heroes have found a story teller worthy of the tale. You will not put this one down until you have ascertained the fate of the men written about in this suspense filled history lesson.	2001-06-11
Mr. Speaker	A fat readable biography of a man who stood for the little guy when it was needed. Perhaps the most fascinating tales are those from the start of his political career, when dead men could vote, often. He was not on the side of the Kennedys early on and those stories are enlightening. Massachusetts has been blest with giants in politics. Tip was one of the biggest.	2001-06-07
Facades, faith, fathers and fast cars	Parker is at the top of his game in this interesting tale of a scarred son hunting the killer of his adoptive father. Scars can be inside, as this young man painfully learns, and they can be far uglier than those acid burns he carries. A different pace and view for Parker and his best work in a while.	2001-06-04
Something a little bit different	An interesting read because of the subject matter, trains and bridges. We still have the FBI hunting a serial killer, but the bad guy is smart and really doesn't plan to hurt anyone, just the SOB railroads who have done him wrong. Too much time spent on a wacko army officer, detracts from the impact of the story. You'll enjoy the difference.	2001-05-31
Back from the Dead	After the last installment, &quot;Monster&quot;, this series was near death. But Kellerman has returned to basics and found an interesting family that keeps us hooked to his story. Secondary characters are strong, and at least one could have told a fascinating version from his own point of view. A good read.	2001-05-28
Good start for the long haul	A new addition to the PI list gives us some realism and a lot of the same old, same old. This PI goes out and works undercover at regular jobs to pay the bills. But then he falls for women who have trouble written all over them. Good writing with potential for the future.	2001-05-23
Good deal	Family history and introspection play a role in the lastest chapter of this series. Bad guys, boat chases and magical women are the more entertaining elements in this episode, but the writing and realistic adult approach are futher reasons to get into this series.	2001-05-21
What a business	A quick, entertaining memoir of Jimmy Wagner's short and adreneline soaked career as a New York PI. Famous people, good and bad, populate this fast paced tale.	2001-05-06
Rex Triumphant	Not your typical private dick. The story is not new, but the characters are like nothing seen before. The writing is excellent and the humor sly and enjoyable. The perfect antidote for the tired and overused plots and heroes of a lot of the new detective novels. Bring on the next chapter.	2001-04-30
Leaner but just as bloody	In this new incarnation, Slade (now father &amp; daughter), have crafted a leaner style but just as convoluted,as usual. Great history, as usual. And also as usual, the reader is weary of the twists and turns by the time of the last surprise. Slade shows no reservation with disposing of characters you figure would be around for a while, that is different.	2001-04-26
Great action swamped by implausibilty	I'm going to keep picking up Stewart's books because the pacing and style are becoming more polished. An absolutely riveting page turner that is killed by being too complicated. Keep it simple. A good book doesn't need three endings. How do all those bodies go undiscovered? Our hero figures out the complex and overlooks the obvious. Strangers divulge secrets and offer aid without motive. There's a great book coming and I will wait.	2001-04-22
Frozen	This historical novel makes good use of the author's experiences to give us a feel for the horrors of Korea. Closer to a memoir than a novel, its images will stay with you. Well done.	2001-04-18
Run for the money	An unusual plot for the series, still engaging but feeling a little out of type. Jane is chased more than running this time. Perhaps this marks the author as being a little used up with this character. Is this why he introduces new protaganists in his most recent effort? Not up to the high standards of the earlier work.	2001-04-17
Where we've never been	Truly enlightening look at a piece of history in Ethiopia and one family's journey to the modern day. Poverty, witchcraft, war and education play large roles is this story of the author's life. There are things we've never seen or heard of that educate us as to life on the Horn of Africa. An interesting companion to &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, that makes us reevaluate our place in the world.	2001-04-14
Spenser's All Stars	Lean to the point that it could be mistaken for a script, this entry in the series unites several of the good bad guys, that we have met before, to help our hero rid a town of bad bad guys. No one does smart dialogue like Parker and he doesn't disappoint. A very quick read.	2001-04-13
Surprise	One thousand years in the future following a great war, the people of earth have been moved around, &quot;shuffled&quot;. This story follows a group of fighter-priests-samurai in a walking tour of the old northeastern US. Plenty of action and new people move this story along. The end surprises due to a twist worthy of entry into the old &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; anthology. Alien reptiles have made a play to take over and the heroes infiltration of the alien ship will take you unprepared.	2001-04-12
Premonitions,Spooks and Action	A page-turning military mission in Bosnia that settles down after an awkward start and fills the remainder with action. Some Rambo like interludes with the locals annoy, but not bad for a first outing.	2001-04-07
The message is delivered	Set in the world of 1940's wartime radio, this is a worthwhile read. Though overlong, this spy-murder mystery alllows us a glimpse of a world just before our times. Most amazing is the speed at which a unique art industry grew, prospered and crashed. We are that much poorer and audio trash remains today.	2001-04-02
mishmash	At some point in this long novel King describes the dreamcatcher as a collection of things past, present and future. A perfect description for this work that references the real and fictional from the real world, his past work, and the movies. The best of his work allows us to identify with a character or situation. Only in one aspect, the plight of an accident injured character do we really believe. Mr. King has returned to the long involved works that we have loved in the past, but this time the story feels too drawn out, the alien too gray, the characters cartoonish. Bring on the next one.	2001-03-31
Let the water wash you clean	This author-attorney has created a not-so-nice, intelligent protaganist, who relies on brains more than brawn to solve the mystery of his not-so-nice brother's death. After a slow start the pace gets rolling and the last third of the book holds you to the end. Lots of action and realistic fight scenes mixed with a plausible puzzle reward the reader.	2001-03-17
Do run run	An entertaining page-turner without even a quotation mark to slow you down. A who's really who. Like a good Bruce Willis movie , don't think too much, keep moving and it's good bloody fun.	2001-03-10
A change of pace	The author's narrative device, using journals with minimal punctuation, captures a unique voice for a story that is out of the ordinary and worth the attention. Poverty and injustice know no borders and this is a look at Australia's version of oppression. Join the gang.	2001-03-06
This won't hurt.	There is a Steven Seagal movie &quot;based on&quot; this book about to arrive in theaters. The previews show explosions, car crashes, Matrix-like battles...the book does not.  However, the book is a powerhouse in its own right. Wambaugh-like writing, sometimes a little disjointed, is richly textured and obviously has a source in the real life experiences of the author or his friends. I will gladly pick up another work by the author, you should too.	2001-03-04
A Creaking Plot	The author gets a lot of his law right, but then wants us to believe that the DA does his own investigating, even doing a little b&amp;e on the side. Too much to buy.	2001-02-28
Lobster bisque	An easy read, but one that requires the reader be as slow as our hero to sustain real interest over the 400 pages.	2001-02-28
Enjoyable payoff	Perry is a pro, who like many others this year decides to opt for a change of characters. Walker and Stillman, whose names seem to describe their personalities, are pupil and teacher in this interesting thriller. (Echoes of John Sanford's computer thrillers) You will not be able to stop once you get to the last 100 pages.  Great descriptive writing- &quot;Seeing her pull clothes over that smooth, white body was like watching the moon being obscured by dark clouds&quot;, is just one of the rewards of this work. Have fun.	2001-02-18
No warning needed	A great book for travel, vacation or any time burner. A little info, pleasant characters and lots of action. Don't ask too many questions and it will sail right along.	2001-02-14
Hurt the one you love	Lehane has gone beyond noir to the river of despair. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. The characters, realistic and detailed, have so many problems that the book depresses more than it explores. The reader keeps wondering where Lehane stumbled onto this well of desperation. A talented writer, Lehane fascinates, but &quot;Wow&quot;, where did this come from?	2001-02-11
&quot; A genius between 'action' and 'cut' &quot;	This book is a brilliant recreation of the personality of a conflicted genius. Drunk, boor, loyal friend, egotist,poor father, generous benefactor, are all labels that could apply to John Ford. This biography verifies a lot of great stories and illuminates the secrets of the man. Any fan of film cannot afford to miss this work. Henry Fonda says Ford was &quot; a son of a bitch...but a genius.&quot; You will agree.	2001-02-05
character studies artist to explain  character	Recently several popular authors have created new characters and moved away from focusing on their original creations.(eg. Robert Parker, Robert Crais) Connelly takes three characters from earlier books and has them interact in this page-turner. We get a very different look at Harry Bosch in this mystery. Connelly's stories are getting smoother, with less heavy handed plotting, with each outing. His books are among the best of the genre being created today. Come into the dark.	2001-01-26
Smooth and sleek	Another addition to Hall's well written Florida thrillers. Things are not as they usually are. The FBI aren't heroes. The Travis McGee hunk is a slacker. The killer is no genius. And the heroine is slow on the uptake. But it all feels right and you can't put it down. Another A+ effort. Another look at the fertile Florida thriller scene.	2001-01-20
Strap yourself in..	This real-life pilot writes a page turning tecno-thriller that keeps your attention all the way through a good action-packed ending. Bio warfare combined with the plight of the Iraqi populace make for solid reading.	2001-01-16
Ticked off	A mix of reality and fantasy makes this a page turner. Some sloppy editing and an ending that feels like a handshake at the end of the third date detract from the desire to read the earlier episodes. But I'll probably give them a try. It is good to see Ozymandias Prather and his Oddities again. ( See the anthology &quot;Freak Show&quot;)	2001-01-13
Different view, same old same old	A writer with a different perspective falls into the same old plot devices. Too many cops willing to divulge information at the drop of a hat, a detective too willing to forgive a half naked woman who has just emptied a gun at him. Although witty,a story that carries little mystery or suspense, and too few believable situations.	2001-01-06
Big time sports	Great look at basketball played by real student athletes, who go to school to graduate and play ball. Great human interest mixed with games played with heart and emotion. Fans will be greatly pleased with this work.	2001-01-06
For your penance...	This one begins in an African village with a mass murderer confessing to a priest and telling him he intends to massacre the congregation.<br />Genocide, lives of the saints, con men, $250,000, hit men, lawyers and comedians are only some of the mix in Leonard's most recent offering.<br />No writer can more effectively entertain us, while showing we all pay for our sins. God bless a good writer.	2001-01-01
Just when you think you know...	Lost children, murderous mothers, hidden fathers, flying Texans, good witches, angels against the ultimate Authority, all make us wonder which side are we on. A sequel that more than matches the first part, and makes us rush to the third. What more can we ask for? Join the quest. This is great story telling that involves the nature of life itself.	2000-12-29
The measure of a mind	Stephen Hunter is a talented prolific novelist, who also writes insightful movie reviews. It's always interesting to see if you agree with the opinion of a writer you enjoy. But here Hunter has given us himself. There is an epilogue that appears out of place, until you understand just how willing Hunter is to invest himself in his writing.<br />Excellent and unforgetable.	2000-12-24
A Road Less Traveled	Most detective stories tell similar stories, deal with similar themes. You can travel in a Yugo or Cadillac and travel the same road, pass the same scenery, but in the Caddy you get a classier ride.<br />From the opening description of the state executioner: &quot;... his slight overbite paused above his coffee cup, as though he were waiting to speak, although he rarely engaged others in conversation.&quot;, we are in the hands of a master.<br />If you have not yet had the pleasure of getting into the heated lives of Burke's characters, climb in, for a ride with characters with history and depth.	2000-12-20
Debut page turner	Need to pass some time without too much heavy lifting- this is for you. Good action, not a lot of plausibility. A hero who seems able to do and know everything, while still being a sensitive family man,is the center of this first in a series.	2000-12-11
Beginnings	The first in a series involving a civil war veteran of Andersonville prison is an interesting history lesson of the start of organized police forces, this in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, the author, trying to be fair with the reader, gives too much away, too early. The next installments will be interesting to see.	2000-12-04
The unknown story	Fascinating history of those Jews who survived the Vilna ghetto and fought as partisans, sought revenge and fought the first war for Israel. The &quot;Plan&quot; for massive retaliation against the Nazis after the end of the war is news to many of us. The book presents stories that will enlighten, avoids moralizing, but forces us to look hard at the questions raised. You will remember this one.	2000-11-29
What's New Is Old	A fascinating history of the NY police that shows that there's nothing really new under the sun. Heroes, scandals, police brutality, riots and murder have been with us since the beginning. But if you think you've heard it all before, there's a couple of stories here that will surprise you.	2000-11-27
Popcorn	This page-turner is another chapter of Kidd and LuEllen. Reading this is like eating popcorn. Can't stop, goes fast, instant gratification. What more can you ask for? Bring on the next installment.	2000-11-27
Be Entertained	An attempt to reach a larger audience has produced a page turning adventure with more to come. Not what Simmons has done before, but an introduction to a versatile author for newcomers. He has done much better, but you will enjoy and we hope for more and better.	2000-11-23
Dark childhood	This is a haunting coming-of-age story set in Texas in the 1930's. Although it echoes of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, the monsters of this childhood are much more real. Scenes will stay in your dreams for a long time. Race relations, murder and youthful bravery are but some of the elements of this disturbing tale. Well done. (Caution- If you have read the author before you may have read a different, shorter version of the story about two years ago, but if you did revisit this work)	2000-11-23
Limit Your Intake	I try to read a poem a day, like taking vitamins or medicine. It's good for the mind and soul to allow one of these poems to wander thru your thoughts during the day. Do you know what putti are? Now I do. Thought-provoking simplicity is an enormous accomplisment.	2000-11-18
Innocence begins the journey	A child begins a journey without the usual parental guides. Trusting strangers until they betray her, Lyra embarks on an adventure that will lead at least to other worlds and certainly to self awareness and maturity. Surprising numbers of betrayals and tragedies make this a very different child's fantasy. I'm hooked.	2000-11-18
Rooked	The opening gambit of this game is as exciting as any thriller in the recent past. An airliner in distress is about to land and the tension is so well drawn that you will not be able to stop until the first 125 pages are read. But then we are teased with action sequences alternated with transcripts of meetings with people we don't need to know. The author takes time to slap those movie critics who didn't like the film made from his earlier work and generally looses focus. At the end both major players walk away from the game and declare a draw. This is a work that needs an editor, who could have maintained the thrill of the opening.	2000-11-12
Catch and Release	The story hooked me at about page 50, played me for about 100 more, and lost my real interest shortly thereafter. I stayed to see how it all played out, but it turned into a TV movie of the week. Interesting try but not a keeper.	2000-11-07
English perversions	A new detective with the burden of a murdered brother, attempts to solve the murders of five young women. An interesting and promising entry into the mass murderer field will keep you turning the pages towards a smashing finale.	2000-11-04
Sex and Politics	This story of the lady, who ran the most well known house of ill repute in New Orleans, is a fascinating look at a time gone by. Politicians, movie stars, cops and crooks come thru the door. Somewhat disjointed in the telling, we are held enthralled by this tale of not so innocent times. Good read.	2000-11-01
Hard Science- Tough Read	Hard science-fiction alows us to learn while we enjoy a good story. The science is here,the makings of a good story also. But the book never takes hold of the reader, never pulls one along for the ride. I learned about phages, retrovirus and genetics, but didn't have a lot of fun.	2000-10-26
Potter's Perils	More complex and more work to read than earlier installments, Book 4 shows the author's vision and will entice adult readers to stay for the next three books. An action-filled finish is indeed a new beginning in the battle against the dark arts. Good job.	2000-10-22
Read a good Kidd	An old friend has been murdered and Kidd enlists Luanne and a network of friends to mete out punishment. An interesting change of pace from Sandford's other novels gets a little slow in the middle,but contains enough off-beat information to keep a reader going. Good action and a different view point hooks us for more in the series.	2000-10-16
What do we think we know?	That's the question to ask when reading a book like this or A Night to Remember. Science makes us certain until it proves us wrong. Tragedy on a grand scale. You won't be able to forget some of the images. Picture a wall of debris that plows over a city. Good retelling of a story many of us had never been aware of before.	2000-10-13
Historic Duel	Fans of Stephen Hunter would not go wrong picking up this historical novel. The duel between the Nazi and the Russian drawn from the survivor's memoirs is highly readable. The horror of Stalingrad is captured for all to see. Good read.	2000-10-09
He who can...teaches	We glimpse the teacher King used to be, when he tries to explain how he does, what he does so well. Those students were lucky to have a teacher with passion. You will learn a lot about the writer and some about the man. One gets the feeling the autobiographic material was reduced by more than the suggested 10% in this second draft. The story of how he faced his demons could still be out there, but the privacy he desires is evident. You will be rewarded, whether you write or love to read. I discovered I was almost a character in Green Mile. Good job.	2000-10-08
Morphing	In this installment Burke moves closer in appearance to Vachss,after being ambushed early in the book. Is his perception changing? Rage as always been a key element to Burke/Vachss and this series continues to evolve. Less action than earlier chapters, but this is as informative and unusual as the others. This series is unlike anything out there.	2000-10-07
Fortune cookies and revolution	David Poyer, Tom Clancy and Stephen Coonts have made China this season's enemy du jour. This entry involves the least amount of military might, but does utilize a sci-fi robot to carry the day for the revolution that occurs, when big business can't take communism any more. Grafton's task this time is more personal, the rescue of his wife from a gangster. But it somehow seems too easy, though you won't find it hard to keep turning the pages.	2000-09-30
Do you have insurance?	The staff at this hospital may fall into one or more of the following categories: 1. serial killer 2. drug addict 3. martial arts expert 4. defendant unconvicted of murder 5. harvester and seller of human organs 6. killer of spouse 7. master of disguise 8. sadist.  A page turner that is not unlike a shallow pool. You'll keep reading long after you know who done it.	2000-09-22
Run for life	The second book of the Cork OConnor series fufills the promise of the  first. A story of parents and children, Native American heritage, murder  and a marathon with a life as a prize, makes the reader hope for more  installments in this very good offering. Get on the trek with Cork before  the boat gets swamped.	2000-09-18
Beach Reading	Craig's novels are easy reads, enjoyable characters, with realistic  solutions to most problems. JW is no superman and avoids violence as a real  person would, but can handle himself in a tight spot. Good local color.  Craig lives there and lets others sample the pleasures of the island.	2000-09-14
The Boring and the Draggin	And I like Tom Clancy, BUT. Too long, too repetitious,too little editing,  too many lectures, ...and yet you hang in to read about the new weapons and  details of war. Jack Ryan is only in an action scene because he does  something irresponsible. Who is left to be the enemy? The next one will be  fascinating or forgetable. We'll see.	2000-09-07
Bullies with FBI Backing	When Whitey Bulger and friends needed money or excitement, they would choose a likely victim, confront him with the story that they had been  hired to kill him, but he could buy the contract for $50,000 and stay  alive. These heroes were protected by the Boston FBI and that story is told  in this fascinating expansion of the story originally reported in the  Boston Globe.  This tale has resonance all over the US, anywhere the  government uses informants to further its goals, these are the dangers that  await. Good men gone astray, bad men made heroes and the rest of us pay the  price.	2000-08-31
A learning tool	Useful place to begin your collection. Teaches the history of movie  posters, lobby cards, press books, and other movie memorabilia. Can help  you not get taken.	2000-08-31
The truth as you see it	This collection of case histories of individuals freed by DNA  evidence,after being wrongly convicted, illustrates the weaknesses in our  judicial system. Pray you are never caught up in a situation where a  witness identifies you. A truly frightening evaluation of how we convict  people. Must reading for everyone.	2000-08-27
Needs a scapel	A talented writer who seems to have squeezed two books together. Oddly  disjointed. After a fast start, the book bogs down. Great atmosphere, but  less would have been more.	2000-08-24
Be amazed	Note the date of publication. Harris is the best at putting the detective into the mind of the murderer (tip of the hat to John D. and Truman  Capote). Will Graham is a more interesting creation than Clarice. A  frightening page-turner that is populated with damaged souls becoming...  You will not forget this one.	2000-08-17
Bolt The Door	What starts out as a burglary investigation leads to a page- turning tale of police corruption. As with his best stories, Pearson manages to teach us  something about science or technology in this lesson in communication. What  is said,not said, or should not be said, is as important as his  explaination of modern telecommunication techniques. This entry is a better  read than the last couple books.Pearson plays to his strength. Good to the  end. ( How come a smart cop will say something stupid to his wife?)	2000-08-17
No Mercy	Everything you ever wanted to know about the Crusades, but didn't know to ask. This work is filled with facts and trivia, that is fascinating in the  short term, but difficult to sustain the readers' interest over its length.  The narrative is much less engaging than the author's earlier work on  Custer. His research is to be commended. There was little virtue on either  side of these conflicts and we thank the Lord not to have been chosen to  participate. Sex and violence for the greater glory of ...?	2000-08-15
A powerful presence	Few actors filled the screen like Lancaster. His voice and physicality  were his trademarks. He changed the way Hollywood did business and stars  wielded their power.His social conscience was fascinaing to watch. This bio  provides a starting point for the interested fan, but many questions raised  by the author go without answers, evidence, supporting opinion or  verification. Lancaster chastised Kirk Douglas for his kiss and tell  writings, and perhaps that is a reason why at the end of this bio, we wish  for more.	2000-08-11
Running on empty	The fourth book in the Reacher series lacks the action, pacing and  plausibilty of the earlier novels. A careful reader sees the ending coming  long before one should. Like Reacher, the book feels burdened by house,  girlfriend and responsibility. Put him back on the road, before he stops  being as entertaining as he was in the earlier books.	2000-08-10
New eyes	This poetry clears the mind of clutter,allows us to observe the everyday  world with new eyes and even undress Emily Dickinson. A joy.	2000-08-10
Bullseye	Another page-turning chapter in the Swagger family saga is sure fire  summer fun. Earl Swagger returns from heroic WWII duty to confront the  demons in his past and the uncertain post war future. Hunter knows how to  tell a story and keeps getting leaner and meaner.	2000-08-06
Is Parker in the stretch?	It seems to take longer to pick up a Parker novel than it used to. No one  has a leaner writing style. Parker can say more with less words than  anyone, he is a master. But often I wonder if good guys might be more  verbose. The good guys always talk like Spenser. This chapter has less  inventiveness than one would like and ends with a scene not unlike the old  movies drawing-room conclusions. Just once,maybe more would be better.	2000-08-06
Expanding his reach	While not up to the level of his last Elvis Cole- Joe Pike adventure, this new creation allows Crais to go where he has not gone before. The best reads seem to be those that teach the reader something new. Crais educates  us about bomb makers, their sources and fetishes. A new female lead shows  that Crais is not stuck with one character. His focus in the last two books  hints that perhaps he is bored with Elvis, but he is never boring.	2000-07-30
It's nice to read him again.	Like the best of his subject's work, Hugh Merrill has fashioned a lean, direct biography of John D. MacDonald, creator of the Travis McGee series. The design and feel of the book transports the reader back to the age of  pulp fiction and early paperback originals. Fans of John D. will find all  the highlights of his career here. Gaps are filled in family background and  some insights are provided to the inner workings of the author's mind and  motivations.  This is not an exhaustive examination of his career but a  very good starting place. One wishes for some more details. How does the  non-athletic youth become the adult who on occasion has grabbed another by  the lapels, or broken up a fight outside Billie Holliday's dressing room?  Does research and work ethic enable a writer to so powerfully describe  casual violence and banality? John D. was a private man who obviously  guarded his feelings. Perhaps the real John D. is most visible in Travis  and Meyer.  An enlightening and informative, easy read that only makes one  appreciate and miss John D. even more.	2000-07-27
A Sense of Loss	If you have not read John D., don't start here. Find as many of his books as you can and grow, mature and enjoy the journey. Even before Travis McGee, Mac Donald had been recognized as a master. Stephen King, Carl Hiassen and scores of other writers and millions of fans are thankful for the time we spent under his spell. When your journey in time is done, read this. I did not read this until after his death. This essay made me recall the joy his writing could bring. With an economy of language, we are treated to a proof of the value of the well-read. I do miss him. I miss the anticipation of new work. I await the writer who can match his ability to teach something new while relying on the old values.	2000-03-25
&quot;A Perfect Storm&quot; of combat reporting	It is truly amazing that the author is able to allow the reader to follow a large roster of individuals through a maze of streets and days of horror. Ranks with the most readable of battle stories. A great read that stays  with you for a long time. It conveys several perspectives on a complex  situation and teaches us things we did not expect to learn.	2000-03-02
Cold hearts and callous acts	An ex-sheriff weighs choices concerning lovers and children, while investigating misdeeds and murders. A good read for an obvious series beginning. Interesting characters, location and information.	2000-01-01
Reconsideration	My initial disappointment with the ending has turned to puzzlement. Harris knows the bizarre and exposes his readers to unique and terrible atrocities, as he spins variations of the standard thriller.(The garbage  disposal in &quot;Black Sunday&quot; is an early example.) Our reaction to  the ending measures our ability to think outside the box. Even drugged, is  this how Clarice would slip into submission? Is she as strong as we  remember or has the Jodie Foster performance made more of Clarice than did  Harris? This is not the book we expected but Harris has always surprised  us. You will not be able to ignore this installment.<br />The monster is worth  contemplating. If Clarice can succumb, would we?	1999-12-23
