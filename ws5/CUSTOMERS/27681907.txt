Good, but too kind on Saudi Arabia	Inside the Kingdom : My Life in Saudi Arabia by Carmen Bin Ladin is a good book.  <br /> <br />But she does not even begin to honestly and completely describe how evil a nation Saudi Arabia is. <br /> <br />Saudi Arabia is anti American, anti woman, anti jew, etc. <br /> <br />Saudi Arabia supports terrorism and 9/11 was their gift to the world.  <br /> <br />I would have appreciated if she would have taken no quarter on the evil nation of Saudi Arabia.	2005-07-12

What more can you say about a woman who kisses Suha Arafat?	Hillary Clinton is a lying, conniving person.  That is how she got to the top.  What she lacks in morals, she makes up in sheer effort. <br />This book is a devastating account of Hilary.  It is not pretty, but it is the truth. <br /> <br />From kissing Mrs. Arafat after Suha said an inflammatory remark against the Israeli's, to a million other issues.  Hillary will do anything to get a vote. <br /> <br />Mrs. Arafat married an ugly evil man, she got a bank account of $400 million to do that. <br />Mrs. Clinton married an evil man, and got to be a Senator from New York. <br /> <br />Crazy stuff, but this book is required reading for every patriot.	2005-06-24

Evangelical Lie	If you want spiritual lessons From Napoleon Dynamite, DON'T BUT THIS BOOK. <br /> <br />It is simply a ploy for these evangelicals to sell their lies. <br /> <br />The publisher, Th1nk Books, sells gospel books.

Worthless, basic old anti-Semitism	Dissecting the Holocaust is just a new spin on anti-Semitism. <br /> <br />What's next, denying slavery in America, denying the Red Sox won the series in 2004. <br /> <br />Some call this a scholarly work, it is not scholarly, rather phony intellectualism, which is a pure lie.	2005-03-28

Completely one sided	Bethlehem Besieged is a very one-sided and biased view. <br /> <br />The author's premise is akin to a boy who kills both his parents and then asks the judge for mercy since he is an orphan. <br /> <br />Much of the calamity the people of Bethlehem face is due to their own shortsightedness and lack of true leadership.	2005-03-14
Great book	Israel in the World : Changing Lives Through Innovation is a powerful book in that it shows the power of a people. <br /> <br />It is ironic that Israel has grown from nothing in 1948 to be a world powerhouse in democracy, medicine, technology and much more. <br /> <br />On the other side, many feudal, monarchies in Africa have gone nowhere.

Flawed and one sided	Live from Palestine: International and Palestinian Direct Action Against the Occupation is quite similar to the book Bethlehem Besieged, in that it is a very one-sided and biased view of things happening in the middle east. <br /> <br />The author's premise is akin to a boy who kills both his parents and then asks the judge for mercy since he is an orphan. <br /> <br />Much of the calamity the people of Bethlehem and Palestine face is due to their own shortsightedness and lack of true leadership.	2005-03-14
Worthless	It is ironic, Nothing Sacred : The Truth About Judaism is nothing but lies. <br /> <br />Rushkoff's understanding of Judaism and scripture is hugely limited and flawed.  Not sure what his point is, save to say it is quite wron	2005-03-14

Powerful, required reading	Gabriel Schoenfeld is a great writer and makes excellent point in The Return of Anti-Semitism. <br /> <br />People think that Anti-Semitism is a discrete form of hate.  But the enemies of the Jews end up being enemies of freedom. <br /> <br />Think about it, the biggest enemies of Israel are the biggest enemies of freedom and democracy.  You do the math. <br /> <br />this is a brilliant book.	2005-03-11

Heroic tale of a daughter of a scumbag	what is so ironic about reading Dear Senator : A Memoir by the Daughter of Strom Thurmond, is how righteous and noble a woman Essie Mae Washington-Williams is, and how disgusting her father, Strom Thurmond was. <br /> <br />Washington-Williams is honorable, Thurmond, a complete hypocrite. <br /> <br />This is a great book.	2005-02-21

Hard to believe Conseco	Juiced : Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big by by Jose Canseco is interesting, but it is hard to know when he is honest, and when fiction starts.    If he REALLY wanted to come clean, he would not write a book to get $$$$.    What is worse now is that he is telling people that the use of steroids, in limited quantities is ok.  This is criminal!!!    Jose Canseco is so self-serving and can't be believed.	2005-02-21
Good for everyone prepping for the CISSP exam	The Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP Exam is a really good book for everyone prepping for the CISSP exam. <br /> <br />Notice that this is the Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP Exam.  There are others, but they are not 'official'.	2005-02-21

Brilliant book	Radical Islam and the American Left is a brilliant book. <br /> <br />This is required reading for every concerned American. <br /> <br />The book is kind to Islam, but points out many errors people make when thinking about Islam. <br /> <br />Many Muslims are good people, but far too many follow the radical Imams, which leads to the teach of tens of thousands of innocents.	2005-02-02

A must for every Linkin Park fan	From the Inside is a great look at the innards of one of the greatest bands ever, Linkin Park.	2005-01-20
Pure stupidity	This book is 100% farce, 100% unscientific and 110% garbage. <br /> <br />For those that are stupid enough to believe that there was a conspiracy to bring down the Twin Towers, you are unintelligent. <br /> <br />The only issue is how culpable is the CIA.  They were asleep at the wheel. <br /> <br />But what is more disconcerting is that there are people stupid enough not only to buy this book, but to believe it. <br /> <br />I read mine in the library, and would not pay a cent for this boo. <br />	2005-01-20
This book has something about sendmail for everyone	This book has something about sendmail for everyone. <br />I know sendmail very well, and have used it for years. <br /> <br />But even I and sendmail gurus I work with learned a lot. <br /> <br />this is a great book.	2005-01-20

Great info about the Riemann Zeta function	This is a great resource about the Riemann Zeta function.  A good chunk of the mathematics in this book is beyond me, but the value nevertheless was immense. <br /> <br />A great resource and important book.	2005-01-20
Fascinating book	Prime Obsession is a great book. <br /> <br />John Derbyshire does a great job of taking a most obscure mathematical topic and makes it not only interesting, but also readable.	2005-01-20
Riveting and Suspenseful!!	Angels & Demons is great, some of the best fiction in the past decade.	2005-01-20
Brilliant book	\\"The Plot Against America\\" is a remarkable and great book by Philip Roth. <br /> <br />Roth confirms himself as one of the greatest American writers. <br /> <br />\\"The Plot Against America\\" proves his genius. <br />	2005-01-20
Not Grisham's best, but still great	The Broker is not John Grisham's best novel, but it is great nonetheless. <br /> <br />The main character is Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison.  <br /> <br />Enter the CIA and the action starts. <br /> <br />Then other countries get involved. <br /> <br />I won't spoil the plot, but let me say it is a great read.  You won't be able to put this book down.	2005-01-18

Great book!	Someone else called 'A Passion for Trains' Poetry in motion, I would like to second that. <br /> <br />this is a great book, and makes a wonderful gift. I know firsthand.  I gave it to two people, and they both loved it.	2005-01-17
Grat book about the greatest ever	Stevie Ray Vaughan : Caught in the Crossfire is a great book!! <br /> <br />Bill Crawford is able to write about SRV in a way no others can.	2005-01-17
Good report, but nothing has changed	The irony of The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States is that after all is said and done, nothing has changed. <br /> <br />No one from the CIA has been fired, and if anything, the old boy network at the CIA remains strong. <br /> <br />Lord help us all.	2005-01-17
Good book, but Shakespeare is so overrated	William Shakespeare: The Complete Works is a good book, but excuse me for saying this, but Shakespeare is so overrated.<br /><br />If he tried to publish today, I doubt he could get a company to publish his works.<br /><br />The main question is:  Do we like Shakespeare because he was talented, or is it too PC to say he is overrated?	2005-01-17
Like a bully	Kill Your Idols is a childish book.  It is like a bully who picks on whomever they can. <br /> <br />They have a few cute points, but overall, the book is worthless.   <br /> <br />Who the heck is Jim Derogatis anyhow?	2005-01-17
Handy Tax guide	I have used the Ernst & Young Tax Guides since 1997 and have found them quite valuable.  There is a lot of good information that helps you find unknown deductions. <br /> <br />The book cost $17.00, but should easily save you hundreds if not thousands in various tax savings.	2005-01-17
Ok, but not much new	Witness: For the Prosecution of Scott Peterson by Amber Frey is at best, ok. <br /> <br />Amber's story is tragic.  But there are no insights here.	2005-01-16
Simon Singh is a great author!	Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe is a very interesting book. <br /> <br />Simon Singh is a Ph.d, but write for those of us without advanced degrees. <br /> <br />This book should win an award, very worth reading.	2005-01-16
You can't put this book down	In the Interest of Justice is a great book. <br /> <br />I just spent 4 hours on a delayed flight.  I am glad I had the book with me.  It is a very interesting book, especially for non-lawyers.	2005-01-16

What the??????????????	I read The Surrender : An Erotic Memoir and have absolutely no idea  what to make of it. <br /> <br />On one side, it is a great read. On the other side, the author is off.  I have never met the author, but it seems clear that she has issues.	2005-01-12
Wow, this is a great book!	C++ Coding Standards : 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices is awesome.  If you code in c++, you will wonder how you ever get along without the great advice in the book.	2005-01-07
Bad book by a bad president	In this book the former President chronicles many of the, \\"Good Times\\" in his life.  <br /> <br />I am sure he had many at the expense of the US taxpayers. <br /> <br />But Jimmy Carter should focus on the bad times of the lives that he has ruined.  He should focus on the enemies of democracy that he has long supported. <br /> <br />This is a poorly written book by one of the worst presidents ever.	2005-01-06
Great book!	this is a great book. <br /> <br />Murder in the Vatican is a sad tale of the sick Vatican, where horny priests run amock.	2005-01-05
Great reference	Linux iptables Pocket Reference is a great book. <br /> <br />there is a dearth of info on Linux iptables, and this pocket reference is a great book!!	2005-01-05
Excellent.	Even a Knoppix such as me learned a lot from this book. <br /> <br />Highly valuable!	2005-01-05
Great read.	This is another book that deals with the hypocrites in the Vatican. <br /> <br />People seems surprised when their hear of crimes in the Vatican, but this is an organization that supports and promotes priest who molest little boys. <br /> <br />The latest example of the lies and hypocrisy of the Vatican can be found with this week's tsunami.   <br /> <br />The official newspaper of the Vatican had a spurious and misleading report that falsely claimed the Israeli government had denied emergency relief for tsunami victims in Sri Lanka. <br /> <br />The official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano singled out Israeli leaders for declining the country's request for emergency help, when in fact the Israeli government's offer to provide a team of medical and security personnel was rejected by the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry.  However, Israel is providing an airlift of food and medical supplies to Sri Lanka. <br /> <br />Can you believe that?  The Vatican defends priest who are child molesters yet has the gall to falsely criticize Israel.	2004-12-31
Handy little book	Overall, a very good book. <br /> <br />At times, tries to be too much to too many. <br /> <br />But good info.	2004-12-31
Vatican is worse than the mafia!	At least the Mafia does not pick on little boys and sexually abuse them. <br /> <br />This book is non-fiction, but is as entertaining as fiction. <br /> <br />It is sad but true, and quite sickening.	2004-12-31
Great book!	Very readable and interesting. <br /> <br />The authors really know what they are talking about.	2004-12-31
Scary but true.	Once you know what goes on Inside the Vatican, as a Catholic, you may want to get out. <br /> <br />Methodist anyone?	2004-12-31
Great book.  AWESOME!!!!	This is a great book.  It blows the cover on the hypocrites in the Vatican.<br /><br />The latest example of the lies and hypocrisy of the Vatican can be found with this week's tsunami.<br /><br />The official newspaper of the Vatican had a spurious and misleading report that falsely claimed the Israeli government had denied emergency relief for tsunami victims in Sri Lanka.<br /><br />The official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano singled out Israeli leaders for declining the country's request for emergency help, when in fact the Israeli government's offer to provide a team of medical and security personnel was rejected by the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry.

The Vatican defends priest who are child molesters yet has the gall to falsely criticize Israel.<br /><br />Luigi Marinelli  should get the Novel prize for writing Shroud of Secrecy.	2004-12-31
Silly book	Hufschmid's idea that the WTC and Building 7 were demolished with explosives that were placed in the buildings in preparation for the 9-11 attack is absurd. <br /> <br />Yes, there are a lot of unanswered questions, but the idea that hundreds of people got together to put explosives in the WTC and Blgd. 7 months before the attack is ludicrous.   <br /> <br />I exchanged email with Hufschmid in December 2004 and when I started asking the Painful Question, he said he had no more time to communicate with me. <br /> <br />Hufschmid has an interesting thesis, but it does not hold weight.	2004-12-29
A stupid book	This is a stupid book, what more can I say. <br /> <br />the logic is flawed, the research is poor, and the conclusion downright wrong.	2004-12-28
this book deserves 50 stars	Bravo to Dore gold for showing what the UN really is:  Unnecessary. <br /> <br />From the buffoon Kofi Anan, to the myriad levels of bureaucracy, the UN has failed, and failed miserably. <br /> <br />There is no doubting it, Gold's book is a masterpiece.	2004-12-28
OK book about a very bad man.	Kofi Annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that.  Kofi Annan: The Peacekeeper is ironic in that Annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the UN, support for Arafar, etc. <br /> <br />Jeff Jacoby recently wrote that he is basically a symptom of UN's sickness.  Jacoby noted that just last week, Annan  woke up to a Wall Street Journal column by Glenn Harlan Reynolds, publisher of the influential InstaPundit website, urging that he be replaced by Vaclav Havel, the much-admired former president of the Czech Republic. <br /> <br />In The New York Times, op-ed eminence William Safire reviewed the revelations that link the massive oil-for-food scandal to Annan's own family: Until this year, his son Kojo was getting monthly payments from a firm that had a major oil-for-food contract with the UN -- even though he'd left the company in 1998. The corruption enveloping the UN will not begin to dissipate, Safire wrote, until Annan resigns, \\"having, through initial ineptitude and final obstructionism, brought dishonor on the Secretariat of the United Nations.\\" <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the latest National Review was out, with its cover photo of Annan and the headline, in large red letters: \\"You're Fired!\\" An editorial inside insisted that \\"Annan should either resign, if he is honorable, or be removed, if he is not,\\" while an essay by Nile Gardiner, a former aide to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, explained why \\"Kofi's hour is up.\\" With his record, Gardiner observed, \\"if Annan were the CEO of a Fortune 500 company . . . he would have been forced to resign months ago.\\" <br /> <br />On Wednesday came another call for Annan's ouster, this one from the chairman of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has amassed evidence that Saddam Hussein used stolen oil-for-food dollars to underwrite terrorism and suborn at least one senior UN official. It is \\"abundantly clear\\" that KofiAnnan should resign, Senator Norm Coleman said. \\"As long as Mr. Annan remains in charge, the world will never be able to learn the full extent of the bribes, kickbacks, and under-the-table payments that took place under the UN's collective nose.\\" <br /> <br />But odds are the world won't much care about getting to the bottom of the latest UN scandal. UN scandals rarely provoke lasting outrage. There was no global uproar when the brutal regime in Libya was chosen to chair the UN's Human Rights Commission. Nothing happened to the UN after its troops allowed Serbs to slaughter 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the \\"safe haven\\" of Srebrenica. Sex scandals seem to erupt wherever the UN goes -- the latest involves charges of rape, child abuse, and prostitution by UN personnel in the Congo -- but they never cause heads to roll in Turtle Bay. Annan himself became secretary general despite his failure, when he headed the UN's peacekeeping operations, to pay attention to warnings of genocide in Rwanda. <br /> <br />Why should anything be different this time? Oil-for-food may be the greatest international rip-off of modern times, it may have strengthened one of the world's bloodiest dictators, but if history is any guide, the scandal headlines will fade from view long before the secretary general does. By week's end, in fact, dozens of governments, including all the permanent members of the Security Council save the United States, had publicly rallied to Annan's support. Scandal or no scandal, he will almost certainly serve out the remaining two years of his term. <br /> <br />Which is just as well. Annan is merely a symptom of the UN's sickness, not the cause of it. His resignation would do nothing to reform the UN into the engine of peace and liberty its founders envisioned. Better that Annan remain in place as a symbol of UN fecklessness and failure, and a spur to those who can envision something better. <br /> <br />The UN is a corrupt institution, one that long ago squanderedwhatever moral legitimacy it had. The UN's founding documents venerate justice and human rights, but for the past 40 years, the organization has been dominated by a bloc of states -- essentially the Afro-Asian Third World -- most of whose governments routinely pervert justice and violate human rights. <br /> <br />Inside the United Nations, there is no difference between a dictatorship or a democracy: Each gets exactly one vote in the General Assembly. The reason the UN indulges vicious regimes like those in North Korea, Syria, and Cuba is that they are members in good standing, and most other governments lack the courage to cross them. The UN cannot be fixed unless that changes -- and that isn't going to change. <br /> <br />Kofi is a bad man.	2004-12-20

UN scandals rarely provoke lasting outrage. There was no global uproar when the brutal regime in Libya was chosen to chair the UN's Human Rights Commission. Nothing happened to the UN after its troops allowed Serbs to slaughter 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the \\"safe haven\\" of Srebrenica. Sex scandals seem to erupt wherever the UN goes -- the latest involves charges of rape, child abuse, and prostitution by UN personnel in the Congo -- but they never cause heads to roll in Turtle Bay. Annan himself became secretary general despite his failure, when he headed the UN's peacekeeping operations, to pay attention to warnings of genocide in Rwanda. <br /> <br />Why should anything be different this time? Oil-for-food may be the greatest international rip-off of modern times, it may have strengthened one of the world's bloodiest dictators, but if history is any guide, the scandal headlines will fade from view long before the secretary general does. By week's end, in fact, dozens of governments, including all the permanent members of the Security Council save the United States, had publicly rallied to Annan's support. Scandal or no scandal, he will almost certainly serve out the remaining two years of his term. <br /> <br />Which is just as well. Annan is merely a symptom of the UN's sickness, not the cause of it. His resignation would do nothing to reform the UN into the engine of peace and liberty its founders envisioned. Better that Annan remain in place as a symbol of UN fecklessness and failure, and a spur to those who can envision something better. <br /> <br />The UN is a corrupt institution, one that long ago squandered whatever moral legitimacy it had. The UN's founding documents venerate justice and human rights, but for the past 40 years, the organization has been dominated by a bloc of states -- essentially the Afro-Asian Third World -- most of whose governments routinely pervert justice and violate human rights. <br /> <br />Inside the United Nations, there is no difference between a dictatorship or a democracy: Each gets exactly one vote in the General Assembly. The reason the UN indulges vicious regimes like those in North Korea, Syria, and Cuba is that they are members in good standing, and most other governments lack the courage to cross them. The UN cannot be fixed unless that changes -- and that isn't going to change. <br /> <br />Kofi is a bad man.	2004-12-20
Poor research w/ an agenda	Palestine is melodramatic propaganda.<br /><br />It tows the PLO party line and does not provide any solutions.	2004-12-16
Great book	I am no Red Sox fan, but after reading Faithful, I really am glad that Sox won the 2004 series. <br /> <br />This is a very entertaining book.	2004-12-13
Sad but true	Conspiracy to Murder is a brilliant book. <br /> <br />It is both sad and disgusting that the world has turned its back on Rwanda.   <br /> <br />Recent events show how ironic things are.  Yassir Arafat kills thousands of innocents and he is branded a hero.  Yet hundreds of thousands of innocents die in Rwanda and no one cares. <br /> <br />This book should be read by anyone with a heart.	2004-12-13
Great book!	I read this on a 2-hour flight to miami. <br /> <br />Made the flight seem like 20 minutes. <br /> <br />Very good read!	2004-12-13

Silly book	And I still can't find those little aliens :) <br /> <br />Really, there is no conspiracy.  And there certainly ain't no extraterrestrial life.  The only mysteries of Ancient Egypt is why current Egypt is still so backwards.	2004-12-13
Fascinating book	Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief is a fascinating book.  Pacepa has insights that you will fine nowhere else. <br /> <br />One very interesting piece is where Pacepa relates a conversation in 1978 with Constantin Munteaunu, a general assigned to teach Arafat and the PLO techniques to deceive the West into granting the organization recognition.  <br /> <br />From this book, one finds out that Arafat was indeed a homosexual.  He cause of death was likely AIDS. <br /> <br />Here is an excerpt: <br /> <br />\\"I just called the microphone monitoring center to ask about the 'Fedayee,'\\" Arafat's code name, explained Munteaunu. \\"After the meeting with the Comrade, he went directly to the guest house and had dinner. At this very moment, the 'Fedayee' is in his bedroom making love to his bodyguard. The one I knew was his latest lover. He's playing tiger again. The officer monitoring his microphones connected me live with the bedroom, and the squawling almost broke my eardrums. Arafat was roaring like a tiger, and his lover yelping like a hyena.\\"  <br /> <br />Munteaunu continued: \\"I've never before seen so much cleverness, blood and filth all together in one man.\\" Munteaunu, wrote Pacepa, spent months pulling together secret reports from Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian intelligence agencies as well as Romanian files.  <br /> <br />\\"I used to think I knew just about everything there was to know about Rahman al-Qudwa,\\" Arafat's real name, \\"about the construction engineer who made a fortune in Kuwait, about the passionate collector of racing cars, about Abu Amman,\\" Arafat's nom de guerre, \\"and about my friend Yasser, with all his hysterics,\\" explained Munteaunu, handing Pacepa his final report on the PLO leader. \\"But I've got to admit that I didn't really know anything about him.\\"  <br /> <br />Pacepa wrote: \\"The report was indeed an incredible account of fanaticism, of devotion to his cause, of tangled oriental political maneuvers, of lies, of embezzled PLO fundsdeposited in Swiss banks, and of homosexual relationships, beginning with his teacher when he was a teen-ager and ending with his current bodyguards. After reading the report, I felt a compulsion to take a shower whenever I had been kissed by Arafat, or even just shaken his hand.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"If true, Arafat would have a great deal to conceal from his people and his murderously anti-homosexual supporters in the Islamic world,\\" writes Frum, suggesting that Arafat was airlifted to France for medical treatment because he \\"could trust the French to protect his intimate secret.	2004-12-08

Don't waste your money	Paris Hilton is not a bad person, she simply has nothing of value to add. <br /> <br />this book is sooo boring. <br /> <br />If you like Paris Hilton, you really must have a shallow and empty life.	2004-12-08

Garbage	There was no assassination of Senator Paul Wellstone. <br /> <br />As to the plane he was on, radar track and other evidence showed the flight crew failed to maintain an appropriate course and speed for the approach and did not properly configure the airplane at the start of the approach, making the later stages of the approach more difficult. During the last moments of the approach, the flight crew failed to monitor the airplane's airspeed and allowed it to decrease to a dangerously low level -- as low as about 50 knots below the company's recommended approach airspeed -- and to remain below the recommended approach airspeed for about 50 seconds. The flight crew failed to recognize that a stall was imminent, said the investigators, and then allowed the airplane to enter a stall from which they did not recover. <br /> <br />dont believe this nonsense.	2004-11-30
Great book!	If you are doing infosec policy dev., this book is aweseome! <br /> <br />It saved me 10 hours this week alone.	2004-11-25
Great read!	Frank Abagnale can teach us a lot about human nature. <br /> <br />this book is quite interesting. <br /> <br />but one never really understands what made abagnale tick.	2004-11-25
Findley's agenda gets in the way.	Why Paul Findley hates Israel is not clear.  What is clear is that he has written a book with lies from the Arab world. <br /> <br />The U.S.-Israeli Relationship is the only democratic relationship in the middle east.  Let's respect it, not attack it.	2004-11-25
Filled with distortions, lies and utter misrepresentations.	Judaism's Strange Gods, is written like Hoffman's other book `The Israeli Holocaust Against the Palestinians' with such lies and distortions, that it is humorous. <br /> <br />I came across a few of his books in a used bookstore.  There were about 50 copies of each book for 50 cents each.  And they were all overpriced. <br /> <br />The book is filled with distortions, lies and utter misrepresentations. <br /> <br />The book is filled with illogic ideas and a completely unscientific method. <br /> <br />In short, written by liars for a stupid reader.	2004-11-25
Fascinating and frightening	This book is quite interesting. <br /> <br />From disgusting horny Catholic priets who attacks little boys to gym coaches.. Salter discusses what every parent need to know to keep their child safe. <br /> <br />A book every person should read.	2004-11-25
Really good	Really good for anyone doing infosec policy dev. <br /> <br />this will save you a ton of time.	2004-11-25
Garbage!	Paul Findley is so utterly ignorant, it is mind blowing. <br /> <br />Israel is not perfect, but it is 100 times more democractic than any country within 1000 miles of its borders.	2004-11-24
An important book	Souad should have known that anyone who supports Arafat, supports the killing of innocent people. <br /> <br />So when her family decided she was the heretic, she found herself on the other end of a match and petrol. <br /> <br />this book should be read by anyone with a heart.   <br /> <br />It shows how backwards the mindset of the Palestinians are.	2004-11-24
Very interesting book - info about Arafat	This is a very interesting book.    The reader will see in a heartbeat the Yasir Arafat NEVER wanted peace.      Arafat could only succeed by hating Israel.  If he ever would make peace, he would have to do more than kill the innocents.  [...]	2004-11-15
Propaganda and a lousy thesis	If my eleventh grade son had written this book, I would have given it a D-.<br /><br />When Rashid Khalidi write it, it gets a triple F.<br /><br />The logic is not there, the facts are wrong.<br /><br />Can't Palestinians do more than hate Israelis?	2004-11-15
Bad book about a bad man	Said Aburish downplays much of the evil of Yasir Arafat. <br /> <br />At his core, Arafat is a terrorists and a murderer.  Arafat hates not only Israel, but the west. <br /> <br />Even if you are not pro-Israel, what people don't realize is that Yasir Arafat was killing American's way back in the 1960's and 1970's.   <br /> <br />He was responsible for the killing if US Ambassador Cleo Noel Jr. in 1973.	2004-11-10
Very good book about a very bad man	This is a very good book about a very bad man. <br /> <br />Even if you are not pro-Israel, what people don't realize is that Yasir Arafat was killing American's way back in the 1960's and 1970's.   <br /> <br />He was responsible for the killing if US Ambassador Cleo Noel Jr. in 1973. <br /> <br />Arafat is evil, pure evil.

Bad, bad science	When anyone can publish a book, they can publish anything.  This book proves that. <br /> <br />Sharks don't get heartburn, athlete's foot or jock itch.  So what? <br /> <br />This book is about bad science at its worst. <br /> <br />Also, sharks DO get cancer.	2004-11-01
Bad science	I bought this book used for 30 cents.  I overpaid. <br /> <br />there is no aids conspiracy. <br /> <br />There is no plot to create genocide. <br /> <br />this book is a waste.	2004-11-01

Chomsky hates America and Israel	I love reading Noam's books.  His blatant anti-America and anti-Israel sentiments are so obvious, that it is almost comical. <br /> <br />What I would suggest is that he goes to Gaza for a while.  They will not care about how he defends terrorists.  They will not care that he is anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian.   <br /> <br />Once they hear that he is an American Jew, they will rip him apart.  And that is the crux of the matter.  The inherent anti-American/Jewish feelings of the Arab world. <br /> <br />While he may try to defend terrorists, and condemn the US and Israel, when push comes to shove, it is a hatred of the Arab world for the west, plain and simple. <br /> <br />Noam can't defend that.  Nor does he try.  But he does skirt the issue.	2004-09-24
Tales of a liar	Living history should be called lying history. <br /> <br />Hillary, like her hubby Bill is a liar.  She like her hubby is consumed by her own ego and hubris.  Hill, like Bill, can't ever admit she is wrong.  Se always has an excuse. <br /> <br />If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend, buy is used, or get it from the library.  Why pay for it and have the liar get your money.	2004-09-21
A liar defends himself	This is a brilliant book about a huge liar. <br /> <br />Bill is a liar.  What else more is there to say. <br /> <br />Clinton is consumed by his own ego and hubris.  He can't ever admit he is wrong.  He always has an excuse and reason for his immoral ways. <br /> <br />If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend, buy is used, or get it from the library.  Why pay for it and have the liar get your money.	2004-09-21
Fascinating book	This book shows how dangerous Al-Queda was, and still is. <br /> <br />Read it if you are pro-Bush and you will be even more pro-Bush. <br />Read it if you are pro-Kerry and you will be pro-Bush. <br />	2004-09-07
Great book!	I read this book since I was so entertained by Singh's `Code Book'. <br /> <br />Fermat's Enigma is another excellent book of his.  Singh is a great writer and is one of the few that can take dry scientific subject and make them interesting. <br />	2004-09-07
honest book about making America great	this is a most honest book about making America great. <br /> <br />this book should be read by everyone, but most especially those who are left-wingers.  These left-wingers do not understand how important Mr. Bush is to America's safety.  If it were not for Pres. Bush, we would likely be dead or taking Arabic lessons now. <br />	2004-09-07
silly diet for tubby folks	If readers would exercise for 40-days, they would CERTAINLY lose weight.<br /><br />Yet people want the lazy way out.<br /><br />For those who have fatten themselves up over 20 years, they certainly will not lose the weight in 40 days.<br /><br />Listen friend - the best 3 pieces of diet advice are:<br /><br />1. exercise<br /><br />2. exercise<br /><br />3. exercise	2004-09-07
Very interesting book.	I was just on a 8-hour flight that turned into a 13-hour flight with delays. <br /> <br />I was able to read the Code Book in it entirely.  This is the only time I did not mind the delays, since it is such a interesting and captivating book. <br />	2004-09-07
Fascinating book	We all know that the French are rabidly anti-American pro-Arab, even if it means shooting themselves in the book. <br /> <br />This book shows why.  Sickeningly true and accurate. <br /> <br />	2004-09-07
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!1	This is a great account of the truth behind John Kerry's service, or should we say disservice. <br /> <br />Read this to know the truth, but more importantly, the lies about Mr. Kerry <br />	2004-08-22
Chomsky defends Arafat and others who kill innocent people	This is not a book about what is right and wrong in the Middle East, it is a memoir about a self-hating Jew.<br /><br />He feels that Israel has human rights violations and military aggression.  Far from it.  There are militant Palestinian's whose mantra is to eliminate Israel.  What are they to do?  Sit and wait for the bombers to kill innocent citizens.<br /><br />Israel is the greatest ally has in the Middle East.<br /><br />But Chomsky would rather ignore that and focus on the secondary issues.<br /><br />If Chomsky could get over his hatred of Judaism, he may be able to open his mind to the truth.	2004-08-22
100% garbage	Realize that Chomsky writes from his high chair of academia and knows not from the real world. <br /> <br />We live in a dangerous time.  Usama Bin-Ladin would love to topple the world and Chomsky sees America's fight against terrorism as an attempt to dominate the world. <br /> <br />The US is NOT trying to dominate it, rather to protect it. <br /> <br />There is no hegemony here, only defense. <br /> <br />Chomsky's drivel is not worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-22

A most important book	Jimmy Carter is perhaps the greatest enemy of democracy.  <br />If but 10% of the facts in this book is true, it would be a disgrace.  <BR>The truth is, it is all true.  Jimmy Carter has been on a one-man spree to support nearly every terrorist and dictator.<br />His profound love and support of Yasir Arafat is mind-boggling. <br />No one makes me more ashamed to be an American than Jimmy Carter.  This book should be read by everyone.	2004-06-07
Brilliant and insightful	Chomsky is a person so brilliant in theory, that he forgets the reality of dealing with people such as terrorists and tyrants.

Arafat is a murderer, nothing less.	This book paints far to nice a picture of Arafat.<br />That any American can be pro-Arafat is mind-boggling.  Arafat hates the West just a bit less then he hates Israel.<br />He has murdered thousands.  He is a despicable person and is in no way a legitimate political leader.	2004-04-27

Poor book	This is a book by a person who clearly has no real world experience in the word of digital forensic investigations.<br />While the information is relevant; it should not be used as an authoritative text.  <br />There are much better titles and this should be used as a text of last resort.	2004-03-15
A powerful book, required to read	The only problem I have with Vale of Tears is that it is classified as fiction.  <BR>The book is so true.<br />Most people do not understand the threat of militant Islam.

Gerald Kovacich great cut and paste book	This book had the potential to be great.  But in the end does not deliver.<br />About 40% of the book is Gerald Kovacich cutting and pasting from other books he and others have written.<br />I did not like the organization of the book, and felt it lacked direction.<br />The footnotes were repetitive often, and Kovacich is constantly footnoting and referencing other books he has written.	2003-11-12

How many times can Verton quote himself in his own book?	This book is far too melodramatic. <br />Also, Verton quotes himself left and right.  He used the word \\"I\\" a few hundred times too many.<br />He quotes and copies from his articles in magazines.<br />This book seems to be more of hype for himself than a serious look at things.<br />Don't read this book, it will only confuse the hell out of you.	2003-10-31
