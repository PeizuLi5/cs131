good read in a "Sex in the city" kind of way	reading this Book reminded me of watching a episode of \\"sex in the city\\". this Book is  a Light-Hearted read that will entertain you&also it has things that you have heard being mentioned before. it's a Good read.	2005-07-31
Very Entertaining	you need a Big Ole coffee table for this Book with the two Discs. the New Yorker is a interesting Magazine. the Cartoons make you think. there is a Elitist element involved with the drawings&Writing.still it's a worthwhile journey through the History of this Magazine. the Cartoons have always been interesting to say the least.80 years worth that is mind-blowing.	2005-07-31
interesting,sad&Manipulative	Karrine Steffans has a Sad story to share along with being interesting,but in the end it has alot of Maniplative elements at work here as well. the Names in all forms  of Entertainment are what sell the Book.Steffans is seen as a Sad figure but I don't ever feel sorry for her.I feel sad for Her childhood,but certain things that she allowed to go down don't bring any Sympathy from me.Hit&Miss Book.	2005-07-31

a Good Book	Charles Barkley is One of the Most Entertaining&Interesting Personalitys in not only in Sports but also on TV.I always enjoy His takes on TNN with Ernie Johnson&Kenny the Jet Smith. together With Washington Post&Pardon the Interruptions Michael Wilbon. I feel Charles Barkley has the right idea.Race is the Greatest Diease on the Planet&It needs to Be talked about far more until something happens that folks feels divides them.it's Ironic that Charles barkley has Ice Cube in this Book,because there was a time they were linked as being two of the Most Feared Black Men on the Planet because they Both spoke about what they felt. a very on point&Timely book.	2005-06-26
Powerful Book	Medger Evers was truly a Pioneer of Change. He died far too young at only age 37. this Book traces His speeches,writings&Letters at about bringing changes.He was One of the Most Important figures during the Civil Rights Movement.Much Respect to His Widow Myrlie Evers-Williams for sharing these Important Documents of History that speak of a Ugly chapter in America.this is a Must Read Book&Have Book.very Educational&a Book that reflects a time period that wasn't that long ago.	2005-06-26
Good Book&Props to Brother Michael Eric Dyson	I've always Been a Huge Fan of Brother Michael Eric Dyson.He is One of the Greatest Writers Ever to Me Personally.I dig How He Threads the Past to the Present&then gives you a Future vibe,but Yet makes it all work as if it all happen today.Bill Cosby is One of the Greatest Entertainers Ever period.for a Black Man to have His Longevity for as Long as He has&still Inspire something new in all Mediums speaks highly of the Cat.but Bill Cosby like alot of folks have selective memory on things.what He Objects to nowadays wasn't the Cosby from that 1969 Playboy Interview, the Cosby of those Classic Movies with Sydney Pottier.in fact in those 70's Movies with Pottier cosby was a Hustler,&Macking big time.much of what he diss's Today He was doing back in the day.and Fat Albert&The Gang was fun,but also played on many of the same things he likes to knock nowadays.70's Afro Era Cosby was more Kool-aid than Jello.but in the 80's He Morphed into a Smoothed Out Cat&Made the Cosby Show the Top Rated Show on NBC.it's always for folks to Speak on Matters when they have Access to so much than the Average,but instead of getting on a SoapBox go back to the Hood&do something.Cosby Works out in Hollywood&the Hollywood System loves to highlight the Hood&profit off it.that in itself is a Contradiction on his part because the very same place that He makes His Living always thrives through keeping Stereotypes alive.Martin Lawrence said it best about Bill Cosby: cosby had dissed Lawrence's Martin Show,but Lawrence said about Cosby:Quote Mr.Dad the Peacock of NBC still didn't give you Ownership of the Network despite bringing them alot of Bucks.what Bill Cosby fails to also See is that the same Folk He Bashes they have been some of His Biggest supporters.everybody has Contributed to His Wallet&that is something He should never forget.	2005-06-26
Great Book&the world Owes Him Big time	this Book is very Detailed&the world Owes Michael Jackson as does the Media a Big saying they are Sorry.He is One o fthe Greatest Musicians Ever. He has Broken down many barriers.Michael Jackson is a Civil Rights leader&Strogn Pressence that will never be denied.almost 40 year career.He is the King of Pop&this Book goes into many areas acknowledging His Genius&timeless Musical Qualitys.	2005-06-19
Horrible&very Loaded	MICHAEL JACKSON WON Clean Sweep!!!!!!!!!!!! the end of Nancy Grace&Her Hateful show&ways. you have to be Objective when you present news.now on the Personal Front I feel for Nancy Grace with the loss of Her Fiance,but the way she presents the news&the Loaded negative Bias that she has shown over the years I can't relate to Her at all.She is very heavy-Handed&Narrow Minded.this Book shows that side of Her&it's not good.for a very Nice Looking woman&A Smart Person:to Quote Fred G.Sanford She is One Big Dummy.	2005-06-19
Just Like Tom Sneddon:Bob Jones got Swept	always a Axe to grind&you can bet cash money that dude thought it was lights out for MJ upon writing this Book,but a funny thing Happen:NOT GUILTY all the way across the Board. so just how Tom Sneddon got Swept that is what Bob Jones is feeling now.MJ doesn't unload folks unless there is a strong reason.yeah the Book tells some interesting tells but How come you gotta wait until you think it's gonna be Lights up to Man up&Put this Book out? MJ ain't ran from nothing.Stacy Brown is also shady as well.get the Broom Out because all got SWEPT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2005-06-19
Great Book on Ole Blue Eyes	Frank Sinatra was a Man of many faces,but He had a Persona about Him that you would never soon forget.I've read so many books about him&this One truly captures another side of him.nothing changes my mind of Him as a Artist because I always say that you have to seperate the person from there craft they are two totally different beings.Sinatra is One of the Music Worlds Greatest Treasures period. Sinatra did His thing as He wanted to.like He sang\\"My Way\\"&He never strayed from that&You can always respect a stand up Cat.very interesting reading&Details.	2005-05-22
you gotta keep your Lady happy	the Ultimate Service with a smile because if you don't then there might be another pit stop to get it from. this Book is very detailed&gives all the right directions.scented candles,the right music,fresh smells in the air&everything else will be alright. a Must read.	2005-05-15
just Ok	I think Jill scott is Talented but much like Her Music this Poetry book is so predictable. nothing ever changes with her.funny how most songwriters Poetry Books are just average&this is the latest in that Line to me.	2005-04-24
a must have Book for a Baseball fan	Mel Allen truly made Baseball must see TV just for His Signature voice alone. I grew up watching this week in baseball which was always a Saturday must no matter what was going on.this Book also explores the hardship&various things that Mel Allen went through in his early Journey. He truly is one of the Spirits of Baseball as we know it.a Very Detailed Book that pays tribute to One of the Greatest voices in Sports History.	2005-04-17

Props to the King of the Courtroom	While the Justice system is still very bias when it comes to Race,I hate to think where it would be without Johnnie Cochran&His greatness in representing&His fight for Justice. He truly was a Strong Black Man who didn't back down&Made sure His presence was felt.not since Thurgood Marshall has a Black Man been such a force on the courts&truly made a difference that is timeless.RIP to MR.Johnnie	2005-04-03
Classic Book	I dig Elliott Kalb's Books big time. His Basketball Book was on point&This Baseball Book is another Winner. Barry Bonds is the Greatest Ever to me as well.Josh Gibson was so ahead of his time it ain't even funny. I enjoy how Elliott Kalb breaks things down&he makes you look at all the possiblitys.He is a very gifted writer&I dig how He challenges you on players.	2005-03-22

a must have book	RIp to Max Schmeling, who truly was a Class Act. His fights with Joe Louis were Legendary. He stood&Fought but also was a very respectful man who gave back&this Book goes a long way in detailing the many ways He impacted so many.a Must read.	2005-03-06
Great Book&A Must at all Schools	we are talking less than a Hundred Years ago which wasn't that long ago at all.we are only talking about almost 70 years back.it's scary to think that two of the Greatest Athletes Ever were treated so badly stateside. Joe Louis was a Great Champion& he did everything to distance himself from another Great Black Champion Jack Johnson because of the Politics&Hatered that went down.and the sad part Joe Louis still never was accepted. same thing with Jesse Owens.this brother won Medals&Faced Hitler face to face&didn't  back down.but Being the Best still only meant 2nd Class Citizenship in America.it's truly sad&they aren't ever given enough due now as we speak about the Greatest Atheletes Ever. personally what Jesse Owens accomplished in the face of Hate with Hitler was right there with Jackie Robinson&Larry Dolby breaking the Color Line in Baseball IMO. Joe Louis the Brown Bomber was one of a kind as well. just remember this wasn't that long ago.	2005-03-06
very good book	just got through reading this book&it fully challenges you&goes into so many different directions.it's a Book about a Cat who has it all,but also could be on the verge of losing it all&the choices He makes will determine his outcome. a very good read.	2005-03-06
Very Compelling Book	this Book truly captures the spirit of the times&the various relationships of a Woman coming into Her own. very Compelling&Detail that just covers so much base.the language,tone&Feel of this Book takes to you a whole different time period that truly was under a watchful eye of detail&perspective.One of those Books that has you hooked from start to finish.	2005-03-06
aside from the Snitching I give Jose Dap	I gotta take points from Jose Canseco for the Snitching,but everything else is on point. the Racist ways of Sports&Society nobody can deny that fact. the Politics involved&the way things are done&Dealt with. Jose is a trip.I don't care about what cats put in there system because Baseball has always been spotty.from the Segragation days until Jackie Robinson&Larry Dolby broke the Color Line in the game. the Spit Ball.everybody knows that Gaylord Perry&other Cats Scuffed the Ball&did whatever to get over.Cork bats&whatnot.it's always been anything goes as long as you don't get caught. everybody knew what was going on within the game.Bud Selig knew what was happening.it's for the short term for a long term solution.the Long Ball sells.Chicks dig the Long ball&The Long Ball keeps the Seats filled. I bet if Canseco got to 500 Home runs&got into the hall of Fame I doubt this book drops as soon as it did.I Think Jose was a Borderline Hall of Famer.had He had the Drive then he would have made it.I ain't madd at Him.as for taking Roids:hey the Man who Owns the Team only cares about Winning&you gotta do what you gotta do at all costs.as long as you don't hurt your ownself then anything goes.Tony Larusa knew what was going on&now He wants to talk double talk. ain't nothing new here it's just that the cat is out of the bag.but after a while it will be the same ole same ole.my only knock is the Snitchign factor.but in terms of everything else Jose was on point.the Game ain't changed that much or the Club mind set.	2005-02-20
Very compelling Book	One of the Books that upon reading it you feel like you are going into a whole different area&you feel what the writer is getting at. very Compelling&makes you see things fully.this Book will challenge you mentally.	2005-02-06
Good Book but a step off	the Book&story was on Point,but the Writer came up a bit short. Sugar Ray Robinson is One of the Greatest fighters ever. you can Name anyone in any Weight class&His Name deserves to be mentioned alongside anyone. alot of Good details&whatnot in the Book but the Writer is missing a beat here that keeps this Book from being Great. still worth reading.	2005-02-06
a Must read	fredrick Douglass was a Ground Breaking Pioneer who wanted to better himself. He truly overcame so much in such a short time to overcome the harsh Realitys of slavery.He taught Himself to read. RIP to Ossie Davis who always was a champion of Black History. a good start to the New reader of Fredrick Douglass.	2005-02-06
Hit&Miss decent but not the same	back in 1992 I was Hyped about having this book. but since that time Roling stone Music Reviews just don't mean the same to me as they once did. also this book is missing quite a few things. it's still cool to read&see what some of the Best Msuic Writers have to say on certain Artists&there Albums over the Years,but unlike back in 92 the feeling&vibe just ain't quite the same for me.	2005-02-06
Classic Book	the Buffalo Bills are my team no matter what.even through 4 Super Bowl Loses they will always be the Best football team to me.

Huge fan of the Godfather	and this Book  comes more direct than His previous Book. when I saw this book i had to get it.James Brown is Arguably the Most Influential Artist over the past 50 years.I Mean He is probably the only cat from head to Toe that other People have emulated.be it His Moves,His Mannerisms on stage, the way He presented himself. there is Only one James Brown&this Book does a Great job of balancing His incredible Journey.He is One of the Mount Rushmore's of Modern Music&culture as we know it.	2005-01-22

ok	Alicia Keys still ain't fully moved me as a artist on a whole.so reading the Lyrics in Poem Form doesn't sway me that much at all.much Like Jewel did with her Book of Poems something seems kinda emypt upon reading them all.they are ok but not a Book I want sitting on My Coffee Table.	2004-11-14
only in Hollywood	this Book is a trip but then again watching the Lakers&following them all of these years what else would you expect? all kinds of Drama on&Off the Court.I bet some of the Actors&Actress,Directors,etc... went to the old Forum&Now Staples to get some script ideas from.Greed,Sex,Drama,heroic performances,battle for Control&Power,etc.. this Book takes you directly there&More.what a Cast these Lakers have always been? the Book will keep your interest.	2004-11-07

Incredible	Wilt Chamberlin is a Incredible Talent in any sport&in any era.the Man forever changed the game. He is One of sports Mount Rushmore. Wilt&Shaq are my two all time favorite Players ever.Wilt though just was on a whole different level.truly a one of a kind force&Talent.this book deals with the many ways He Dominated the League.not only was he Strong,but He was a very athletic force Period.to be real he should be the NBA Logo when you think about His Impact&How He will always Loom over so many Players through the test of time with the NBA.	2004-11-07
Good Read	the thing that always stood out to me is what if this had have been Jordan's whole career? Imagine no Pippen or Phil Jackson,Horace Grant,Dennis Rodman to enhance His Skills&Depth as a Player? Jordan's Career in DC as a Player was Hit&Miss at best.He had some Great moments, but He also dealt with Reality such as Father time,making some suspect Moves for Players&also a interesting choice for a Coach in Doug Collins who pretty much was seen as Jordan's Puppet&treated as such by other players.the Book didn't shed much light apart from what I had already gathered about what the glaring problems were. a Good friend of Mine said it best abotu Jordan's time in DC: He was basically getting with Buddys&wanted to have fun as to Winning or improving anything.I wish Kobe Bryant had have taken heed to what Michael Jordan went through those two years in DC with the Wizards because that could happen to Him as well with playing with so-so Talent&Undersized Mentally&Physically. this is a Good read though.	2004-11-07
pretty good but not anything new	if you have followed the Lakers as I have over the years then you saw all of this coming.as Great as Kobe is,He just doesn't understand the Team concept&that unwillingness to  get that element of the game is what will keep Him from Being the Greatest Ever.He has all the Tools as a Player. now Shaq already has it,but the distractions&other elements made Him frustrated&rightfully so. already knew that Point about Devon George.that Guy could&should Be Something else but He just ain't motivated.Karl Malone was cool as was D-Fish&Rick Fox.the Pistons deserved to win,but if the Lakers had anything left after all of what was going down then the Lakers would have easily won that Series.if we weren't in the Internet Era then this Book would be truly a Must read. Phil Jackson is still the Best Coch in any Sport right now Period.I Mean to do what he has done for as long is Incredible Period.	2004-10-31
very interesting book	this book right off the bat had me thinking of Enron&other companys that got a bit greedy for there own good&when there is no balance&the Quest is all out there for Power&Grand wealth. I applaud how this Book tackles the Inner workings of Corperations&whatnot.it asks to balance Spirituality&have a Certain Upright Code within a business.very interesting book.	2004-10-24

an Institution like MTV	ESPN is to Sports Highlights like what MTV is to Music Video no matter how we feel overall. there are things about Espn like MTV from it's Hey day past that I will always dig,but I also have kinda tired of there commericalism ways that has watered down there network over time. it's had It's Highs&Lows over the years but regardless of where you stand with it you always watch it.	2004-09-19

a good Book	makes for a interesting read&how certain songs are selected at making the cut.I always enjoy Books that make you debate topics especially when it comes to Music.	2004-09-19
what a team&time?	though I'm a Yankee fan that Met team from 86 was something else&they should have been a Dynasty with all of the Talent they had. Doc Gooden should have been the Bob Gibson of His Era. just as Darryl Strawberry should have been where Barry Bonds is now.but so many side trips&things turned things upside down. just the way they beat the Boston Redsox's showed you that nothing would be normal for this bunch.but they never stopped believing in themselves.Mookie wilson,Ray Knight,Gary Carter,Keith hernandez,etc.. all came through in a big way.what a time period for baseball that was?	2004-09-06
Cool  Joe	before Joe Montana,&Now Tom Brandy had Quarterback cool there was Joe Namath. He truly was something else. operating on the Biggest stage in Pro sports in New York. His Guarented win against the Baltimore Colts is still the Ultimate Upset in Team sports.He had it all.very Gifted Athlete&also He was a Cat that people vibed with. a Winner all the way around the Horn.there have Been Ups&Down with Him in His Post Career but the Joe Namath I elect to reflect on was always cool&always a Winner.	2004-09-06
Very Much on Point	I always read the strips&this Book covers so much&speaks volumes on current events&themes. it would be so cool to Have Aaron Mcgruder&Michael Moore to colab on a Documentary Project. imagine the two Creative visions coming together? I always get to different takes on various subject matters&Points.once you start reading you can't stop.	2004-09-04
Good Book	another interesting Book with so many topics being mentioned&they are blended well here.the cover alone sold me on the Book. seeing Black Folks on Dollar signs always gets me.I still dig how I watched a Brian Hooks film where He had a Aretha Franklin Bill.

Great Book	back in the day I use to watch her show&notice certain techniques she would employ in the Kitchen when she was working up a dish or just the way she went about Making a Meal.long before Food Network&other folks came along with there skills in the Kitchen there was Julia Child She had a warm&Inviting manner at presenting Meals.RIP	2004-08-15
Space Moutain! WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!	Ric Flair was a big part of my youth no doubt.Me&My Homesboys thought we were the Four Horseman.we didn't need a JJ Dillon though.Ric with those Slaps&On Pint remarks back in the day were Classic.He just had that Larger than Life Personna&Swagger that Made Him Cool back in the day.His Matches were Classics.there were quite a Few Imitators but there will ever be One \\"NATURE BOY\\" Ric Flair will always be the Man in the Wrestling Ring.this Book has some Hit&Miss Moments no doubt but Ric's Legacy&the great times in reflecting on that rise above certain things.it's a Must for a Flair Fan.	2004-08-15
RIP to the Funk King	hearing about Rick's Death just blew me away. he was from the same howtown of Buffalo,NY as myself&I use to follow His career. the Brother was Funky&still to this day His songs are Sampled,Looped&parts are taken left&right.He was cool but also Down to earth. I dug How the Brother spoke His Mind. there aren't many people like that today especially in Showbusiness.as a Musician He was a Blend of many Musical stews.His Genius never got it's full due.MTv&Other spots tried to silence Him in alot of ways,but you couldn't keep the Brother down.this Book deals with His Material&also a overview of His Career.Rick gave so much back&meant so much to so many.RIP to a Bad Soul Brother!	2004-08-08
still the Ultimate Music Producer	Quincy Jones is still the Man when it comes to Producers.He has worked with the Cream of the croup over the years. but how He got there is even more amazing.the brother truly had to deal with alot of isms&still broke down barriers.His Mind for Creativity&channeling what works is still incredible after all of this time.this Book shows that no matter how tough&seemingly with not alot of hope insight that if you believe you can reach your goals that anything is possible.	2004-08-01
A Classic Book	this is one of those Books that you can't put down. you find yourself caught up in it&also with all the twists&turns you just don't have any idea how things shall end up.it truly captures the Mystery&pacing factory all at once. One of those Books that once you start reading it that you can't put down.	2004-07-25
Hit&Miss Book	there are things that I enjoyed about the Book such as the Spritual Journey reached,but the title&the way certain thing didn't flow as I'd hope they would throughout the book left me lost in spots.still it's a Interesting Book that makes you think&go over details.I guess you end up making up your own mind where you stand on it in the end.	2004-07-10
really good book	if you want action,money,etc.. this book provides it all.anything goes&Yet you are wonder what might happen next in certain parts of the Book.this is the Kind of Book that if Donald Trump was a Film Director He would try to create&Make.the Rich&The Powerful always make a Good Read at any cost.	2004-07-04
The Genius of Brando deserves Better	while this Book has some good intentions it doesn't reach the true Depth of the Genius that Marlon Brando was.the Book never fully reaches where it attempts to go.	2004-07-04
Bill is a Cool Cat,but nothng new here	Bill Clinton is still One of the coolest Cats on the Planet,but in terms of learning anything new or different it's pretty much the same ole same but with a Bulky Book.the Charm,Persona,vibe is all there but the Book doesn't take you anywhere really different than you have been with Him already.	2004-06-27
Classic	Blue Note Records not only released Classic Albums but also had Classic Album Covers that covered so much more.the Book displays the many images&stylings.if you get a chance watch the special on Blue Note Records which goes into full depth about the Music,Artists,Owners of the Label&those Classic album covers. enjoy.	2004-06-20
very detailed Book	there have been quite a few Recordings&Artists who have made Country Music.this Book fully details Albums,Songs,artists,backgrounds&overall stylings within the music itself. there are so many forms&Off shoots of country Music.it's a Styling all unto itself&this Book explores that&so much more.	2004-06-20
Truly one of the Deepest Cats	i always dig the way the Brother writes be it in this Book or when He is talking about things that happen back in the day or today.he has a way of tying things as one&making His point.this Book brings the flavor&Realness on the subject matter from start to finish.	2004-06-19
Pretty Good Book	I dig whenever Todd Boyd is on a Project because He has a way with words.this Book puts alot into Perspective&Bridges many a gap.I was hoping for more Pulling together of Hip-Hop with the NBA a bit more but overall this Book makes for a Pretty Good read.	2004-06-19
One of the Best Books on Boxing Ever	this was where you truly could appreciate the Greatness of Ralph Wiley.He knew His Boxing&the way He broke down each subject matter is Classic.Boxing has had many Fighters but you know the Guys that you still debate&talk about many years later.Great takes on Ali,HitMan hearns,Sugar Ray Leonard,Mike Tyson&Everyone else mentioned.A Knockout of a Book from start to finish.	2004-06-19
RIP To a Very Talented Brother	over the years I've Agreed&Disagreed with certain things Brother Wiley said but despite where I may have come down on certain things one thing never changed: the Brother was Bad with His.He made you think&Look.you had to question things&you had to Wonder the what if's.this Book continues in that vain of making you ponder the subject matters.another Good Book.RIP He left us way to soon but his words are will always be with us.	2004-06-19
very enjoyable Book	I always enjoy reading what other Players have to say about Other Players through out time&also who they personally feel are the Greats of the game&all the details involved.this Book is a Must for any Hoops fan from start to finish it's very detailed.cool Photos&Moments that you will never forget if you follow the game like myself.	2004-06-12
interesting Book on the Modern Day Musical Genius	this Book would have been even better if it didn't talk about R.kelly's Personal life so much in spots.but you take the good with the Bad with Every thing.still considering His Impact on Popular Music hard to believe this is only the first Main Book on Him.the Book takes parts from various sources&ties them together.nevertheless it has it's moments especially when you consider all the Brother has overcome.no Matter what I'll always champion the Musical Genius of this Cat because He is the real deal.hopefully there will be a Book that speaks on his Work solely in the Future.but this is pretty good when it focuse's on the most Important element of R.kelly:the Musician.	2004-06-12
A Special Player	He truly is a special Talent.this Guy is always up for any challenge&just gets better with time.I truyl feel when it's all said&DONE HE Will be the Greatest Ever.He already plays with the Greatest in Shaq but time will tell where Kobe will finish.but right Now He truly is on a Mission.	2004-06-12
A Rock Solid Read	Reading about Sammy Davis Jr is always a Must for me.the Man was not only a Multi-Talented Person but also a Soul Brother who had to deal with alot of Obstacles not that long ago.He held His own in the Rat Pack.He dealt with Racisim&Other forces working against Him&still made folks respect His hard Work as a Entertainer.the Author Wil Haygood explores so much&Brings many elements into the life of Sammy Davis Jr.very detailed book from start to finish.	2004-06-06
A Toast to the voice of the Lakers	Chick Hearn truly was one of a kind Broadcaster.He had a way of presenting the game&also vibing with the players. there is nobody else quite like Him. I feel His spirit is watching over the Lakers.D-Fish's Shot in San Antonio or Kareem Rush hitting those Big 3's in  Game 6 versus the Timberwolves.He touched many lives with His take on the game&overall vibe.RIP to a Great Talent&down to earth Man.	2004-06-06

Hit&Miss	nothing new here.I think Kim Dulaney is a Talented Writer but this Book has to many cliches to it.everybody who reads the Book knows who the main subject is.now had she went into a different direction&had a fuller take with the Book then this Book would have been more interesting.	2004-05-30

really cool exchanges	this Book has alot of Cool Quotes,Interviews&takes on things from different Artists&makes for a Fun Read.there is nothing like hearing different Musicians reflect on things.	2003-04-28
average but at least the Guy wrote on Prince	to be honest there are only a handful of Books on Prince that are even halfway interesting.I give the Author Props for taking the time to write on a Cat that while is a Musical Genius,Legend&One of the Greatest Artists in Studio&Live of All-Time, has also for quite a while been a Has-Been&Hit-Less.if it wasn't for the fact that Prince can still Hang with anyone Live on Stage He would be basically Be written off.this Book doesn't balance Prince the Artists enough&His work as it does digging into Prince's Life&whatnot.nothing new here.I give the Author Props for writing on Prince because unlike 20-15&even 10 Years back I don't see the long line to get a Book out on Him.I agree with the title from the Commerical Prime&Peak Situation&also everybody who blows up also takes a dive with a New Genration&Era of Musicial Ears.Prince these days is in the same boat as Michael Jackson minus the Issues even though MJ can still Pull some Hits&Hit with a Album but Image has taken a Major beating&also these Cats played a different brand of the Music Game.but anyway at least somebody still cares to write on Prince? I still dig His Old Stuff&always will.the Best Book on Prince though is Per Nilsen's \\"DMSR\\" the first Decade 78-88 when prince truly Mattered&reached His full Music Zenith for Me&My Ears.	2003-04-13
Good read	Before Shaq became the truly unstoppable Force He is now&has been for the past few years He was New on the NBA Scene&dealing with the Highest level of play&going through changes as a Player&whatnot.this book is a friendly reminder of How far He has truly come&He is One of the Greatest Players Ever&still has a chance to Be Proclaimed the Greatest Ever if He keeps Winning titles&stays Healthy.Shaq is a One of a Kind Dynamic Force in the NBA Today.	2003-04-09

A Real Good Start on Malcolm X's Life	if you haven't read Malcolm X's Autobio with Alex Hailey then this is a Must read to starting out with His work.this Book goes over different details of His Life,upbringing&outlook on the world at the time.a Real Good Book on a Very Important&Influential American Figure that Forever Changed the Way History would be mentioned&go Down.	2003-03-18
Good Book	I'd given Wells more Props if He hadn't backed away from How He truly felt.this Book gives a inside Glimpse into the Baddest Baseball Team&it's Players.David Wells is just what Sports needs&any form of Entertainment because to many Folks are standing in front of the Camera Saying what they think other people want to hear as to being themselves&I give Wells Props for that.I don't always agree with Him but I respect Him for calling the Game like He sees it.I just wish He would have stayed within the Count He was Bringing off the Mound.	2003-03-18
A ... Book	read this Book at a local Book Store&thought wow another Journalist went to school to write trashy pieces on Michael Jackson?this Book like alot of the other Negative slant you read on MJ is truly meant for the trash cans.a quick cash in is what is allowed of a Great Artist like Michael Jackson&that truly is wrong in my eyes.things have gotten way overblown.	2003-03-12
A Good Book on Mr.October	Reggie Jackson in His Prime was like Dion Sanders,Barry Bonds&Shaq all rolled into One.He was unstoppable when it was money time&He truly was a one of a kind Personality.wherever He went He was a Winner.Reggie was something else.this is a good book that spotlights one of Baseball's Greatest's Talents Ever.	2003-03-12
Good Book	I really enjoyed this Book&enjoyed the thoughts that Joe DiMaggio was feeling on various topics through the years.this Book does a real good of that.I find all Books on Joe to Be interesting.He was One of the Greatest Baseball Players Ever&A Interesting Person off the Field as well.	2003-03-04
fairly weak	considering the Subject matter i expected more details than some things that were long ago known.this Book feels more like a copy&Paste.Donna Summer is a Foxy lady&Has Made some Very Important Music&this Book doesn't capture that at all for me.looking for Her Book later this year.	2003-02-24
cool to remember	it's really Cool remembering Greatness in it's early stages.Kobe Bryant has gotten better&better with each passing season&you are seeing a Guy that is truly gonna Leave His Mark on the Game before His Day is done.Kobe Bryant Is one of the Baddest Players in the League Today&The Guy is a Champion&He had a Dream at being the Best He could&the scary part we haven't even got to His Prime&Peak.Stay Tune for Number #8.	2003-02-23
The Man is Deep	He is truly One of the Greatest Writers that I have Ever Read on.Brother Dyson has a way with words&bringing so much Groove in His Presentation.I truly applaud the way He tackles so many subjects&never misses a beat.He is a Deep Cat&always someone you have to Read a Couple of times to fully Digest His Knowledge&Wide Scope of things going on.	2003-02-15
fairly basic	this book didn't add anything into Barry Manilow's Career.it stopped at a certain point&was stuck there.it has some interesting blurbs but overall very tabloid in a lot of ways to me.it only goes to the Early 80's with Barry.He needs a new Book on His Career especailly after His Monster Year of 2002.	2003-02-04
a Strogn Book	I really enjoyed reading on Zora Neale Hurston. Valerie Boyd did a Great job capturing Her Work&Being in this Book.a very top notch taking Here by Valerie Boyd.this Book takes you a journey.	2003-02-03
very Real	I couldn't put this Book down it dealt with so many subjects&Challenged the Reader into thinking of so thoughts within the Context of Race&class.I Applaud the Author for the Direct Honesty&letting everything hang out&Open.it's a strong testimony of Her Overcoming&dealing with the Cards She was dealt with in Life&finding Her place&Voice in this Society.	2003-02-02
Good Book	I always enjoy reading Books on Larry Bird.He is truly one of the Greatest Basketball Players that I have ever seen play.His Mind for Play&detail is showcased rather well here.	2003-01-29
must have as a fan&Musician	this is a cool Book that gives a overview within the structuring of many the Bee Gee's songs.you can see the Paino Parts&Hooks&bridges too various tracks they did over the years.I've always dug there Rhythm&Timing on there tracks.they understood Hooks really well.and one of the things they don't get enough credit for is being able too Groove during the Disco Era when many acts were just pushing Buttons these Cats could strip down the Groove.	2003-01-22
one of the few Honest REF's	I'm not crazy about most Pro Ref's in any sport but Jerry Markbreit is one of the few that I always respected the way He called a game.nothing out of the ordinary  when He was ref of a Game or a big game.I enjoyed the way He takes you too the field.	2003-01-20

Hit&Miss	the title alone makes the book more interesting than what comes out overall.while the Book offers some interestign details on certain topics like alot of other readers too much time is spent on Diana Ross&Not enough on the music itself.still it has some moments.	2003-01-20

nothing like College Basketball	so many incredible Players have come through the College ranks.somehow saying that seems like another time period because more&more Kids are going straight too the Pros.but this Book reflects when alot of Guys made a name for themselves in the COllege ranks&leaped off of that.this Book has great reflections.for the Basketball fan especially the College Fan this is a must have.	2003-01-20

Another Great Book on Miles	not many Artists are that interesting where you want too read any book you see on them.but Miles Davis was not just any other Cat.the Man changed the way Music was heard&had a style in Hsi Playing&Leading His Band that made him one of the cornerstones.this Book takes on the Man,Myths,Music,times&raps it all together as on.I'd say the book is very fair overall in speaking on him as a Artist&a human being.when you read one Book on Miles you will want 21 more just like it because that is the vibe Miles has on you once you are hooked on His Genius.	2003-01-16
Great Book on this Laker Run	last year really was something else.it felt so good seeing the Lakers 3-Peat.Shaq,Kobe&Crew were something else.Phil Jackson turned things up another notch.it's fantastic too see the pictures&reflect on this Great run.3-Peat is a Wonderful thing.going for more this year&beyond.	2003-01-15

just there	while Toure has some interesting ideas I find His writing style too be very boring&just kinda there.I think He is a Very Overrated Writer.He was kinda Lame at Rolling Stone&now with a Book which while being cleaver at times basically just says the same thing over&over.	2002-11-24
real interesting Book	there was a time when SNL was on the Cutting edge of TV.but those days have long past&too be honest the plug on the Show should have been pulled at least 11-12 years back.but in it's early days it set the standards for shows like In Living Color\\"&what you see with \\"Madd TV\\" among other shows.I always wondered why the Show had so few African-American Cast Members over the years?Eddie Murphy is Missing something badly in here for me.of course you would want too hear Eddie Murphy reflect on the show.interesting stories on John Belushi.He was something else.this book deals with alot of various topics.	2002-11-24
Very Timely Book	this Book unfolds a Not so Hidden Ugly Case of Racism.this book brings so many things to life about the Red Sox's.I think this Book also Explains one of the Reasons why they have been Cursed so Long from Winning it all.there has to be A Omen that still haunts them for how they have Treated there Black Athletes through the Years.Bill Russell Alone should have the City Named Half in His Name to me.this Book was very well written&on time.	2002-10-07

Another Powerful Read on Marvin Gaye	Marvin Gaye not only was a musical Genius but the Cat was just very down to earth.reading on Him has always been interesting to me because the Guy was very Complex&so many things went down.His Battle with Motown over His Artistic Direction,Berry Gordy,Marvin&His Wives,His Mother&His Father.so many things involved.this Book takes on all of that&was very well Written.	2002-09-29
very detailed Book	I got this Book a few Years back&truly dug how Adrian Grant went into Detail on MJ's Music.He mentioned when tracks were done&also mentioned side tidbits that were cool as well.very good comprehensive overview on one of the Greatest Music Artists Ever.He mentioned this song called \\"Buffalo Bill\\" that Michael Jackson had done&I was like I wish I could have heard it? that was cool of Him to drop Songs&things.alot of folks don't know how detailed MJ is in the studio or the fact He records so much.	2002-09-29
Great Book that covers History	now this is the kind of Book that I call must reading because it covers a Form of Music&the People that molded&brought it to Life in a Rich Classy way.it explores so many areas&brings it all back to home without missing a beat.this Book is a History Lesson on so many things.Jazz is a Wide range topic all onto itself&this Book Explores that&so much more.	2002-09-28
Power Book	this Summer has been one story after another about Kids being taken away&this Book Reminded me of a very sad&troubled time period.I Remember wondering if what was happening in Atlanta could happen or would happen where I was living?things like that never leave you especially growing up as a Black Youngster.Tayari Jones brings so much out&more in this book.Incredible Presentation&strong Inside.One of the Best Books I've read over the past few years.	2002-09-07
very interesting Book	a very interesting take&structure within this book.a Book that has alot of details on Spirituality.	2002-09-07
very stunning book	this is the kind of book that once you start reading it you can't put it down because it speaks the Gospel truth on things.the book in so many ways reminds of you are getting to big for your britches.or have you forgotten who you are?I truly enjoy Her Showcasing Her Intelligence for something more&greater to me still in this Society there is nothing more Dangerous than a Black Person that happens to Be Smart&On the Ball.throw Success into the Mix&\\"Haters\\" both Black&White are Scared.but for different reasons.I enjoyed this Book fully.	2002-09-07

Enjoyed this Book	I really found this Book to be quite interesting.I found Censorship to be a Joke overall to me.Shops still Sell Stickered Albums to Kids all over the World.what do they stop?? I think it was Racist that Prince was Made the \\"Poster Child\\" for Content in Music back in 1985.Suggestive Material had been around way Before Prince&others Came along but He got the Tag.Rappers have caught more Flack Behind Censorship as well.interestign Book Nevertheless.	2002-06-25

His Name is Barry Bonds: the Baddest Cat in the Game	finally a Book on My Favoirte Baseball Player in the Game.Barry Bonds gets a Bad Rap for Reasons that have nothing to do with what He does on the Field.He won't Smile&Shuck like so Many Other Atheletes feel they must do to be excepted.Barry Bonds Smiles with His Talent&Shines with it.Barry is the Best Example of how it's suppose to be.because to have a Year liek He did last year means Hard Work&Determination.He is a 5 Tool Player:Run,hit,Power,Glove,All-Around Force.the only other Player I see in Baseball on His Level is Alex Rodriguez.Barry is long overdue for His Due as a Great Player that Arguably Might One Day be Considered the Greatest.when you factor Hwo Dangerous He is&the way He gets Walked not many other Players can Make Claim to that.a Book for a Sports Fan that Respects Talent first&foremost.	2002-04-25
Very Interesting 80's Book	this is a very interesting Book on 80's Pop Culture.the 80's were a Interesting Era&the Last time Period of Concept still mattering.for better or for worse it is the Era in Pop Culture that has forever changed How we View,See&Hear things.interesting Book.	2002-03-27
Good Overview	I think that Scott Freeman did a Good Solid Job here with this Book.it captures many elements of Ottis Redding.it's a shame that a Major Film&Other things haven't been brought out to capture the Man fully.He did alot in His Short time on Earth.this Book Brings alot to life.The Man as a Artist was One of The Baddest Ever I have Heard.	2002-03-16
Slightly better than Average	this Book is alright for a starter type of book but it doesn't fully grasp all the information one would want in such a Important Heading.when you see a Book that says the History of Rock&Roll you are expecting a Full overview&Insights left&right&this Book doesn't do that.but it's still a Interesting read nevertheless.	2002-03-16
very cliched but things work	having listened to Led Zeppelin's music for years now I always wondered why a Group that had as strong a following as them&were a Huge Act kinda just fell off?this Book answers alot of that.while the Music would have been much more interesting fully brought out more this Book explores the Personalitys of the Band Members.it's Cliche ShowBiz Life,Sex,Drugs,&Rock&Roll&Ego tripping.this is the kind of Book that if you have a One-Sided View of a Act just based on there Talent you may or may not look at them the same.But aside from some Issues within themselves,they were still a Happening Band&that Made there Mark.	2002-03-16
Cool Book	I find this Book to Be very upfront&direct on His Life.I think Barry Manilow is a Very Underrated Artist.here He reflects on different things in his Life&whatnot.I found this Book to Be a Reallt Cool Read.	2002-03-16
Good not Great but very Entertaining	i recently read this Book on Elton John whose 70's work I really still dig more than any other Era of His Stuff.His Music when done with feeling is really on Point.this Book also Explores His Trip Out Sense of Humor&how other Artists are in Contact with Him.Elizabeth Rosenthal does a Good Job at Balance His Carrer&Him as a Person really well.I Would Have Dug More of His Takes on How He hears Other Artists&things.there were a Few Cool Ones with him&Steive Wonder.a good book though.	2002-03-16
I enjoyed this Book	I have liked Joni Mitchell for quite a number of years.Her \\"Blue\\" Album really moves me still to this day.this book works for me because I don't have all Her Albums nor all the lyrics so this is a cool book.I hope that a full overview of Her Career&things will be included in the future in a expanded edition of this book but for now this is really cool.	2002-03-16

Very Average	I Respect Nelson George from way back when, but this Book doesn't really do much for Me one way or the other.as for Russell Simmons I respect the fact He made His Way but overall I don't find Him that Challenging&amp;I can't Respect How He let His Artists kinda just slip without taking care of them Better.Public Enemy,LL COOL J to name a few didn't get the best shake from Him.He gets into His Lifestyle&amp;that's basically it.nothing more nothing less.Very Ordinary read.	2001-11-11

Benza is like a Fast Food Place that says 98.9 percent fat free&amp;Grease.but you still have that 1.1 Percent Grease&amp;Chunk in there well that is Benza.He offers nothing new but a Generic Substitute to what He already is Offering.His E Reporting&amp;Side Gig is far better than a Book on Him.He is a trip but nothing more.	2001-09-15

Hit&amp;Miss	J.Randy Taraborrelli is a trip.His Books on Diana Ross&amp;Michael Jackson were each a Trip.He wrote a few Weak Books as well.this Book falls into in Between.Interesting tidbits but overall unlike the Diana Ross Book witch was a Trip&amp;The Michael Jackson Book that was a Great Read this one just goes into different spots.Madonna is of course one of the most Interesting Subjects In Pop Culture over the past 30 Years but this Book is Hit&amp;Miss&amp; falls just short of being a must to me.	2001-09-09

Two Bigots Together how wonderful?	well first of all Dinesh D'Souza is a straight up Bigot.i bet his next book will be on Gulliani? Ronald Reagan was a Joke as President.Jessie Ventura is Governer maybe he will be President as well? there was nothing  great about Reagan.his civil rights record took everybody back 50 years.he  was Overrated.Tip O'neil called him the Dumbest President ever.Right On!

Brillant as the Man	while i await the Autobiography this book has solid moments.enough to me is never said about the Brillant mind of Quincy Jones.this is a Man without Limits and a Music Pioneer who has done it all and is still doing it.	2000-02-26
Brillant MIND&amp;BOOK	MR.RAndall Robinson is a Man that i have seen countless times on tv with the REv.Jessie Jackson.he is a very bright mind.who brings to the table this book that is long overdue.i can't stand to hear folks say that Slavery  was over 200 years ago.cuz the affects aren't over.being African-American  in America can cause Mental break downs.Repairations are giving to everyone  else but African-Americans.for the folks who ask why still remember? well  two weeks ago CBS ran the Thomas Jefferson movie.it's funny how  African-AMerican Fathers are Labled as deadbeats and whatnot.but the  President of the United States Fathered up to 6 Children with this WOman  and how much ALimony did he pay? sadly she was his Properity? that mind  state hasn't died.folks want to be treated fairly but it's not gonna happen  sadly.yhis book doesn't say Hate anyone it says it's time to wake up and  smell Reality!as the Rapper ICE CUbE once so well put it Their More  Brothers in State PEn than in PENN STATE.that's the Repairation Money.to  hide the ugly past.and slowly ignore the HUMAN PROBLEM THAT HAUNTS AMERICA.	2000-02-26
A Must Read	this was Michael Jackson before Michael Jackson.A Man who could do it all.had his own style,grace&amp;way of doing things.it's a shame he never got the Love he deserved.he was a Pioneer.he could reach so many different  styles of music and wrap them all into one.this book also shows how he got  caught up in excess Sex,Drugs&amp;Rock-N-Roll.but also the Racist Music  Business.I'm a Big Michael Jackson Fan but I know where he got his  foundation.not only from James Brown but also Jackie Wilson.Doug Carter  does a Grand job here.in a fair world Jackie would have held a title.he was  a one of a kind Artist.	2000-02-26
Great book	this is a good book on one of musics most important Artists ever.everybody knows that LITTLE RICHARD Is THE KING OF ROCK-N-ROLL!but that Elvis was a important Musical figure.this book does a solid job of tracing his  upbringing and his rise into the spotlight.	2000-02-26

A great Book	this is a must have book.while it would have been nice to have more info on his wife&amp;BOBBY WOmack this book does a great job of reflecting his musical impact and the Rich Legacy that he left behind.it's a Shame about  his Murder.but once again Black Life in AMerica doesn't have the same  meaning no matter how influential or important you are.ANd Sam Cooke was  all of that.he has inspired countless others.his Business sense was ahead  of the curve as well.to hear him sing A Change Is Coming is still one of  the most Haunting things to me ever.Spike Lee used the song Brilliantly in  Malcolm X right before MaLcolm was Killed.you won't want to put this book  done.his voice&amp;music are as fresh then as it is now.he is a Father of  Music.	2000-02-26
A Must See	folks lie alot.but the music isn't the only thing that is important to them.an Album cover can be a seller as well.you really appreciate that if you grew up on Vinyl.Album covers in some cases reflect what an Artist is  going thru in there current state of mind.it also is a Springboard for the  Vanity Factor of an Artist.this book covers so much&amp;more.very well  Concieved.all forms &amp;Styles get full Treatment here.	2000-02-26

very Powerful	Arthur Ashe was a class act period.the same can be said of his wife as  well.the Brother was very Intelligent and well-spoken and a great tennis  player by the way.the thing that really stood out in this book to me was  the fact when he said that he could deal with AIDS better than Racism.after  reading that part in the book you have to wonder has this country come far  at all? MR.Ashe was a well off Man and he was still dealing with Racists  views and what not.this is a Man of Strength&amp;Courage.he stood for  something.he always gave a 100% in everything he did.this book is very  uplifting.	2000-02-06
a great book	this book is a must have for all to read&amp;see.despite some progress in  Society we still have a long ways to go as far as Equality is  concerned.Money is the Law of the Land.you will never have Justice in a  Land when people have been used and treated as Slaves.one dominate group of  people Govern the rules&amp;regulations on another.everything that was done  to one group is now general Law.Andrew Hacker does a Brillant job of  pointing out things.people are accountable for what they do but by the same  Token your skin is still your calling card out here.	2000-02-06

very compelling	this book has stood the test of time for a reason.it was focused on it's subject.Richard Wright showcases his genius thru out this book.it is a real eye-opener.	2000-01-29
a great book	it's sad to think of this genius untimely death.this book is really focused and gives solid inside details.Tony Brown does a wonderful job.looking at what has happened in music since his death you have to  wonder what other directions he would have gone in.many questions we will  never know but we still have his genius work and that is timeless.	2000-01-23
a good book	i respect LL Cool J alot.i like his older music better than his newer stuff but i always keep an ear on this rap pioneer.so when i found out about this book i was excited and it was real good.the rise of his  career&amp;the inside of the business especially chapter 9.this is the  first book that i've ever read that had a sticker on it.that alone peaked  my interest.he has done alot with his career from rapping,to actor on  tv&amp;film.a good solid read.	2000-01-23
very deep	this book was a solid read about a boy and his family dealing with AIDS and the ignorance surrounding them.it was touching that people such as Elton John,Michael Jackson,REV.Jessie Jackson and others came to the  support of Ryan White&amp;his mother.he was a warrior in a zone of hate.a  very deep book and sad as well.	2000-01-23
a great book	Mr.Powell is a true warrior.overcoming many obstacles and achieving many great things in his life.this book shows so much of the man.not only is he a great leader but also a strong minded man.very loyal and very human.this  is a must read about a true American Hero.	2000-01-22
very interesting book	this book tells many different sides of the panthers good&amp;bad.but even though the way it is written may sway you one way or the other the panthers were very important to the world at large.i do feel that Huey Newton could  have been a real bigger force if headed that way.the minds of the  Men&amp;women in the Panther party are incredible.many of them have gone on  to contribute alot to this country.but if done right they would have been a  political party unto themselves.with all the party's getting  in to  politics this would have been a true challenge.i see the bigger picture of  what might have been.this book leaves room for many different thoughts.	2000-01-15
so/so	i agree with the reviewer that said she slept her way to the top.though she was a part of the group she comes across more like madonna than Angela Davis.talking about all of the celebs that gave up the money for the  party.it doesn't break any ground at all.	2000-01-15
very good book	patti labelle has always been bad.one of the greatest voices ever but to me very underrated she is a true superstar.this book covers her career&amp;personel life.the book has alot of highs&amp;lows.but the Lady  has overcome alot of Drama and continues to shine.she is in a class all by  herself.a very good book.	2000-01-15
a powerful book	Ms.Davis has overcome so much and has led a charge.she takes on human concearns.she is a very bright Lady with alot of class.in a fair world she would have been President or at least Vice -President.cuz she has vision.a  powerful book.	2000-01-15
very insightful	this book takes you on the field.it deals with race,sex,drugs,politics&amp;money.time green does a great job of pointing out the different things that go on off&amp;on the field.i dug the dion  sanders chapter.Dion is so underrated he can play two sports real well and  offense&amp;defense.michael jordan wished he was as talented as Dion.but  that's another debate and topic.this book points out the separation of  races and the lack of hiring Black coaches.the drugs to enhance play.like  Al Davis says just win baby just win.the money cap and how free agency has  changed the game.this book makes sense after this weird and clone style  season.very insightful.	2000-01-13
thought provoking	the book is far more detailed than the movie.in fact it makes the movie look dull in some spots.this book touches on my different topics and very well written.Alice Walker is a genius.she has a touch about her.this book  hits you with so many kinds of emotions all at once.very thought provoking  and a must have.	2000-01-13
a true poet	words don't even begin to describe her genius with words and thoughts.the bottom line is you either have it or you don't and she has that it.her words are timeless and have an impact on everyday life and events.this book  reflects moods× but speak volumes of the world around.for anyone wondering  who is a great poet this is a great start.	2000-01-13
a great book	i saw the movie every summer so it seemed in the early 80's and enjoyed it alot.my father gave me the book and i read it all during the summer of 81.the packard a green convertible the symbol for four dudes going to  Harvard.it was something cool to read.i still have my book.	2000-01-13
very interesting	the title says it all.four deacdes of commentary.how many artists of today will get 4 years let alone 40? there was only one miles davis.who used his music wisely and took risks.now this book has commentary  favorable&amp;negative about his vast body of work.very interesting  feelings from both perspectives.i believe all artists deserve this kind of  feedback if they earn it.and believe me very few will ever get to miles  davis's level.must have book.	2000-01-12
great book very important	Mr.hutchinson asks some powerful questions in this book.it is great to see something that attacks what the media likes to try to prove as fact all the time.he handles each subject matter really well and is very direct.a must  have.	2000-01-12
typical bigot	he has a phd in what hard-core racist ways? his book offers no solutions except roll over and say yes masa.he is a big time sell-out.no class no substance&amp;blind to the fact of life. no wonder why he wrote a book  about that dead beat racist president reagan? this man mr.D'souza offers no  solutions but more problems.	2000-01-12
a powerful read	mrs.Hunter-Gault's book is very powerful.overcoming hostility and race.the fight and determination is a must read for todays youth.i couldn't put this book down.very deep.	2000-01-12
great book	first of all anyone that agrees with d'souza's racist book has got big time hang ups period.this book is well written.the folks hating on this book probably can't understand what he is saying.so they are trying to  discredit his knowledge.but when it comes to race in america most folks are  brain dead.great book to understand society at large.	2000-01-10
a really interesting book	i found this book to be really interesting.mike tyson love or loath him you can't ignore him.and this book puts alot of things into perspective about the man and the myth.all his ups&amp;downs are on display in this book and much much more.the people around him have there own interest at  heart.after cus d'amato things got really wild&amp;crazy.after all these  years mike tyson is still one of the most compelling figures in sports  history ever.	2000-01-10
fantastic book	first of all david ritz is a great writer period.now on to the book i've dug marvin gaye since i came into the world.his music is a reflection of society at large.race,sex,class,economics,&amp;faith.this book points those  things out and so much more.the highs&amp;lows.this man is one of the most  influential artists ever.you take the good with the bad.all books that have  motown related artists seem to be very good reads that says alot about not  only the aritst but also the company.i also love to hear what one artist  thinks and feels about another artists work.a must read for not only folks  that dig marvin or motown but also music in general.	2000-01-09
a great book very eye opening	this book is very eye opening.cuz it asks now what? how about respect? educated and doing well don't have to take nothing from nobody don't have to harm anybody.don't fit in the burbs don't fit in the ghetto where are  you suppose to be? ellis cose answers the questions the best that he  can.it's a very important book for all to study and ponder.you do the right  thing and still aren't accepted? this book is a great discussion.	2000-01-08
a great book	not only is he a great musician but also a very honest man about life.the ups&amp;downs of life and the music business.he comes correct and doesn't sugar coat nothing.very few artists are real and give any details.Mr. white  has overcome alot and still continues to thrive.a must read book.	2000-01-08
the truth about  the current nba	race,sex,drugs,class very much of todays sports in general and life for that matter.while the images of the nba are glossy and everybody says the right thing dennis rodman tells it like it is in this book.he breaks down the current nba and the choices people make.the other parts of this book  reflect his life.and much of it has highs&amp;lows.but as for the nba it  hits home.talks about how certain players are treated differently than  others and who has heart and who doesn't.dennis can play the game if he  wants to.i wish more people in sports and entertainment would speak the  truth as opposed to sounding like programmed robots.	2000-01-08
a great book	teddy pendergrass's book is very well written.i feel it's one of the best bio's that i have ever read.it explains alot of things regarding his music&amp;life.hearing how he started as a drummer before taking over the  mic and his years with harold melvoin&amp;the blue notes.a great book.	2000-01-08
great book	i couldn't put this book down.never mind hollywood's gangster take this book is the real deal.little man is very detailing.it's a must have for folks that love to read about folks connected to the mob.you won't wanna  put this book down.	2000-01-08
powerful!	i bought this book after hearing about it for years.i was interested.well upon reading it i was in a trance.i felt it was compelling.it was so real.reading a book like this makes you look at society at  large.then&amp;now.the reason that this book has lasted as long as it has  is that not only is it brillant but also very real.you don't have to go to  school to find this book great.look at the world around you and read it.you  will the power of it and more.	2000-01-08
great book	the aba was ahead of it's time.everything the nba is doing now was taboo back in the 70's.i'm a firm believer that another league can challenge the majors.this league paved the way for others in different sports.if the aba  had the media that the nba has today it might not have been the same.cuz  what you see nightly was done a 100% times better 25 years back.this book  was great.and a book i couldn't put down.	2000-01-07
a true maverick	this book is great.i 've read this book many times over.i like his honesty about the state of music.his influences and his impact on the music world.the things he is looking for in sound and color.his feelings on  race,class,success,ladies,structure&amp;the world.getting his feelings on  duke,dizzy,jimi hendrix,james brown,sly stone,prince,michael  jackson&amp;wynton marsalis,herbie hancock,john coltrane among many.this  book was well presented by quincy troupe.it's one of the greatest subject  matters that i've ever read.that's the vibe of miles davis.the  highs&amp;lows.i also liked the bond of him&amp;richard pryor and sugar ray  robinson.so many great moments within the context on this book.it sheds  light on personnel things in mr davis's life.a true must read on a musical  pioneer genius&amp;legend.	2000-01-07
very powerful	what i have always repected about mrs.morrison is herfrankness.she isn't afraid to tell it like it is.be itrace,sex,class,self-esteem&amp;the world at large.this book deals with subjects head on and isn't afraid to tell this story.it's a real eye opener for folks that don't realize how important it is to tell children that no matter what color or shade&amp;size that they are loved and wanted.very powerful book.	2000-01-06
brillant	i enjoyed the book alot.the man was the first triple threat acting,directing&amp;music.he could do it all.his movies were great.the characters &amp; stories were done really well.the book tells of his  highs&amp;lows.i also enjoyed the film about his life.a must read.a true  pioneer.	2000-01-06
incredible	the man was not only a great ball player but a reminder of the struggle for african-americans.he broke down so many doors.imagine having the fbi escort you to a baseball game? hate mail for breaking babe ruth's record?  jackie robinson&amp;larry doby opened the doors as well as the negro league  but mr. Aaron kicked it thru.he is a class act and a true ambassador.he  stared racisim dead in the eye and achieved.a true hero for all time.this  book states that&amp;more.	2000-01-06
very powerful	what i have always repected about mrs.morrison is her frankness.she isn't afraid to tell it like it is.be it race,sex,class,self-esteem&amp;the world at large.this book deals with subjects head on and isn't afraid to tell  this story.it's a real eye opener for folks that don't realize how  important it is to tell children that no matter what color or  shade&amp;size that they are loved and wanted.very powerful book.	2000-01-06
what happen?	i love aretha franklin she is my all-time favorite female artist&amp;singer but this book has many pot holes.coming from a lady who has most of her life been very honest in her music this is a puzzle.i  expected her to unload and really break down the music biz but that's not  happening here.if i want mysteries i'll read stephen king.i still dig my  box set of aretha's and the other music i have of hers but as for books  forget about it.the queen took a stumble here.	2000-01-06
great book	i love her honesty. she talks about race,sex,class,self-esteem and her personnel life really well.she is a true soul singer who doesn't always get the love she deserves.i've always respected her and this book took it to  another level.the music business and it's politics.very upfront.she reminds  me of my aunt so down to earth and like family.buy the book and her pips  work.especially claudine the soundtrack with the late great curtis mayfield  from 76.	2000-01-06
great book	i thought the book was great.it didn't discredit her to me.cuz if you liked&amp;respected her work then you wouldn't trip on the book.she has given the world some of the most important music ever and has been very  influential.but also she wasn't always fair to the other members of the  surpremes and fellow motown artists.everybody has two sides to the coin and  it's important for balance.she is a true diva.that word is used loosely  today.	2000-01-06
a great book	i enjoyed this book.it details so much.this man is the true king of rock-n-roll.and he has always been upfront about different subjects.he has had an enormous impact on the music world.this book tells of racisim and  the constant battle for respect and truth.this man is a true original.	2000-01-05
a must read	very powerful&amp;uplifting.it touches on many different subjects.racisim,poverty etc..who hasn't this man not influenced? to see a human being overcome so many hardships&amp;provide a innovative  sound&amp;style is incredible.but Mr.brown is a man with few peers on his  level.this book explores the legend&amp;genius of james brown.	2000-01-05
i enjoyed this book	the media found michael jackson guilty and still carries that over his head.i'm glad mrs.campbell comes out and gives a fair side of the story.journalism has gone down the toilet for me.they will write and say  anything to sell a paper.michael maintained his innocence and should be  allowed to continue with his life.i hope she writes another book on mj.the  next one back on music.	2000-01-02
a great book about the greatest	from the first time i got the book and read it i was so happy.this man was a genius in the ring and a human force outside of it.this book showcases all the many sides of the greatest.very compelling and full of insight.it  showcases the myths&amp;mystic of the man.one of the greatest bios that  i've ever read.	2000-01-02
very important book	this book is a must for all.never mind that folks try to say that tv or entertainment doesn't matter.that's b s. cuz the images of african-americans from the film world,sports world&amp;music world have  left a lasting impact.and lets be honest what other race of people have  been emulated,influential&amp;scorned all at once from a visual image? this  book speaks volumes of african-american history from the silent film era to  now.and though there has been progress we still have a long ways to go.cuz  the title of the book is still very much alive in  hollywood&amp;america.preception that is hasn't gone away.it is still  reflected in some folks mind of rap music.the use of put down terms among  rappers&amp;folk out on the streets is reflected heavily in this book.which  is a sad commentary.but this book is survial and the costs that were made  to pave the way for future generations.	2000-01-02
very thought provoking	this man is a genius.whenever he speaks or debates someone i'm all ears and eyes.i've enjoyed all of his books.he has a of wording ideas and thoughts and tieing everything as one.he could connect dr.king,michael  jackson,malcolm x&amp;stevie wonder into one with the plight&amp;struggle.i  once saw him on sinbad's vibe show with the brillant nikki giovanni and he  was talking and resighting the brillant lyrics of rakim.my mouth hit the  floor.i wish he had a show alongside of tony brown&amp;rev jessie  jackson.this man speaks volumes in this book and is highly intelligent.a  must read.	2000-01-02
a book on the greatest	i enjoyed this book so much.especially about unreleased material.michael jackson is the greatest artist ever.he has done it all and still he gets no love.it will take another 50-100 years for folks to know how great this  artist is&amp;was.i bought both books by the author and was impressed with  her knowledge and detail of the subject.i hope she writes a third.	2000-01-02
another powerful book	i could read his work all the time period.he has a way of just being to the point.he brings to light so much of what i think about and feel as a african-american man.and he has put marvin gaye titles to supreme good  solid usage's.there are many unanswered questions,fears&amp;unknowns as we  are in a new century.but a book like this answers much of what i already  see&amp;feel.	2000-01-02
very honest	this man is a legend.he is bigger than comedy.he is everyday life.this book reflects the flaws&amp;the genius of this man.i used to wait until my folks were asleep and sneak his tapes on.they were extremly funny but also  thought provoking.it dealt with issues that he was facing.race being the  number one factor.and he was very open and straight to the point about  it.sex  he didn't hold back his thoughts.same with drugs.his work is still  imitated&amp;sampled.the man has left a lasting impact on my life and  countless others.this is one of the greatest biographys that i've ever  read.captivating and honest just like the man.must read.he is the king of  comedy for me.	2000-01-02
great book	this book has so many topics and is alot of fun.the best mc's,best rivials on wax,free-style.songs that mention po-po problems,cars,sex,girls,drugs,clothes,hoods,and dreams etc.. very well  written.it gives another insight to the rap world that most folks don't  hear about.the rappers that have worked with michael jackson and lauyrn  hill's all-time favorite artists.2pac segement that will have you thinking?  puffy gets dissed so much on record it ain't even funny.it's as important  as anything that rolling stone has put out period in there history.must  have book.fun,insightful,and a piece of history.	1999-12-23
a real eye opener	this book captures so much.prince is one of my all-time favorite artists ever.but i prefer his work more in the first decade than now.which is what the author presents.finally a book that talks about his music.separating  the fact from fiction.the importance of wendy&amp;lisa and his personnel  thing.somehow the book evens things out with what he has become and  said.true he had battles with warner brothers but he was in turn taking  ideas from others and not crediting them.on stage and what have you he  seemed cool and confident but he was very insecure off.which has come up in  this decade.with alot of his musical choices.the black album chapter which  the last reviewer hit perfectly on the head was a real eye opener.my mouth  dropped to the floor in surprise. call it ironic or not prince brought back  the linn drum machine for the rave album? the linn gets alot of mentions  and props in the book.this book shows him following the james brown path of  being the hardest working man in show business.making up to 3 albums in a  six month time period never mind side songs.it's the best and most complete  reading on prince.prince a pop life by dave hill was a good b+ book but  this is a A.it talks about uptown in full detail.this book sheds light on  the good,bad&amp;scary in the life of prince rogers nelson.a must have.cuz  whether you love him or you hate him you have to respect his impact on  music and any music fan should have this book.	1999-12-18
