Overly too long	This book has too many pages that doesn't say anything at all. Each chapter has an introduction of how is the weather that is just boring. And at the end why the bad guys just confessed their felonies?<br /><br />When you know who was the bad guy and why you'll drop the book of this nonsense story. Definitely are much better books than this one because this one is not even a thriller, is a waste of time.	2005-10-13
Just and only six stars	When you start a book and as you're reading the book gets better and better. You don't have an inkling of who's the father. Who's the bad guy. What's the worst family secret. Simply you can't leave the book close for more than a few minutes.<br />After ending the book you'll ask yourself if you really have family problems.<br /><br />Excellent book.	2005-10-10
Just skip the epilogue	The book's story is fair enough. Part of the story could be real, but not even a quarter of the book.  The book will keep you in the story and in the time of the book. Nevertheless the real thrilling part begins after you already read three quarters of the story. Then you wouldn't be able to put the book down.<br /><br />The epilogue is worthless even if it explains what happened to John Dillinger. You can skip it and lose nothing.	2005-10-01
What an end!	The paranormal story in this book will keep you reading and thrilling you. At some parts of the book KH will try to do something that couldn't be possible, but she never did. So at least everything in this book could be \\"real\\". I won't tell you what is because I will tell you the spooky story. The problem with this book is the end of it. I think that KH didn't know how to end it and she asked one of her offspring to do it. This end is among the poorest ends I've ever read.	2005-09-26
Like an eagle	This book or maybe this writer swoops like an eagle. JP wanted to do an excellent thriller mingling his two archenemies in one book. All he did was a waste of time, paper, ink and anything else you'd like. The story goes out of the main plot so many times, or rather I say it goes in the plot so little that you forget what are you reading.<br /><br />The Weasel:<br /><br /> If you already read 'Pop Goes the Weasel' you'll know that the way Dr. Cross killed the Weasel is pathetic. Why? Because the Weasel is suppose to be ruthless and relentless and independent and very cunning. Everything that happens to him in this book made him conceit and reckless and meek and tame.<br /><br />The Wolf<br /><br />I don't know why JP wrote so many pages with this character, at the end of the book, the way the FBI's director knew who he was was dimwit. He could do that kind of investigation in the first pages of the book and we could save some paper and time with that. The way Dr. Cross get him was hilarious.	2005-09-20
The perfect six stars writer	Since the first page till the epilogue you wouldn't be able to put the book down or even think in anything else. The plot is perfectly well written and J.T. Dilon's background will keep you awake at night trying to figure out what happened in his childhood. In the other hand, Tess's story will make you cry, hate and read faster than you think.<br /><br />SIX stars for this writer.	2005-09-17
Where's the plot?	Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less.	2005-09-13
A six stars ending	Since the beginning of the book you'll know that Dr. Mallory has a big bombshell secret. The problem is that you won't have any inkling of what it is until the last chapter, and that end will flabbergast you. Well, I agreed that you'll have some inkling of the end, but that'll be almost at the end.<br />Definitely SIX stars for SB.	2005-09-09
Really boring	I don't know if I just didn't like the way JG writes or this story is farfetched. The book has several stories and all of them are boring. The killer who wants to kill Regan but before he tries to slaughter all the persons she hated just to please her is pathetic. The way Dr. Shields draw a new life to his \\"students\\" is  more than trite. In addition her book goes out of those stories so many times that is really boring.<br /><br />Query:<br /><br />How can any employee make whatever he wants to his/her boss and nobody does anything?	2005-09-03
A six stars thriller	When you read a book and you just can't put it down. When everything you  read could be real, that's an excellent thriller.<br /><br />The way FF describe what is doing the killer and how is using and killing people in his path is unique. The plot to kill DeGaulle and its timing will thrill you all the way till the end of the book. But most important of all is that at the end of it you'll have two questions:<br /><br />1) It was true this conspiracy to kill DeGaulle?<br /><br />2) Who really was the killer?	2005-08-31
By very far not Cresswell's best	If you compare this book with another one written by JC like: \\"Dead Ringer\\", \\"The Third Wife\\", \\"Conspiracy\\" and  obviously its prequels. You'll think that she wrote this book just to finish the series. Albeit is a thriller in more than half book it has its very boring parts, for example the Xmas dinner or how Melody or Nick \\"fought\\" with Josh at the gym among others. I agree that this book is more a personal biography of Melody and Nick and has almost nothing to do with Unit One. So I think that JC could had finish this series with another idea. This doesn't mean that this book is a waster but definitively not the best of the writer.	2005-08-29
Very good beginning...	The book will keep you reading and thrilling you little more than half of it. When they found what happened to Sally's father it swoops down faster that an eagle and that make the book boring. After that, you'll not know if you want to finish the book or do something else. The end is like a fairy tale when God says: \\"Everything will be fine.\\" And they lived happily ever after.	2005-08-27
If you compare it with its prequels...	The main story of the book is excellent. The problem is if you can find it before getting bored and fling the book away. If you compare this book with its prequels 'The Third Victim' and 'The Next Accident' you won't read even half book. Now, you have to have in mind that you don't need to read the prequels to understand this book. But you have to do it to understand why I only gave two stars to this story. As every human being, the writers have ups and downs and I think here LG was very down.<br /><br />Query:<br /><br />How is possible that a person drinks super-contaminated water and survive?	2005-08-19
SIX para...stars	It doesn't matter if you believe or not in paranormal things. It doesn't matter if you don't read paranormal books because they're spooky. Albeit this book has all of that and yes, you'll be spooked two or three times, it's worth to read the book because the plot won't let you put it down. The spooky part is almost nothing and you can enjoy an excellent reading even if you don't like that. And I have to tell you that the end of the book is really creepy but not spooky.	2005-08-12
Very good after the firsts pages	At first when the computer said who are the killers of the firsts cases you'll be bored and thinking that this book won't be a thriller at all if someone just click the mouse and the bad guys go out of the closet. After that, when the computer began to blunder and no one know what to do, that's when the book starts. So don't be disappointed with the firsts pages of the book. After you go through them you won't be able to put the book down. So I really can give this book SIX stars.	2005-08-06
Almost but not quite good	This book has exactly four stories that supposedly merge at the end, but:<br /><br />1) The main story, the terrorists' one is a real thriller and will keep you reading all the time (when you can find this story among the pages of the book.)<br /><br />2) The story of the journalist is overly long and after reading too many pages that says nothing at all you'll find exactly two paragraphs that are very important to the main story. This means that this story could be written with many less trees.<br /><br />3) The president's story is good enough but the first two assignments he has to do are worthless and a waste of time. Those you definitely can skip them.<br /><br />4) The story of the 17 years old drunk kid definitely doesn't have anything to do in this book.	2005-08-05
Farfetched	The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched. Everything they do to trap the killer is pathetic. The trip to Italy and changing the newspapers in the web is hilarious. The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way.	2005-07-30
It'll keep you reading	The story of the book is great because albeit Quincy is a renown shrink he didn't resolve the case just because he knew how thugs think, you'll understand each step on the book. The problem is that it has some boring parts and some parts that you wouldn't understand if you didn't read first \\"The Third Victim\\". The best thing about writing continuous books is that you can read any one of the series without reading the first ones and understand it.<br />Maybe what I've should done was make one book of these two and make one big story, but I've to accept that the first book was pretty better than this one.	2005-07-28
To have a good time	Albeit this book is not a thriller, nor a love story, nor a medical story it'll hook you to read it fast. Sometimes you'll guess what will happen next but you won't be able to put it down. The way the laboratory manages the virus and its personnel lacks in security all the time but that doesn't mean that is out of reality or it can't happen in many laboratories. So don't read this book thinking that is a Robin Cook or Michel Palmer's medical thriller and you'll like it.	2005-07-24
Overly boring	First the book'll hook you up thinking that you'll read about some ruins in Yucatan. Then the main story changes to show us that the best US's spy just made mistake by mistake and they let him being a spy even if everybody knows all of his names. The book is too repetitive about how Buchanan changes his name and someone finds out his new name, made one mistake and one error until he blundered almost everything, but he is the only one to save his own situation. Meanwhile the book leaves you to nothing really interesting. Sincerely is a waste of time and trees.	2005-07-21
Let's compare two books	First of all Sam's Letters aren't the main story of the book. The main story is Jeniffer's love story and the letters has nothing to do with this book. If you compare \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\" with this book lets see what'll happen:<br /><br />1= Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas<br /><br />2= Sam's Letters to Jennifer<br /><br />Love story 1 Excellent  2 Good<br /><br />Reading the diary/letters 1 Excellent 2 Waste of time<br /><br />The story outside diary/letters 1 Excellent. 2 Excellent<br /><br />Emotions (cry, laugh, hate, etc.) 1 Excellent 2 Poor<br /><br />Book's end 1 Excellent 2 Poor	2005-07-15
Why six stars?	The least of the times you take a book is to learn something really important. You read a book to have a good time, because someone gave it to you or any other reason you like. But when you read a book and you understand why are the killings at schools. What are the kids' main problems. That the deans has their own life and own problems and those problems implicate the students, maybe before you send your kid into a new school you'll want to know the background of the teachers and deans.<br /><br />At the end you'll think about the life of the police, their problems and how they solve them, the end of the book is not a happy ending, but it deserves SIX stars.	2005-07-14
Good imagination, bad omen.	Reading this story after 9/11 makes you believe that this kind of standoff could happen. But also make you thing how short  the imagination of a person could be compared with reality. In the other hand as you can see in the reviews before 9/11/2001 people didn't believe this story as real.<br /><br />The book is a little heavy in some parts but you won't be able to put it down till you finish it. In the book we can see JC's good imagination but very bad omen.	2005-07-12
Fast reading	As many SS's books this one is very fast & easy to read and the inside plot is good enough to keep you reading. One thing that I like of some writers is that they put women at the same par as men. Although is a good thriller you can take this book on your vacations and read it here and there and stop it when you have something else to do or maybe you'll end it in a long flight. It has many points out of reality like from where Diane and  Kelly have money to do everything they did, but that doesn't take down any star.	2005-07-04
By far not Baldacci's best	Albeit you can have a good time reading this book definitely is not a thriller. Some times you won't know what to do, watch TV or read the book. The beginning of the book is very good, but as you read is getting worse and worse but the end is the worse of all. With a quick sleight of hand Sean knew who were both killers and why, I read that part of the book three times and I still don't know how he knew all those things. Sincerely are much better books than this one.	2005-07-01
Why?	Why an excellent writer as JP needs somebody else's help? You can compare this book with '1st to Die', that is a book! Not this one. Maybe when he'll write 'The Fifth Amendment' (I think that'll be his next book, but that doesn't mean I'll buy it,  the only way I'll read it is if someone lend it to me.) He will write it alone again.<br /><br />In this book Lindsay's team and nothing is the same, the only thing they did was to ooze margaritas, and her boyfriend just appearing and disappearing is just pathetic. I still think that Lindsay's first boyfriend in '1st to Die' had had to be alive and help her in all her cases confiding him all her dreads.<br /><br />When you read a trial and you know that the defendant is saying the truth. The plaintiff is taking the 5th Amendment to not commit perjury and the lawyer is fibbing with the facts is just pathetic. And the fact that you know who will win the trail it just make boring reading it.<br /><br />When the trial ends the book gets a real thriller, but that's only the last 100 pages or so, so you can skip this book or wait till someone gives it in your birthday.	2005-06-21
A great book	I think this is not the plots LH wont to write or maybe this is the first of its kind that I read. I have to say that this book is explicit in every point. It shows the ruthless methods of the CIA to accomplish their goals. The methods that uses the mob knowing that the CIA knows and they have their permission granted. The way many people take things as they like and nobody does anything.<br />In fewer words I recommend this thriller to everyone who loves CIA and FBI thrillers.	2005-06-19
How many stars?	1  Since you open this book you will be in the plot not knowing whom to believe, Anna or Joe.<br /><br />2  You'll ask yourself about polygamy, pros and cons (pros if you're a man, cons if you're a woman).<br /><br />3  You'll think twice before confide your secrets to your very best friend.<br /><br />4  You'll be torn between ending the book or savoring a little bit more not wanting to end it.<br /><br />5  You'll have no clue, not even an inkling of who are the bad guys until the last page.<br /><br />6  You'll have a great time reading this excellent book.	2005-06-15
A good writer	IJ knows how to get you inside her books. As I wrote in other review, she doesn't pierce enough in her investigations while writing a book. But definitely she knows how to write and how to keep you reading until you finish the book. The epilogue is worthless but five more pages to read it doesn't bother anyone. If you are an avid reader you could finish this book in three days and of course you'll enjoy it.	2005-06-14
Do you want to learn Italian?	If you want to learn Italian or you want a guided tour of northern Italy read this book. Otherwise skip it.	2005-06-09
Six stars for Sidney	Since the beginning of the book till the last page you'll be in the book, with the book and over the book. The three personalities of Ashley that started at three different stages of her childhood are perfectly believable. Everything in this book could be true so that means that we have to take extra care with our children everywhere and all the time.<br /><br />The end of the book is amazing and will let you thinking if really exist a person who can tell you how the brain works. I don't think so.	2005-06-03
Just beautiful	You could read this book in a flight from LA to San Diego. You'll hate Matt at the beginning but you have to understand why he did what he did. While reading the diary you'll cry, if you have them you'll have reveries about your children's first days. You'll laugh a lot and you'll cry a little but you'll hate Matt a little bit more, every page you read you'll hate him more and more... till the end that you'll understand why he did what he did and that worth the reading of this book.	2005-06-02
Nothing spectacular	Thrilling:<br /><br />The first ambush of the book'll keep you interested and you'll think that this will be an excellent book.<br /><br />The way Aaron made all his plans to avenge his father.<br /><br />The way the army try to find him and the way he kills his enemies (Nathan).<br /><br />Repeating:<br /><br />In the book are five killings and one reverie of a killing so is written in the book six times how the slug tore the chest of the victim and how destroy everything inside the chest. It also repeat the same with the slug that enters in the skull of the same victim.<br /><br />How he is waiting for the victims to show up so he can kill them.<br /><br />How he takes care of the distance with his rifle and measures the wind and movement of the victim twice (the chest and the skull).<br /><br />Boring:<br /><br />If you know how to use sharpshooter's weapon maybe you will understand that part of the book, but if you don't you'll bore reading those parts (by the way, is written in the book at least four times).<br /><br />The love story as it was written is just pathetic.<br /><br />And I'd never forget the fairy tale end. How is possible that a man killed six persons and they just leave him free just because?	2005-05-31
How many stars?	When you read a book and you can't keep it down.<br /><br />When the book is easy and fast to read.<br /><br />When you get involved  in the story.<br /><br />When you don't know whom to believe.<br /><br />When you don't know how the book'll end till you read the last word of it.<br /><br />And the most important. When you have a great time while reading it.<br /><br />The book deserves just and only six stars.	2005-05-27
The plot is good... the sequel is bad	The stories of pedophiles and child molesters are ugly and very difficult to write and keep the reader interested in the story and not only thinking dire things about the abductors. That part of the book is very good as KS explains all that happened to the kids. But the first third of the book is boring because it explains lamely what happened in the first book \\"Blindsighted\\". Nevertheless you must read the first book to understand this one, and the gist of writing sequel books is that you must understand the second or third book without reading the first one. To do that you must write in the sequel just enough information of the previous books. This book has many things about the first one but it never explains anything, so if you already read \\"Blindsighted\\" you will bore reading the first pages of the book, but if you didn't read it you won't understand anything.<br /><br />If you want to read more of this kind of plot read \\"Out of Reach\\" by Patricia Lewin.	2005-05-21
Five is not enough	Who are the good guys? Why? Who are the bad guys? Why?<br /><br />When you read this book you'll understand and you'll try to answer these questions. That doesn't mean that your answer will be the same as mine or the same as other person who read this book. I like these kind of books because they let you thinking what is good and what is wrong. The answer is not in the book, is in your mind.<br /><br />The  story never goes out of the plot so you'll read this book in almost no time because you wouldn't be able to put it down.<br /><br />Definitely SIX stars for this one.	2005-05-18
swoop	As many other reviewers said this plot could be much better exploited. The haunted part of the book is so pathetic that you can skip it just when you start reading it. It doesn't have any sense and it was written just to fill more pages in the book.<br />When you read a spies' book and the FBI doesn't had any lead to the killer and the killer just give up because he thinks that he doesn't have to live anymore is pathetic, and more if this killer is an expert sniper and turned down the FBI twice before.<br />The plot is interesting and will keep you reading until the end, but at the end you'll be so disappointed that you'd have thought that you'd  never have read this book. I think you can skip this one and look for other FBI or spies' books from other writers for example:<br /><br />  'Dead Ringer' by JASMINE CRERSSWELL<br /><br />or  'Blind Run' by PATRICIA LEWIN<br /><br />among others.	2005-05-15
How many stars does deserve this book?	1)  It's a sheer different spies' story written in this book.<br /><br />2)  You won't know what will happen in the next page until JC want you to know.<br /><br />3)  The book never goes out of the main story or have difficult explanations  that nobody understand.<br /><br />4)  You won't be able to put the book down no matter what you have to do instead of reading.<br /><br />5)  It makes you think of what other people think about the US homeland security.<br /><br />6)  It has many turns, but is an easy reading and you won't get lost in the plot.	2005-05-10
Nice & easy	This book is a fast & easy read. You'll get hooked since the prologue to the last chapter, but I think that it would be much better if Lindsay's boyfriend wouldn't die in the first book and he would help the Women's Murder Club. Of course is just what I think. And the way Lindsay found the bad guy is much better and credible than in 3rd Degree. So the ranking of these three books is exactly as they were written:<br /><br />1  1st to Die<br /><br />2  2nd Chance<br /><br />3  3rd Degree<br /><br />4  4th of July (June 21, 2005)	2005-05-08
Boring ending	The story of Milla trying to find her baby is so excellent that you'll never put the book down. The way that Diaz has to solve things will make you flabbergast. The way Milla and Diaz found who were the bad guys will thrill you. The way Milla found that Diaz didn't want her to find her baby will stun you. The way the Finders work will cheer you. The last chapter of the book will make you cry. BUT the last fifty pages before the last chapter when Milla was in her very best distress because she gave her son away, could be written in seven pages at the most. How many times can you read that she woke up, ate breakfast, went to sleep, ate lunch, etc.?	2005-05-03
Just to have fun	Let me tell you that you'll read this book in no-time. But the end of the book is worthless, I think that the last pages RC said to his child to finish the book and he finished at his will. In the book are many loose ends that when you're reading the book seems important, but when you finish the book and you see that those stories never ended you'll be disappointed. I won't give you here these examples just in case you want to read the book. As always with all RC's books you'll think  twice  before going to an hospital.<br />Despite all of the above, you'll have a good time reading this book but don't expect an excellent end. Thinking better, don't expect anything at the book's end (the last two chapters and the epilogue.)	2005-04-25
Super Kid	Is spooky...<br /><br />Is thrilling...<br /><br />Is eerie...<br /><br />No. Is Super Kid.<br /><br />You can read stories that you know aren't true. You can read fantasies. You can read thrilling fairy tales. But when you read a story that is nothing of the above, that could be written in half pages than is written, that has a Super Kid who can do whatever he wants in NY. Know how to go in the maze of an unknown house and can save her mother is just pathetic. This wasn't the first JS's book that I read, but if this were the first one I'd never read another book written by him.<br /><br />If you really like these kind of books where people is always in its youth read<br /><br />Fountain Society  by Wes Craven	2005-04-20
Kind of new type of thriller	The book will keep you reading from the first page till the last one. At the beginning you'll think that this book will be full of gore. I can't tell you that has none of it but the book doesn't get explicit on that scenes although you will understand them perfectly. The story of Sara and Jeff has its wrong things like how she explain to him why she can't have babies and he accept it just because. And who cuts Sybil's navel?<br />The investigation of the rapist is well written and at the book's end you will have a burden off your back. Not by knowing that they will save Lena, that part is obvious, but the way they saved her.	2005-04-15
Not recommendable	The beginning of the book is excellent, but when you keep it reading is getting worse and worse. When you get to the end is just pathetic, why?<br /><br />At first when Alex wants to know who killed her mother and she has all the arguments to do that will keep your reading. Then when her grandma tells her that she was responsible for her mother's dead you'll be hilarious, why? Because when Alex's mother died she has two months, and no one at that age is responsible for nothing. So here you will know that her grandmother was insane.<br /><br />Everybody supposed who killed Alex's mother, but nobody knows exactly and everybody is hiding the facts from whom knows who. That includes a suicide that is more than pathetic.<br /><br />The first time the killer speaks to Alex you will know that is the killer and at that moment you can close the book if you want to, because when the killer tells Alex how the job was done, forgets to tell her how gets the weapon to kill her mother, and that is a very important fact that you'll never know.<br /><br />At the end, the only one who knew who was the killer was Alex. She drops the charges and nobody does nothing about all the lies that everybody were saying to keep secret who the killer was and nobody knew who it was.	2005-04-14
A good writer	Albeit the second book (Full Pursuit) is much better than this one, this book is also an extraordinary writ that won't let you close it till you finish it. This book has everything: mystery, love, science, slaughter and some jokes. Everything'll thrills you till the end.<br />If Unit One really exists or not that's a good question, and if they work as the book says is a better one. Now we have to wait until they release the last one of the sequel (Final Justice) to compare the three books.	2005-04-05
As many books...	As many books of this kind, the writer thinks that because he made something and he has some advantage of what he did, everybody has to do the same to have a better life. I think that only a very few people would change everything they have to find the spiritual peace. Albeit what is written in the book could be written with some wisdom I don't think that anybody will do exactly as the book says.	2005-04-04
Too many lose ends	First of all this book goes out of the main story so many times that could be written with many less trees, for example who cares how Alice and Henry play pool and how exactly they hit the balls? Each new date has an introduction of how is the weather or how is everybody dressed, this is OK if it were only a few dates, but all the book is filled with dates.<br /><br />Contradictory:<br /><br />In the middle of the book Henry said that they'll never have offspring, and they have one child.<br /><br />Why in the very first date (when Henry is 36 and Clare 6) Henry knows exactly what'll happen next and in the first date that Clare meet Henry (Henry 28 Clare 20) Henry doesn't know anything of her although he tells Clare when and where they'll meet. And why he again knows everything when he mets his young self at the museum? Why he also doesn't know anything about the football player who beats Clare?<br />If Henry is dead how he can see her daughter in the future? If he can do that why can't he see Clare in the future? And not only when Clare is 82.<br />How will Henry teach his daughter to steal and mug if he is already dead?<br /><br />I'll not say anything about the pathetic Clare's \\"affair\\"<br /><br />Everything is repeated at least twice, when it happens and when Clare or Henry explains it and I don't like to read the same thing at least twice in the same book.<br /><br />When you read half book and you'll know exactly what the end will be, the book is a waste of time.<br /><br />IF YOU REALLY WANT TO READ AN EXCELLENT TIME TRAVELER'S LOVE STORY, READ \\"UNTIL FOREVER\\" by Johanna Lindsey AND WE GLADLY CAN COMPARE BOTH BOOKS.	2005-03-31
Overly long story	I agree that this is a good medical thriller. But the story  is too long. Too many diseases, too many deaths in the same manner. And at three quarters of it you know where does the diseases came from, so that make the reading a little heavy because you know that whatever they thought about the diseases is wrong. I don't know why, but 90% of RC's books are against Medicare or another Health Organization so I think that maybe RC started writing because he had a problem with one of these Organizations.<br /><br />Taking my jest apart, is a very readable book.	2005-03-29
Good enough	This is an easy book to read. I haven't yet read 2nd Chance but 1st to Die is much better than this one. This doesn't mean that this is not a good book but the way Lindsay knew where the bad guys dwell was just pathetic. That aside the book will keep you reading, smiling and weeping sometimes at least while reading Jill's story and at least Lindsay found the love of her life. In a long flight you will read it at once.	2005-03-17
I really like to read six stars books	How do I know when to put six stars to a book?<br /><br />When the story you are reading could be true.<br /><br />When you read all the time about the main story, that means no landscape explanations or stories that doesn't have to do with the main one.<br /><br />When the book has no sex explicit scenes.<br /><br />When the book doesn't goes with scientific explanations that no one'll understand.<br /><br />When the end of the book is not a fairy tale and it keeps you thinking what you'd do.<br /><br />When you have a great time reading and not wanting to put the book down.<br /><br />The story of this book is different from many spies stories and that'll hook you to read it fast. You'll want to know what will happen in the next page but sometimes you will have some inklings about that, the final raid is almost predictable, but you will never guess the end  of it.	2005-03-15
Always the same	This book will tell you the experiences of a maid and what she does to her patron and what her patron does to her, as all these kind of books, after you read half of it you will know what will happen in the next page, in the middle of the book is a murder that nobody can solve and after that is a robbery that also nobody can solve, so this book is a waste of time, nevertheless let me tell you that what happened with that maid in 1900 is exactly what happen with the maids today.	2005-03-08
Not even closer to A Time to Kill	Although the first part of the book as the third part are really thrilling, you can skip almost all the second part, what happened when Danny was in jail is a waste of time except two or three things that could be written in two pages, the only message of this book is that in Mississippi there were no laws, and the few that existed you could break them if you had enough money to bribe the correct person.	2005-03-08
Excellent writer!	Definitely SB is one of the best writers I ever read, all her books are thrilling since the first page till the last one, of course this book included. You will want to know what will happen in the next page and you won't be able to know who is the killer until the last chapter. Although is a hearth transplant story you won't read anything about E.R. all you will read is a thrilling story about a serial killer and that story will keep you thinking in the book until you finish it. As many books written by her, this one deserves SIX STARS.	2005-03-08
Nice start dire ending	The first half of the book was amazing, the killings and the investigation as well. When Kraag starts to solve the case just because he is a shrink is out of reality but nevertheless the book is still readable. But the last part of the book, when all the uniform personnel of the USA goes to the farm to take Mike is foolish and so it is the whole negotiation with Moray to get Mike.<br />At the end of the book just out of a sleight of hand appear the killer and everything you have read goes to the bin.	2005-03-03
Just skip this one	When you read pages and pages of a book and says nothing.<br /><br />When a book could be written in half pages that it was.<br /><br />When you don't know what to do, if pick the book or watch TV.<br /><br />When you will know the end at the beginning, the book is worthless<br /><br />I had to work hard on this one and if you suffer while reading a book just don't worth it. I gave this book two stars because my book's qualification is from two to six.	2005-02-24
Excellent at every word, definitely a SIX STARS BOOK	When you start reading a book and you can't put it down.<br /><br />When you regret that you are not reading it because you have to do something else.<br /><br />When no-part of the book is boring (here I have to accept that the last six or seven pages of the penultimate chapter (pages 370-376), after the hostage release, are boring, but you must read them to understand the book's finish).<br /><br />When you can't guess what'll happen in the next page.<br /><br />When everything you read could be true.<br /><br />When you think that the book is already finish with a fairy tale end and you have to read 40 more pages to read an excellent end.<br /><br />With all these points, the book deserves SIX stars.<br /><br />And I almost forget that you'll learn very important things about the Deaf people.	2005-02-23
James knows how to write	If you expect in this book a thriller like The Da Vinci Code you will be very disappointed. You have to read this book like a novel, or better like a love story which doesn't have anything to do with reality. I'm pretty sure that JP didn't make any investigation to write this book. He just wrote a novel to entertain his readers and he made it quite good. Don't expect to learn something out of this book, just sit down, read and enjoy the book. It's worth every word in it	2005-02-15
Good horses' book	First of all let me tell you that I don't know anything about horses, at least at the end of this book I learned something. At first the book is an interesting reading and learning about horses, but after some pages of the same you will bore reading it. Nonetheless this is only the first pages of the book, because the rest of it is an excellent thriller and the end of the book is outstanding.	2005-02-10
Good writing but...	The Hoyle's family story will keep you reading, but not thrilling you, the Syare's (with r-e) love story is very predictable since she met Beck Merchant and since they met, you will know how their love story would end.<br />The book repeats itself several times and that makes the reading a little heavy but not enough to leave the book.<br />On the other hand, except for the predictable love story, you will never guess or have any inkling on how the book will end, and just for that its worth to read the book.	2005-02-04
A hillbilly story	At book's beginning you'll expect a warfare-sad novel which will tell you what Wes's problems were and why he was absent almost all the time. When you see this is not the main plot of the novel you might be disappointed, but don't worry because the plot in the book is good enough to keep you in the story. I can't say that it is a thriller, but Storm's story with his new drug and Ally's love story are excellent. You will laugh several times during the diner at Ally's house. As many books, this one has ups and downs but is quite a good read.	2005-01-27
You need a shot?	This is the first RC's book that the MDs aren't guilty of medicine's malpractice , albeit the book has too many coincidences is a great story if you aren't pregnant, if such is your case don't read it until you have your baby.<br />As always with these kind of books you'll be afraid to go to any MD or hospital because you will see the dark side of  medicine's practice, but you will be hooked to the book all the time. I don't know if its possible to poise a vial as is written in the book but that will make you check and recheck the medicine vials always.	2005-01-24
Five stars is not enough	Since the first word of the book till the last one you will be hooked to this book, although I didn't read the first book (and I will read it) while reading it you won't have any doubt of why Melody hated or loved her team persons.<br />I don't know how real is life within bigot organizations, but everything I've read is like what is written in this book so I think that Melody's experience in that camp could be true.<br />Another interesting thing in this reading is that JC puts all government people as they really are, sometimes human, sometimes selfish and most of the time ruthless but she does that without pushing too much the trait of every character.<br />Definitely I'll look forward to reading more of JC's books and I'll recommend her as a very good writer.<br /><br />So for me this book deserves six stars.	2005-01-18
Too many loose ends	Although the book is well written and you will learn some interesting things about your car's airbags. The book has too many loose ends and a love story that started from nowhere. I didn't like that love story because supposedly Joanna loved her husband and daughter and I don't think that in less than three days  you will drop your life for a person you will never see again.<br /><br />Albeit this is my first J.A. J's book and I think the answers to the next questions must be in another book. When you write a book and you tuck some questions, you must give the answers although they are in another book, so when you'll finish the book you will see that something is missing:<br /><br />What happened to Joanna's first husband?<br />Why did JP Beaumont's second wife tried to kill him?<br />What happened with Jack Brampton's body?<br />And I have many more questions.	2005-01-13
How many stars does this book deserve?	S#1)  The book will thrill you in all stories herein and non of them will get out of the main story for more than 1 minute reading.<br /><br />  S#2)  The story could be true and maybe to someone it was, the killing through the internet is a reality.<br /><br />  S#3)  Wherever you are, movies, friends, parties, you will only be thinking of what'll happen next in the book, you won't have an inkling, including the next line in the book.<br /><br />  S#4)  Almost in each chapter you'll find one or two twists in the plot.<br /><br />  S#5)  You won't know who the bad guy is until the very last page.<br /><br />  S#6)  You'll have a great time reading it because you wont be able to close it  till you finish it.	2005-01-08
Free... way	The story of the book is simply good. You will twitch your lips sometimes, but you can be sure that you will know every freeway and every street in LA and surroundings and that is a loss of time while reading. If you keep out all driving directions you will have a book of 200 pages, definitely not the best book written by RC.	2005-01-03
It'd be better if...	Albeit this is not the best Baldacci's book is a readable one, the first pages are heavy as lead though, but if you go through the first 150 or so pages the rest of the book is good enough to end it. You can also skip the part when the book explains how the economy works and what happen if the interest rate gets up or down. Maybe you will have to be in mood to read this one but at the end of it you will not regret reading it.<br />I think this book'd be better if were written after the WTC massacre.	2004-12-30
Hard to believe	I don't believe that a writer wrote only one story and all others 15 weren't written by him and everybody says that is a good book and a good writer.<br />All the stories are predictable and alike, if you read them all together at the end of the third one you will know the end of the rest of them only by reading the beginning, if you read these stories between books (one or two each time) may be you will enjoy the book, but maybe also you already read most of them before you read this book.	2004-12-27
Excellent novel	As all the Lucky's novels this one is excellent. You won't be able to put down the book until you finish it, JC has the ability to write five different stories in the book, merge all of them at the end of the book and keep you interested in all the stories and willing to read for more.	2004-12-27
Just good	The story of the counterfeiter is interesting but you can't say this is a real RC's thriller, the book will keep you reading but it has some voids and some parts that just couldn't be as easy as is written in the book (the way the mob accepted everything that Cole said), but this doesn't mean that is a boring story. Albeit is a good reading is not the best of this californian detective, may be is a good beach read, or in a long flight when you can read a while and rest a while.	2004-12-14
Just as the doctor ordered	If you see all my reviews of all RC's books that I have read, you will see that they are almost alike, when you finish one of these books you'll not want to go to any doctor at all, I have read many books written in this century (21st) that involve killing people to obtain their brains to make an \\"intelligent\\" computer, so if you think that this book is a \\"fairy tale\\" because it was written 25 years ago and it couldn't be possible you will get disappointed, maybe the explanation of how the computers work with the human brain is an easy way to explain it but you have to remember that this book was written in 1979, If you like these kind of books you can read Fountain Society by Wes Craven or Shadows by John Saul.	2004-12-07
Nice story	If you want to read a fairy tale that won't get you anything but a good reading time you can read this one, if this story could be true as it says JP at the end of the book I have my doubts.<br /><br />You will never know what experiments the scientists did to get a flying girl, but you will have a good time reading it. In this book you can also see the great imagination of the writer.<br /><br />The second book (The Lake House) is much more better.	2004-12-03
A heavy book to read	This book is based on a stark real story, so you can't say that what happened to Sandy is fair or not because they never found anything against her except what the people said she said, and maybe two or three coincidences that happened the day of the murder. Nevertheless, everything written in the book you will read it at least twice and that makes the book boring, albeit you'll understand the plot perfectly is not the way to write a book. JG wrote too many technical terms and that made the story slow and heavy and I really don't agree that this was the murder of the century in Vegas.	2004-11-29
Just a story	I can't tell you that this is a bad book, I can't tell you that is a waist of time, but also I can't tell you that this is an excellent read, the book will keep you reading but not thrilling you, the problem is when Reb said that he knew the answer of The Circles of Truth because Da Vinci told him how to solve the puzzle, since there, and that the last one hundred pages are just to waist paper you will only read the rest of it to finish the book, if you have an other book read it instead of this one.	2004-11-13
A six stars book from beginning till end	You will get hooked with this book since the prologue and you wouldn't let it down till you finish it, you will never expect what will happen in the next page and that is essential in a good read, no matter if at half of the book you will know who is the bad guy, because you will not know how he did the felonies.<br />In the other hand, living with a rapist that is following you and you know that, is hard enough to keep you reading, maybe the book has 2 or 3 boring pages, but that is all.	2004-11-11
I don't believe it	The first 50 pages of the book are thrilling, is a murder conspiracy and they made everything to complete their assignment, but when Mary decides to be the ambassador of Romania, the book get boring and boring unless you want to know how an ambassador must behave with everybody everywhere, when the book starts explaining this, you will get lost of the main story that has to many voids, of course as in these kind of books the end is a fairy tale and the epilog is made to keep the story open, sincerely I don't recommend this book, there are many spies books much better than this one.	2004-11-05
Excellent end	While you read about the investigation of the Poet crimes written by McCaleb you won't be able to put the book down, but at the end of the book, when you will know how McCaleb died  you will not believe it and of course will let many things into your imagination. Bosch's investigation is very good and it explains everything in the book, except why McCaleb went to the dessert alone, maybe we will know the answer in his next book.<br /><br />I give MC SIX stars for this one	2004-11-03
A six stars fairy tale	When you start a book and:<br /><br />1) You can't put it down.<br />2) You have a nice love story without sex.<br />3) You enjoy while reading.<br />4) Is a thriller although you know is a fairy tale.<br />5) You have a good time.<br />6) You have a smile at the end of it.<br /><br />  It deserves six stars.<br /><br />If you like these kind of books you can read Fountain Society by Wes Craven.<br /><br />I think that many readers saw this book and they thought that will be a police thriller and they had a deception because in this book wasn't Alex Cross, but the writers can change their writing patterns and write different kind of novels, for example: The Christmas Train by David Baldacci or Abduction by Robin Cook; these books went out of the writers's patterns and are excellent readings.	2004-10-29
Very bad end	The story of the book is excellent, although it has too many coincidences at the beginning of it, nevertheless, the abduction and all the problems with the hostages will keep you in the book and you will not be able to close it... until the abduction ends.<br />The last 30 pages could be written in 5 pages or less and that end just took away a star, you can end the book when the abduction ends and read the las two pages and you will have an excellent book.	2004-10-25
Definitely not JE's best book	I like reading Stephanie Plum's novels because although they don't have anything to learn or to think about you'll laugh while you read them,this book doesn't have jokes and the end is heavy as lead, grandma Mazur doesn't have the spark that has in other books, and at the end Morelli knew exactly what happened with the bad guys just because he is a cop. I think JE wanted to finish the book and just put an end to it.	2004-10-23
Just to have fun	The story of the book is completely out of reality, if you have a new phone number and all the calls are for a broad, the only thing you will do is to change that number as soon as you can, it doesn't matter if you had a sibling with the same problem, but if you want to help her and you find the mob I'm sure you will go away. Nonetheless you will have a good time reading it if you don't expect much of the story, maybe you can take this book to the beach and read it there.	2004-10-20
The grass is too green	When I read a book and I keep reading and I get nothing of the main story I say that the writer is green dyeing  the grass, since I already know that the grass is green with out dyeing it, I think that I don't have to read words that doesn't say anything, for example:<br /><br />The Jezzie-Alex's affair could be written in five lines at the beginning of the book and five more at the end so you can understand why she was a bad agent. The book has chapters and chapters of this affair.<br /><br />What happened with Alex's family is part of the book, but whatever they are going to have for breakfast every morning, who cares?<br /><br />The trial is boring and it repeats everything you already know.<br /><br />... And as the rabbit I can keep on and on...	2004-10-15
Very bad end.	The first 3/4 of the book are good enough not thrilling but you'll be entertained, the part that Dr. Judd is hearing the tapes of his patients is boring but you can stand it, but at the end, SS thought that he has written enough and that he has to end the book no matter what, so he ends it with a fight and who you think wins to a mob prizefighter?	2004-10-11
An endless end	The first part of the book is an excellent thriller, I'm talking about the first 200 pages, then when Langdon starts to follow the \\"angels\\" to the Illuminati's lair you will be a little bit bored because everything will repeat at least four times, nevertheless the book will keep you in the story until you get to the last 200 pages, then you will read and read and the book will never ends, and the last 50 pages or so are really very predictable, I think this book could be written with at least 100 pages less.<br /><br />THREE MISTAKES:<br /><br />1) Since the first page you will know that Vatican City will not be destroyed.<br /><br />2) The book never says the age of Langdon, but I assumed is about 50 years, if his father gave him a Mickey Mouse wrist-watch and this book was written in year 2000, I think that in 1960 there wasn't any Mickey Mouse wrist-watch with alarm. (IF I'M WRONG PLEASE LET ME KNOW)<br /><br />AND THE LITTLE BIG FATAL BLUNDER IS:<br /><br />3) THE NEW ORLEANS'S SUPERDOME WAS BUILT IN 1975 NOT IN 1960.<br /><br />BOOK RATINGS:<br /><br />1) DECEPTION POINT<br />2) DA VINCI CODE<br />3) DIGITAL FORTRESS<br />4) ANGELS & DEMONDS	2004-10-07
Good enough	She is not so well documented as Robert Crais or David Baldacci among others but this book will keep you reading, part of the story is the same as The Hammer of Eden by Ken Follett and that makes a little boring the story if you already read that book, that doesn't mean that you don't have to read this book if you  already read The Hammer of Eden.<br /><br />The end of the book is predictable but very good, is an easy book to read, not a thriller but good enough for a long flight or a day at the beach.	2004-09-30
Do you need a new medicine?	As all these kind of books you will think twice before you go to a MD. Albeit everybody think that a doctor must have some human thoughts the reality is very different and many of them just don't care about healing or harming someone.<br />The book's story will keep you reading but the surgeries are a little bit boring and the end of the book is very predictable but that doesn't mean that is a bad end.	2004-09-27
Knight Rider Chapter 2525	First of all this book is a Michael Knight's chapter with his KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) car, do you remember that TV program? The car that speaks, and drives herself?<br />Well with that in mind and that every JE's books had nothing to think about, nothing to learn about, but something to have a good time reading them you can read this book, this book will not give you anything but a pleasant time reading it, of course if you liked The Knight Rider Show, if you didn't like it just skip this one.	2004-09-19
A detective is always a detective	The story of a former agent who came back just to solve a case is quite different from all the detectives book I have read. The book will keep you in the story all the time and you will never guess the end of the book neither of the three of them. I can tell that MC is one of the best detective writers of our time, because at least myself couldn't catch him writing something unbelievable or completely out of reality.<br /><br />SIX STARS FOR THIS ONE.	2004-09-17
Not the best of JC	Definitely this is not the best book of JC, as all the books you read about Hollywood is always the same, sex, sex and deceive your couple no matter what, many stories of these couples are the same as in the book American Star of the same author, the only good part of the book the the killer, but is a real small story of him. The book keeps rolling among the same story of deceive for each couple and that makes the read heavy and boring. The book could be written with many pages less and with more thrillers in each story as American Star or any book in the Lucky story.	2004-09-10
Three points to review this book	1)  The Thriller<br /><br />The game part of the book is an excellent thriller, the way that the players play and the police investigate the crimes is excellent. Five stars for this part of the book.<br /><br />2) Predictable<br /><br />When the trial begins you will know who will win the battle, so this part of the book is boring because you will know the end of the trial no matter how good is the lawyers work.<br />When the trial becomes to an end you will know exactly what will happen with Christine. Two stars for this part of the book.<br /><br />3) The abduction<br /><br />When a person is abducted for one or two days you will read faster to see what happened with that person, when the abduction is for a week or a month you just stop thinking in the abducted person, but when the abduction is for more than a year and you already know how it'll end is just pathetic, and the way they found Christine is... you will know if you finish this book. Two stars for this part of the book.	2004-09-06
Copycat	This book is an excellent thriller, is a medical thriller only at the end of the book, everything that happens in the story involve doctors, but is not a complete medical thriller, the problem is that this book is a mix-up of two books written by Dr. Robin Cook, Shock and Mindbend, so if you already read these two books you can skip this one, but if you didn't read them or you only read one of them I can recommend this book.	2004-09-02
Excellent	This is the first book of Stephanie Plum that I read and have the two must important things that a book must have , the main story is very interesting and unpredictable and will keep you in the book all the time, the second story, her personal life will keep you laughing all the time, so you will not be bored while you read this book.	2004-08-30
A six stars thriller	Since you start this book till you'll end it, is an excellent thriller, all the stories involved, the Senator Saxton, NASA, The President, The White House and of course Rachel and Michael, are different kind of thrillers that will keep you reading all the time, of course as in many books are things that you will never know if are true or not, but fantasy is always a part of reading and writing, as in the Da Vinci Code you will learn two or three things about this world and the people who handle it.	2004-08-26
When will be your next check-up?	As many books of Dr. Cook, you won't be able to understand  many parts of the book unless you are a doctor, but this book is a complete medical thriller, I am agree that at the end of the book the story is a little bit boring and predictable, but as always with these kind of books, you will think twice before going to a doctor or hospital.<br />The book is really easy and fast to read, maybe you will stop doing things just to finish it.	2004-08-19
Just like magic	I have to admit that this book is much better than the Stone Monkey in every page, but as always with Rhyme's books you will never know exactly how he knew the true. This book is kind different of others because here you will learn something about magic, magicians and how they made the tricks, but this doesn't mean that the assassin plot of the book is bad.	2004-08-16
What a waste!	Could be a Spoiler the last line<br /><br />This book has exactly 304 pages, if you take away everything that doesn't has to do anything with the main story like how well can swim the kids in the sea, the illness of the baby, the family who found Emily's bracelet, the new house they wanted to buy, etc. The book could be written in less than 200 pages, and if you think that an eleven years kid can win a battle to a cop whom loves to kill is just pathetic.	2004-08-16
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... no, just six stars for this one	If you want to open a book and don't close it until you finish, try this one, you will get involved in the story and you will hate and love Wick and Rennie, but you will never expect what will be written in the next page, sometimes you will think that how a man whom recently had surgery could do what ever did Wick, but the book is so well written that that part doesn't matter. The end is amazing is the only thing I could tell.	2004-08-05
Half book is very good	The first half of the book is a page turner, the way the Three Blind Mice made the assaults are extremely well written, the way that Alex Cross makes all the investigations is quite good, but the other half, the love story with Jamilla, the illness of Nana Mama and the story of the marbles in the jar is boring and nonsense, in that part the book goes so many times out of the story that you almost forget it, maybe if JP didn't write all of these the book would be with less pages but will be a thriller from the first page to the last, by the way, as many books you can just skip the epilogue.	2004-07-31
A good story but... predictable	This story is not like others RC's medical thrillers in which some doctors are involved with something wrong about the practice of medicine, here is the mob who is using a doctor whom doesn't know what was happening. The story will keep you reading but many times you will know what will be written in the next page, many things of the plot can't be true as for example that anybody can go inside the back door of the morgue just like that, or in NY anybody could say to you that has to go to your home and you'll take him with you in your car and let him in, nevertheless is a good story to read.	2004-07-29
Too many pages	This book has 211 pages and some addendums that you can read or not depending on the mood you will be at the end of the book, so we will only count the 211 pages of the story.<br />The first 112 pages will tell you how to build a nuclear submarine and some tips on how to maneuver it. If you want to learn to do this it is fine to read it, but I think that if you only read this book to know how to build the nuclear sub you might find some trouble doing it.<br />The next 50 pages is the real story of what happened to the K-19 and it is interesting what was going on at the sub.<br />The last part of the book tells us why that happened  to the sub and tells us that the Russians didn't learn anything about this accident and maybe they had the same failure at Chernovil.<br />So, if you read from page 112 and read about 70 pages you will get the story.	2004-07-23
Just skip it	When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100% true, but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing. For an example I have these questions:<br /><br />  Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?<br /><br />  A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.<br /><br />  Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?<br /><br />  A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.<br /><br />  Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?<br /><br />  A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.<br /><br />  And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book.	2004-07-21
Very good story	The revenge of Leslie to Oliver is amazing, but more amazing is that at the end she didn't want to hear anything and that was part of her destruction even if she had in her wall an example of what is the wrongnest thing a journalist can do, she just did that.<br />The Sarajevo's part is long an a little boring but at least you will know something of that part of the world.<br />The plot has so many twists that you will be lost knowing who is who but you will never ever imagine this excellent end.	2004-07-19
A so so love story	The first part of the story , when Allison takes in her hand Ann's life so Ann can get into surgery is fine and funny, how Allison made all the thinkable mistakes she can done to her sister's fiance and after that, fix them, will keep you in the book, but when everybody knows that Allison was Ann and vice versa, and Allison went with Spencer in his yacht and all the do is kissing and kissing the book goes boring and boring, and the end is a love story's typical end.	2004-07-16
Good enough	I think that the story of the book is a little bit out of reality, I don't think that if the president's life  is threatened he will make his normal life and he will walk in Manhattan like a normal person, I also think that the people who works and live inside the White House are under investigation all the time and are followed by the security people in their spare time, so part of the story of the book doesn't have much sense. Nevertheless the book is a page turner and the end of the book, for me, was the only way to finish it, you will guess the end before you read it.	2004-07-15
Do you think you have privacy?	If the story of the book is real or don't it really doesn't matter, or tell me Cinderella is for real? I am agree that many things in this book are nonsense, for example if you go to Seville Spain you will see that Spain is a first world country non a third world country as DB wanted us to believe, I am also agree that the first half of the book is excellent, then the middle part is boring and predictable, and at the end is like an american movie, but the book will keep you interested in the story and even if the end is like a fairy tale is a very good end.<br />Do you thing that what you do in the internet or the emails you send nobody see them? Let me tell you that the first non written rule in any company (ask where you work) is: &quot;Do not send by email anything that you want to keep secret.&quot; In the big companies all the inbound or outbound email is checked, take that for sure.	2004-07-08
Turn left, no, turn right...	This amazing story made so many turns that you will be airsick, nevertheless you won't be able to close the book until you finish it. For each problem solved in the book appear two more to solve, even at the very last page, the last problem is unsolved.<br />The way SB writes this novel, the problems of Kendall (is that her name?) The way John keeps going his illness to know more about Kendall is really unique, thinking better I can give six stars to this book and look for more of its kind.	2004-07-05
Not a happy ending	I agree with most of the reviewers that this is not the best of JP's books  , but even so, this book will keep you reading, it is a very fast read and you will be interested in each page, the story about  the Red Mafia could be real; anything in these days could be real.The book has some unsolved murders that I think is just to give the Wolf more power. Why didn't they  use Elizabeth to know exactly who the Wolf was?<br />The end is kind of sad with his son and very sad about what happened to the Wolf, but remember not all the endigs are happy.	2004-06-30
A dire story	I think this is the ugliest story that I ever read although I knew the story of the book before reading it, but just think to put my kids in an attic for more than three years all by them selves just because I will win one trillion dollars is insane (at least for me), but not only that, try to kill all of them is just lunatic.<br />The way the kids learned to live there changing the attic according to each season of the year is cute but at the same time very sad, indeed all the book is really sad but very well written I can tell you that this book will put you real down just to think what a mother can do to her children just for money, when she went to the attic and tell the kids that she went to Europe I really close the book for a while and think about an insane mother.	2004-06-28
A six stars Xmas story	Although I don't celebrate Xmas, this book is the best story of Xmas I ever read or saw at the movies, maybe someone must make a flick of this book, the story of Sam will have you in the book all the time, the way everybody travels in a train (that's true, I know because I was on one) and have no secrets to the strangers at the lounge car or the dinning car.<br />When you are reading the love story of Tom and Ellie you will think that is a little bit foolish everything that happened to them in the train, but at the end of the book you will have a smile at your face.	2004-06-22
Just to have a good time	One of the best things of reading is to have a good time, enjoy the reading and laugh now and then, so that's the description of this book.<br />The main story is nonsense, the lost package and the way they lost it and the way they found it is foolish, but you will laugh meanwhile, all the stories of grandmother Manzur are indeed hilarious and I think that many of them think alike but they don't say anything.<br />The investigation, policemen and the lovers of Stephanie is worthless, but you will laugh a lot while reading this.	2004-06-18
Sorry but this is just a boring biography	This book is a biography of a woman who went to America to try to live well... and she did that, her story is simple, sometimes boring and the main part of the story is pathetic, why? Because when she was married she had and affair that she didn't want, you feel that she was almost rape and with that relationship she had a baby and you will feel sorry for her, but then she went again with the same man and continue her affair until her husband dies, when he dies she decide that she won't have another affair, why she does that? Because all she wanted was to deceive her husband and when he past away the affair doesn't mean nothing because she didn't deceive anybody?	2004-06-14
Sad and predictable	Predictable:<br />Although this is the first book that I read of the series and I don't know if a will read the first three, I can say that you will know exactly what will happen in the next page of the book since the beginning till the end, nevertheless the book will keep you reading and trying to guess what will happen next, of course I would make some changes to the end of the book.<br />Sad:<br />First of all is very sad that two brothers love each other in other way than brothers, how many times a woman can be a widow? How many times can a mother catch her daughter in bed with her boyfriend? And  I'm not talking about the accidents, the way that Bart made everything his own way... and many things more. This book will really make you cry.	2004-06-11
Repeating, repeating and repeating.	The story of the book is about two twins that were separated in the hospital, why or how it doesn't really matters, it also doesn't really matters if they were twins, cousins or friends, when they find out that they were brothers you will be so bore that you will don't care.<br />The two biographies are the same but in different schools, how many campaigns could anyone write in a book? three, four, five? What happened with JA? How many girls will be pregnant in the last year of college? All of them? They go to college just to have sex? Come on Mr. Archer, this is your first book?<br />I will not say anything about the end because I don't have enough words to say it.<br />If you want to read a book of twins read The Hancock Boys by Thomas William Simpson	2004-06-03
?Que qu? vio la mujer de Lot?	La verdad es que como no vale la pena este libro les dar? la respuesta: nadie sabe lo que vio mas que ella misma.<br />El principo del libro es interesante pues habla de la vida extraterrestre (si es que existe) y de como ?sta estuvo presente en el principio de la vida del Hombre, yo no digo que no exista vida fuera de la Tierra, pero todas las teor?as del escritor se basan en los rusos, el libro fue escrito en los setentas y en 2004 ya sabemos que la mitad de las investigaciones rusas fueron inventadas, pues tambi?n sabemos que en Marte no hay vida ni hojas ni nada, cosa que los rusos y el escritor afirmaban en 1975.<br />?Por qu? no se bas? el escritor en la NASA?<br />?De d?nde decidi? el escritor que los rusos eran los de mejor tecnolog?a cuando ahora sabemos que no es cierto?<br />Definitivamente este libro hab?a que leerlo antes de los ochenta y lo m?s recomendable ahora seria quemarlo.	2004-05-28
How naive are some men	The first two parts of the book are great, the story of Amanda and Maggie, but the last part is boring and boring, everybody who read this book have to know that Robin will never do anything with Judith.<br />How Judith's husband never knew anything? If you are the president of any big company the first thing that you have to do is to have your eyes open, with your wife and with anybody, here JS put Judith's husband as a stupid naive, and that kind of persons can't be the president of anything.<br />I can't tell you that this could be real or not, but how many times a man can deceive a woman and at the end that woman (Maggie)will return to him (Robin), the same end was in the Valley of Dolls and I didn't like it either.	2004-05-27
Just a reading	This short story is not a thriller but will keep you reading all the time, if you read this book in a long flight you could end it in that flight.<br />The story don't have any message and the end is not excellent but is good enough, of course nobody knows what anybody will do in case that he knows that is going to die, you can't say that Chavel is guilty of what he did.	2004-05-23
Could it be real?	Do you really know what happened between 1995 and sept 10 2001.<br />As many the books of FF you will never know if this book is real or not, but what you will really know is that you could not leave the book until the end, it has two or three things about Vietnam that are really ugly, but the way that FF writes is unique and no matter how ugly he describes the things that happened, you will read them.<br />The story of the avenger is sad, as all the avengers, but real good, since Vietnam till the end of the book, the story of the rest of the characters is good but not as good as the avenger.	2004-05-20
Strange book	Have you ever read a book that you don't like at all and you can't stop reading it?<br />Well, this book is a story of three brothers that are MD, the big one make anything he wants, everybody loves him and everything that he does is always perfect (that story is pathetic).<br />The second brother nobody likes him he is always fighting with everybody but he wants to make good to all the people no matter if they have or don't money (this is the story that really counts and the one that make me read the book)<br />Their sister, just skip all the pages she is included, it doesn't say anything.<br />At first of the story you will think that this book will be about medical cases and corrupt doctors, but after 100 pages you will see that the book is the story of these three brothers and what is written of medical problems is minimum, so if you decide to read this book don't expect a medical book, expect a novel of a story of one selfish doctor, one regular doctor and the other one (the sister) just don't read it.	2004-05-15
At the end the writer misses the point	The book is good at the beginning, I can't tell you that it goes out of the story because everything written in the book is related to the story, but some parts of the book are really boring.<br />Everybody knows that in Vegas the mob owns the hotels & casinos at least at first, but what I really don't believe is that the casinos now, at this moment are the cleanest business in the country, maybe they don't take the money as 30 years ago, but I'm sure that in Vegas are many tricks with the bets and the money no matter if now in Vegas have one theme park in every hotel & casino.<br />At the end of the book, if  the wife of \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal was killed or not, who really cares?	2004-05-11
Nothing special	I have to admit that this book will keep you interested in the story and you will laugh two or three times, but it also have to many things that are pathetic, like Sunny going up in the elevator space.<br />At first you will be happy reading the book and all the things that happened to this three kids, but the end of the book is one of the worst ends I ever read, that doesn't mean that you can't have a good time reading this book, that means that LS must think other ways to finish their books, because when you read a regular book and the end is bad, the book is also bad.	2004-05-06
James Bond	The plot of the book will keep you reading, at first the three stories will make you ask many things about the real plot, but when the three stories merge and start the main story of the book you won't be able to leave the book, nevertheless, at the end of it is like a James Bond movie with a new star Sean Dillon instead of Sean Connery.<br />The story is good but it has his details that any secret agent would never do, for example to trust blindly Asta and try her to be against her step father.<br />Read it!	2004-05-04
A waste of the art	First of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 100 pages less, taking that little part away, how could ten art experts buy a fake copy of a paint. They don't study how to recognize a fake?<br />The book has too many stories and everybody make wrong things and they go against all the laws and nobody does nothing, that is unreal.<br /><br />S P O I L E R: don't read the next text unless you already read the book<br /><br />How can anybody steal one million dollars and no one does nothing? Or even worse, they forgive the thieves just for the value of the real paints. That is pathetic.	2004-05-01
This must be the first book to read...	I like all kind of medical thrillers, I like Palmer, Cook, Sheldon (Nothing  Last Forever) and of course Crichton, when I started to read these kind of novels, many times I had to go to the dictionary to understand many medical descriptions, or ask some friends what does it mean this or that in the hospital, this book explain all that and after you read it you will understand  many things about hospitals and doctors, this book doesn't say anything against  any doctor as other medical thrillers, in this book you see how the doctors try  to help themselves and their medical friends.<br />The case of the abortion is  good, nevertheless you will not know exactly how John knew who was the bad guy, he just found it, so, at the end you will be a little disappointed but you will learn many things about doctors, for example: do you really know why the clothes of the M.D. are white?	2004-04-24
A six stars writer	Definitively RC is a six stars writer, the way he explains what are thinking all the characters at the same action in the book is excellent, the way he combine the characters of L.A. Requiem and Demolition Angel and explain them the easiest way so you don't have to read these books to understand this one is also excellent.<br />The story of the kidnap and the way everybody is related to that won't let you put the book down until you finish it, but when the book is done, you will ask for more.	2004-04-22
Good reading for your vacations	This is an excellent book for your vacations because you can leave the book whenever you want and take it back when you don't have anything else to do, this book is not a page turner but if you start it you will end it.<br />The messages of the book are very nice and you and your children can learn something about the book. As all the books of CH is easy and fast to read, it will keep you interested in the story of the owls and the new restaurant that other people want to build in that space.	2004-04-19
Good fight... if they weren't husband &amp; wife	I am agree that this is not a thriller, but is not a book that if you put down you will never want to take it back again, the plot of the book is very interesting and I really don't know if husband and wife can fight in a trial, one as a lawyer and the other as a prosecutor, if this is true I think that that law has to be modified, maybe it would be a better novel if they will be only friends or maybe they want to get married.<br />The dead of Conrad is foolish and the end of the book is like a fairy tale and those ends I just don't like them, I like when the end of the book leave something to your imagination, something that you can end the book as you want.	2004-04-17
The unsolved history	In this book both stories are unsolved, Why did Julia kill herself? Harry is really sure who was the killer of the kid?<br />As many books of MC you will see that not all the police are good men, many of them just want to do things to get higher in the department no matter if in the way some one gets killed. Some times some police men wanted to work with out his partners, I think that that is not a working team no matter the reason, if you have a partner you must work with him.<br />This book is definitely a page turner, even if the case is really unsolved it has his high thrilling points and his down crying points, with this book you will laugh a little and cry a little too. The investigations has so many turns, ups and downs that you would never put the book down, but as all the MC books, you can skip the last two chapters.	2004-04-15
Just a bad book	The beginning of the book is interesting and a good story, but when appear Larry Lucas and he just wanted to die because the life is to hard for him is really pathetic, he wanted to do everything good for his family and the only thing he did was very wrong.	2004-04-12
Cute story	This book will keep you reading, the story of the space war is not new but is kind of different, the way that the Generals made that Ender fight the war and the way they trained him is excellent, it has many things that doesn't have to be written, for example that 6 years old kids didn't wanted to be naked, I think that it doesn't have to be any kind of nudity in this book, another thing is that even if Ender and everybody in that school were geniuses I think that they couldn't work so hard with any mental illness after that work.<br />The book is predictable in many parts, so if you read this book only to have a good time, like watching toons is ok, if you expect anything else, just skip it.<br />The end of the book is a little bit long.	2004-04-12
Welcome back Linda	The last book of LH that I read was Open Season, what a waste! Since then I was waiting for a new book, and this one was amazing, it has some boring parts that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, but the book will almost all the time keeps you reading and wondering how it will be in your house a female butler... and bodyguard, the way that Cahill thinks that Sarah is the killer, and the way that Sarah defend herself just LH knows how to write it.	2004-04-10
Excelentemente bien escrito	La trama del libro es de una ni&ntilde;a que dice una mentira y manda a su t&iacute;o que es ciego a prisi&oacute;n diez a&ntilde;os, en prisi&oacute;n le hacen todas las cosas malas que se puedan y cuando sale no sabe hacer otra cosa que drogarse y prostituirse.<br />El libro est&aacute; perfectamente bien escrito y te va a mantener en la historia, aunque est&eacute;s en el cine no vas a poder pensar en otra cosa que el libro, y como en pocos libros el final est&aacute; excelente, con l&aacute;grimas y todo.<br />Realmente este libro merece seis estrellas.	2004-04-10
Why not finish by herself?	This book has extreme points, first the good ones:<br />You will read and enjoy most part of the book, is not a page turner but you will laugh while you read, the book won't make you leave the reading and not wanting to start it again.<br />The bad things:<br />When Challen punished Tedra exciting her but not letting her finish as she wanted, why she was awake all night so excited, why couldn't she finished her excitement by herself? I think here that JL could find another kind of punishment.<br />The futuristic part of the book is a little foolish, that is worst while you read that my first point.	2004-04-02
The third part is missing	The first part of this book is readable not  a thriller but good, it has to many pages that doesn't have to do with the story of  the lost city, the cave and the treasure but you can read it. The second part of the book, the dream of Benjamin Kazin is just a waste of time, but I have to admit that WS has a lot of imagination.<br />The problem of this book is that doesn't have an end, what happened with the cave? The lost city? The treasure?	2004-03-29
Too many endings	The book is very well written until the first end (you will know when is the first end of the book), in this part you will laugh and have a very pleasant time reading the story of Colin of Berkamshire and Alinore of Solonge, I have to say that this love story has his ups and downs but you won't be able to put the book down.<br />The problem is that the first end of the book is about a hundred pages before the last end, and these last one hundred pages took off two stars to this book, this book has three endings, and I really don't know why she had to finish this book in that way, she just take the smile of your face doing that.	2004-03-26
Almost a book	This story is out of reality at any time, it has an almost love story, almost FBI thriller, almost futuristic, almost childish, and I can keep going about almost everything, apart of that, you can skip almost half of the book and you will understand it, so to resume this review, this book is a complete (not almost, complete) waste.	2004-03-26
The friendly ghost	This is a nice, short and easy story to read, it will show you the way people think about themselves and about others, you can read this fairy tale while waiting in the airport, it won't take you more that an our to read it, OK, maybe two hours and you will have a smile after you finish the book.	2004-03-20
What a waste!	This book tells us a story of some terrorist that kidnap five girls in France and ask for five things, each thing that the french people does they release a girl, the problem with this story is that the french people wanted to make an international problem and they made all the meetings in New York and nobody in the world care except Israel, In this book never goes out the secret service of any country, the French police makes all the arrangements and they solve the case, just boring.<br />This is the first book that I read that the prologue doesn't has anything to do with the rest of the book, so you can skip this part of the book as well as other 100 pages that just have words that doesn't have to do anything in the book.<br /><br />SKIP this book, it doesn't worth it.	2004-03-18
Not the way to write a book	Some stories of the book are terrifying, some are boring and many of them are alike, some of the killers are important celebrities, some of them just kill once and some of them kill just a dozen, but when you finish the book you won't care anything about these killers, why? Because when you read 10 or 15 stories you will know how will be the next story in this book. RGJ wrote to many stories just because all of the killers were women and he wanted to write many pages, but he might write just the celebrities or the serial killers, but he went through the past and if he found a woman who kills somebody he just wrote it in the book, that is not the way to write a book.	2004-03-15
Nice story excellent message	You can read this book in a day... or maybe faster, is a nice story and above everything the message that has this book is excellent, why not make a wish come true to someone you love? Or even more difficult, make that wish to someone you don't love, make good things to others, just try once and you will feel better, I really know that.	2004-03-13
The second book was much better	I read first El Reino del Dragon de Oro and I like that book very much, then I read this one and the first part is very good, but the second half of the book is just boring, when Alex and Nadia went with the natives and they want to make you feel that they live better than any civilization is just pathetic, and I won't tell anything about the \\"invisible Nadia\\" the last 100 pages could be written in 50 or less pages. If I read first this book I would never read the second one.	2004-03-11
Almost excellent	All the book is excellent, it will keep you reading all the time and you will always want to know what will happen in the next page, but it has two big mistakes, the first one is that you know exactly what happened with the kidnap when the FBI make his investigations and deductions, you know what deductions are good and what aren't, the second mistake is the end of the book, Baldacci must thought another reason for the kidnapping.	2004-03-08
Touching	This is a nice story where you can see the mistakes of your life, because each character has his own problems, some of them are important and some of them not and one of them could be yours, while you read this book you will remember your high school days.<br />If you read this book expecting a best seller novel you will be disappointed, this book is a story and if you don't look in the message of the story you won't like this book, I think that this book is for air planes, just read it while you flight and relax, there is a part that you will only read about football and if you don't like that game you won't understand that part, but is worth it to read this book.	2004-03-04
Not my style	When you read a book and whatever you are reading doesn't say anything is a waist of time, half of this book is written that way, maybe the stories are good, but when you read and read and nothing happen or explain things that you already know (Like all the names of the streets in NY city) I said that the grass is to green, why? Because everybody knows that the grass is green, you don't have to read it in a book, reading these kind of \\"grass\\" makes the story boring and you don't want to know what will happen in the real story of the book, this is a really waste of time, paper and money for this book.	2004-03-03
Terrifying... sometimes	The first part of the book when Charles Monet goes to Kitum cave and get the Marburg virus is a good book, but after that the book keeps repetitive and goes out of the story so many times that is very difficult to finish it... but I did, the main story, the research of the Ebola, the way they keep everything in secret and how they work with the wild monkeys is very interesting if you can find that story (this book could be written with 150 pages less), but at the end of the book you will be as at first, nothing can be done against these two virus.	2004-03-02
Very real	Because I am the first reviewer I will make a book description:<br /><br />In the first flight from USA to Peking (Beijing) are on board the vice-president of the US and many congress man and some secret of the US government, it also goes in the plane the president of the air company, because of the people on board, the plane has 2 pilots instead of one co pilot and with the passengers goes a former pilot of the company.<br />In the middle of the ocean explodes and engine, and the problem is not the people, is the secret cargo of the plane...<br /><br />This book is easy and fast to read, you will learn two or three things about airplanes and the most important thing is that always a pilot is flying the plane, not as many books that any passenger could flight a plane (that is pathetic but many books do that).<br /><br />As many books the writer wanted to end the book as a fairy tale and leave nothing to the imagination, I recommend to skip the last chapter of the book.	2004-02-26
Verry good thriller	I read first The Red Dragon and I like it very much, then I read Hannibal and I didn't like it so I didn't want to read this book, but it happens, someone give it to me and I read it, and what a book! you wont be able to put it down and maybe you will never go to a psychotherapist again, the story is not out of reality at all, the descriptions of the bodies are excellent, so don't read this book late at night.	2004-02-23
Nice fairy tale	This book is better than the first one, maybe is because you know what are you going to read, nevertheless is a fairy tale but better, here you see the love that a boy can have for his father and do whatever he needs to do to save him, I recommend this book to read it when you need some relax, because you won't have to think anything while you read, is a very easy book to read.	2004-02-19
Poor book	AT first you think that you are going to read about some secret agent in Vietnam that was killed, but when you see that the story of the book is not that man, is a journalist from England that doesn't want to go back to his country you will be disappointed, the book doesn't have any main story, it has the story of the journalist, his girlfriend (who was also the girlfriend of the \\"secret agent\\") and many more, but you will not be interested in one story at all, a real waste of time this book.	2004-02-19
Almost excellent	The story of the book is good, the way that Trevor makes his homework is amazing, the love story between Reuben and Arlene is fair enough, but the las two chapters and the epilogue you just can skip them, they make the story like a fairy tale, don't leave anything to your imagination, I think that is a big mistake.	2004-02-16
Breakfast anywhere	I can't tell you that this is a good book, but I can tell you that has a strong message: you can do whatever you want to do without hurting anybody and you will have an easier life, but if you hurt yourself while living this way, you will lost everything you have, because you will not like anything that you have until you lose it.<br />The story of Holly is like many real stories that I know, so the only person who really know if she were happy or not is Holly.<br />The book is easy to read but not as good as I thought.	2004-02-16
The message is good but...	The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one.	2004-02-11
The main story is fine but...	The main story of this book is good, in the present time is very good and will keep you reading, but the past time, the biographies, the introduction to each chapters is very slow and boring, it goes out of the main story so many tiems that I really don't know why I finished this book, the end of it will not let you leave the book if you get to that part, it has some mistakes like why Anna wanted the main story if she already has it.	2004-02-10
A six star novel	Excellent work by Anne Stuart, this book will keep you reading all the time, and when you can't read it because you are at work or at the movies, you will think about what will happen next in the book. The way that Alex-Sam makes his plans to know the truth about his life will not let you forget about the book until you finish it.	2004-02-07
Time Tunnel chapter 2525	If you are old enough to remember the TV show The Time Tunnel you will agree with me that this book is just one chapter of that program.	2004-02-06
Who is really insane	I think that many people think that the people is insane just because they are in their own world, I know that many people suffer of sever head problems, but many of them are just different from us and we think that they have to be at the hospital, as is written in the book, how many times you wanted to do something different and you didn't just because of the people? How many times you did what you wanted to do no matter the people? The difference to do anything different and not going to the hospital is not hurting anybody, even yourself.<br />This is a very easy and fast book to read I recommend this book in a long flight.	2004-02-06
No time for this book	This book was written more than fifty years ago, and the events has at least seventy years, but even at this time almost everybody think and act like seventy years ago, so if this book were written by other writer and say that is happening now you would believe it. The big problem of the book is that all those cases were for real, the people don't think if they are wrong, they want to judge the people just for their color , race or religion, is that OK with you?<br />The book is a little bit heavy in some parts, but is always in the story and never goes out just to fill pages, Excellent book.<br /><br />By the way, in the packages of Camel cigarettes is indeed a man, the feet of the man are in the hind ones of the camel, the man is in an obscene position.	2004-01-30
Not a good end	As always I read a medical book I will think twice before going to a doctor, the story of the super vaccine that is not tested correctly is amazing and it could be true in the basis that everybody works for money and the laboratories will not wait five years or more to test any new drug.<br />The book will keep you interested in the both stories, the mine and the vaccine, but sometimes it describes some medical procedures that nobody will do them unless the doctors, I think those parts could be written shortly.<br />The end of the book is like a fairy tale, for me these kind of books have to put some doubt to the reader about the drugs that one take.	2004-01-26
A fast book to read	The book will keep you reading but many times it goes out of the main story and that makes a little bit boring the story, the story of the lost sword is good, but at the end I think that the writers just wanted to end the book and say that the sword was made from alien materials. It's not the best book but if you start this book you will end it because taking out the boring parts, the story of the island and the pirates will keep you interested, and is a really easy and fast book to read.	2004-01-22
To many pages	This book has to many pages to tell us that story, the first part of the book, when Ari Ben Canaan rescue some young jewish boys and send them to Palestine is very interesting and it will have you reading all the time, but when the writer writes why Ari does what he does, and the biography of his life starts since his grandparents (that he never saw) is boring and boring, this part of the book is written in more than 100 pages, the second half of the book is worst, describes the story of the independence of Israel and the problems with the english army and all the arabs, this part of the book has more than 350 pages, this story is written in the book  Jews, God and History by Max I. Dimont in less than 100 pages, so if you already read that book, you don't have to read this one.<br />The \\"love\\" story of Ari and Kitty is not even a story.	2004-01-19
Five stars is not enough for this book	Definitely this book deserves SIX stars, it will keep you reading from the first page till the last one, involves all the presidents of the world and even with that is an easy book to read, but here are my questions:<br /><br />Why could this happened 25 years ago and not right now? I think that this book is timeless.<br />What does the president will really do?<br />What does the Police, FBI and CIA among others will really do? They really know how to handle this kind of problem?<br />All the countries will respect the president's decision?<br /><br />Read this book and think about these questions.	2004-01-14
Incre&iacute;ble	El libro trata de una arque&oacute;loga (Sharon) que encuentra un esqueleto y piensa que es de Cristo, entonces del Vaticano mandan a un cura (Jim) para que verifique si es cierto o no, despu&eacute;s de meses de investigaci&oacute;n, Jim y Sharon se enamoran y pasa lo que tiene que suceder cuando dos personas se enamoran, durante la investigaci&oacute;n de los huesos aparece un agente de la KGB el cual Jim no conoce y le dice a Jim que se robe los huesos y adem&aacute;s que su amante es una esp&iacute;a, lo incre&iacute;ble es que Jim le cree sin decir nada. Al final el libro mismo dice que es una novela sin bases reales, no vale la pena perder el tiempo en este libro.<br />Si quieren leer un buen libro del mismo tema lean El C&oacute;digo Da Vinci de Dan Brown.	2004-01-13
Does it really exist the jewish God?	Does it really exist the jewish God?<br />While you read this book you will see that whenever the jewish people had a strong problem, almost from magic appear a man who made whatever it has to be done, spoke to everybody who has to be spoken and the jewish people save their problem. Who sent these persons exactly the time the jews needed? Why nobody can destroy the jews in 4,000 years and are the only people that survive that long?<br />I think the answer is yes.<br />While you read this book you will understand the history of the jews, why they think their way, and why they survived to all the history problems they had or even they have now, at the end of the book are to many biographies that make the finish of the book long and boring, but the main story of the book is amazing, but you have to have in mind that is a very hard book to read, you will have to be concentrated in the book, you won't be able to read it while hearing music or something else, you will have to be 100% in the book.	2004-01-08
You will know the end	The story of this two brothers is amazing. Nevertheless you'll know the end of it at half book and that makes you lose some interest in the book. It has too many coincidences but the book will keep you reading all the time. It has to many characters and that makes the book a little hard to read. The point that I didn't like it and at the end I did, was their wife, since the start of the book I had a question: how two men can do exactly the same to a woman in bed? And the second question was: how a woman can't feel the difference between two men in bed? You will see the answer at the middle of the book. One of the answers I won't tell you which is amazing and the other is that either John and Will are really stupid or their wife is.	2004-01-02
Una historia bonita	Como de costumbre, siempre leo primero la segunda parte y luego la primera, por lo que creo que es como otros libros que la parte que se lea primero es la mejor, la historia que cuenta sobre el &quot;Hombre de las nieves&quot; y lo que sufren por encontrarlo, as&iacute; como la historia del Drag&oacute;n es bonita, siempre est&aacute; intereseante y uno nunca deja de aprender algo nuevo sobre nuestro mundo, culturas y sobre todo en lo distinto que somos las personas, desde las que s&oacute;lo les interesa el dinero hasta las que s&oacute;lo les interesa el bienesatar de todos, es un alibro &aacute;gil de leer, claro que me falta el primero para compararlo y ver si no es el mismo tema s&oacute;lo que en el Amazoneas, ya lo ver&eacute;...	2003-12-31
Just a book	When you start this book is an excellent book, but when it stars with fairy tales, you have two options, you leave the book or you read it with other mind, with a childish mind, if you do the second point as I did you will enjoy reading this book, that's for sure, the book will not give anything but a good time while you read, but is not what anybody want while reading a book?	2003-12-31
What a story!	If this book is real, what a book! If it's not real it doesn't matter, you will not be able to put down this book until you finish it, the story of Jaye who didn't know that she was adopted until 33 years old is amazing, and I think that is not easy know that you are adopted at that age, the story was kind of new to me and well written, the book is not going out of the story and is an easy book to read, I recommend this book whenever you want to read it. very nice reading.	2003-12-21
An alien invasion without aliens	Kind of different alien invasion, I have to admit that this book is very different of all aliens books, but the end of it is really out of reality and the love story of the book is completely pathetic, nevertheless the book will keep you reading to the end, but you will be disappointed with that end, and the final question is: where are the aliens? Read this book on your vacations and that will be fine with this book.	2003-12-19
Boring, repeating, repeating, boring	The story of this book is that two persons decided to measure the earth (from the North Pole to the Ecuador), divide that length by 10 million and that would be the length of the meter, they will need a year to do that, after seven years that one went to the north of France and the other to the south of Spain (to measure that part of the Earth and calculate the rest to the Pole and the Ecuador) they had a mistake of 2 millimeters in the length of the meter, those 2 millimeters mean a mistake of the measure of the Earth of more than 2,000 Km. (1,250Mi), so in the first year they could say what is the length of the meter with out doing any measure, why? Because one of them saw his mistake and change all his calculations to put them more or less exactly as the other person.<br />This story you will read it in more than 350 pages.<br />Meanwhile in the book says how they do their measure about 100 times and I don't think many people will understand those measures, first of all because you never know which unit of measure they used, and it also explains the french revolution and things that really doesn't have to do with the story of the meter length.	2003-12-09
Why six stars?	Why six stars to this book?<br /><br />1)  It has too many people involved, but the book explain perfectly who they are and you know exactly what are they doing and why.<br /><br />2)  It never goes out of the story and it has three different stories that will keep you very busy.<br /><br />3)  You will be interested in all the people of the book, not only Talley or the terrorists.<br /><br />4)  You won't be able to put down the book until you finish it.<br /><br />5)  It has no sex scenes that many writers write just to fill pages.<br /><br />6)  IT IS A GREAT BOOK, JUST FOR THAT.	2003-12-05
This is not the first book with this story	This book is not the first with this story that I read, The Prophetess by Barbara Wood is alike but I think that this book is better, whether if you are agree or not with this story, this book will keep you reading all the time and you won't be able to put it down.<br />I can't tell you that this story ia real or not, but you really can? May be you will not be agree with this story, (I am not telling that I am, but I'm not telling you that I'm not) but you have to know what other people think about any religion and<br />think about it. This book is amazing in the things of the past, and what really happened 2,000 years ago is very difficult to verify, I think that this book deserves SIX STARS because is a book that will make you think, and as I said before, is not the first one with this theme, so the question is: why other writers wanted to do this job if it is not true?	2003-11-30
Another six stars book by Baldacci	Excellent book! You won't be able to stop reading, and while you are reading you will never guess who are the bad guys and who are the good ones until the very end, the book never goes out of the story and it doesn't have any love story just to fill pages, but it has to many coincidences, but that doesn't take any star, enjoy this book, but you have to have in mind that if you start reading it you won't be able to stop it till the end.	2003-11-26
Can you call this a book?	The first part of the book is good, when Stark is looking for Alkland, but when Stark decides that Alkland has a problem with his dreams the book is boring and so it keeps till the end, how can a person write so many words and don't say anything? I don't know why I finished this book, but I did. Sincerely, this book is a waste of time.<br />About the future? This book doesn't have anything about that, everything happened in Stark's dreams and in the dreams there are no future, present or past.	2003-11-22
Good beginning, regular story, bad ending	The beginning of the book is good, so it hooked you to continue, but the rest of the story is boring and guess what, at the end they get married, come on, you can't write that way a book, if you really want to read an excellent love story with an enchanted sword read Until Forever by Johanna Lindsey and you will see the difference between two girls that had a sword and a story to tell.	2003-11-18
Do you think you have problems?	If you think that you have problems with your family check this:<br /><br />Five children, one homosexual, one likes drugs, one is dead in a war, one hate her mother because her mother is a winner in life and the last one more or less normal, but these are not all the problems...<br />The story of Faye is well written and the book is very easy to read, it has two or three things that I think couldn't be true but the story of this family will make you think of your family and if you really have problems with your children, this book will open your mind of what to do or how to do things with your children, husband or wife.	2003-11-13
From 5 stars to 3	The first three quarters of the book are very good, they will keep you reading all the time, but the last quarter when Harry decides that he is better than SWAT is really pathetic, if you read this book, don't get disappointed with that pathetic end.	2003-11-08
Just nothing to say	I can't say anything of this book, or almost anything, in the first 20 pages you know who is the bad guy and the book keeps rounding and rounding 400 more pages until they finally discover him, I really don't recommend reading this book.	2003-11-04
Very good	This is the kind of books I like, it never goes out of the story with descriptions and descriptions that the only thing they do is to fill pages that the writer doesn't know how to fill, the end of the book is not so good but the rest of it will keep you reading, and the final question is: could it be possible in the near future?<br />As we can see in this book, with this kind of technology everybody will suffer sooner or later, because nobody can say to another person how to live his life, no matter if you think exactly like the other person or you know how or what thinks that person.	2003-11-03
What a waste	This book is a waste of time, trees, paper and money, let's begin:<br />The first part of the book is more or less regular, with that in mind and that the book has 400 pages or so and it could be written in less than 50 we will continue.<br />The book goes out of the main story so many times that you really don't know which was that story, I would throw this book to the waste basket but this book wasn't mine so at least I didn't waste my money.<br />The end of the book is just pathetic.<br />P.S. I put two stars to this book because I know what is writing a book and just for writing it it has two stars.	2003-10-29
Nice and easy	This is a nice and easy reading, you could read it in one or two days at the beach or in a long flight, the story of the four brothers Stanford is almost unreal but you will have a great time reading the stories and that is why you read a book.<br />The end of the book is really amazing, when the lawyer reads the will of Harry, it is a good book that make you think.	2003-10-27
Just his style	As all the medical thrillers written by R. Cook, this is amazing, and is amazing because after you read this book you will think twice if you want to take a medicine that affects your brain.<br />The story of Elizabeth was much better than the story of Ultra, but the story of Elizabeth was quite longer so you will be reading this book page after page, but think twice before taking any pill, and think it three times if you are pregnant.	2003-10-25
Good writing, good reading, good book	This book has the seal of Michael Connelly, it has to many turns, but the problem with that is that you know that if the book has many pages left, the person who they thought was the bad guy it is not.<br />This book will keep you reading and interested in the story and the clues that they discover are visible, you will understand why, not like Jeffery Deaver's detective  Rhyme who deduct the things from nowhere and you sometimes not understand why.<br />At the end of the book you will see that politics are politics and nobody can change that.	2003-10-23
Just relax and read	You won't take anything of this book but you will have a good time reading it and that is the greatest part of reading a book, the story of Carmel is nice and will keep you reading while she is in England and Australia, when she return to England and discover the assassination the story gets a little boring but still is a good reading, you won't know the time of the book until the last page, I think that that was a good idea.<br />By the way, which girl wouldn't want to have three options of marriage in less than two weeks?	2003-10-18
So what?	Here we have a woman who didn't know if she loves or not her husband and want an affair, if you tell me that that is the way that all the women think I really don't agree with that, I don't really think that this book could save any marriage or even any relation, having an affair is against all the laws, but many people do that (I said many not all) and I think that if one is having an affair he or she will not tell the New York Times, this things are secretes always or almost always.<br />This book has to many pages that doesn't say anything or what it says is out of range of any book, but why she has to returned to her husband? I thing that Isadora really needs help.	2003-10-15
I agree	I am definitely agree with Bookworm who made a review in April 28, 2000 that the book is to repetitive, but I will write some things that Bookworm didn't write.<br />Since the illness of Liz till she die, are about 60 pages, when you read that she has bone cancer you just know that she will die, D S could write all this lines in less than 20. Another thing is that when the biologic father of Jane ask Bernie for money and his attorney told him why he didn't adopt her, he must adopt her immediately after he paid Chandler why didn't he?<br />When the judge say to Bernie that Chandler has the right to see his daughter once a week, that is OK because he is her natural father, no matter if he was in jail or if he didn't see his daughter in 9 years, but when he kidnapped her in the first visit, he took her out of the country with a fake passport in a stolen car, he didn't see his parole officer in more than two weeks and the judge give him (Chandler) his child again that is really pathetic, if those are the laws in California, thanks God that I don't live there.<br />The way that Chandler die is really unbelievable. and with that the book has to be finish, I don't know why it continue.	2003-10-13
Agradable	Es un libro f&aacute;cil y r&aacute;pido de leer y le deja a uno un sabor agradable, tiene un par de bromas en el cuento pero no es un libro que hace re&iacute;r, sin embargo te mantiene interesado en la historia todo el tiempo.<br />El final es casi igual a la historia de la Riena de Saba por lo que al autor le falt&oacute; un poco de imaginci&oacute;n, pero fuera de eso es un bonito libro.	2003-10-11
Where is the justice?	Phoolan was a woman who didn't know how to write or read, but she described her life very well, I want to tell you the I started to read the story of Phoolan from a french writer and I couldn't read more than fifty pages, then a friend gave me this book and I didn't want to leave it (for my friend) so I started to read it, and I really couldn't leave it until I finish it.<br />This is a sad and unfair story but even if we want, we can't take the justice in our hands and kill and mutilate all the man that rape the women.<br />This is a well written book that keeps you interested in the story all the time and you want to be with Phoolan always. Is a pity that this is a real story, but maybe with this book the life of some women would change, if this happen, the life of Phoolan will be for a very good reason.	2003-10-09
A really heavy book	As you can see in this book, the story of Hollywood was the same since it started, if you are a woman and you want to be in the screen, you have to have sex with the directors (Dulcie) if you are a man you have to deceive them (Mark).<br />Apart of that, the book is really heavy to read because it repeat itself many times when you are reading the story of 1938, that makes the book a little boring. That doesn't mean that the book goes out of the main story but at least I don't like to read twice the same story in a book, no matter if it is written in two lines or in two pages.<br />The story has ups and downs, is not a bad book but you will take some time reading it, so if you see it at your parents house take it, and before you read it get prepare for a heavy book to read.	2003-10-09
Not the best of Elizabeth	The story of Ellie Duveen will keep you reading all the time, but the books goes out of the story so many times that has parts really boring, it has two mistakes that could be written in other way, for example if a man is a pervert, completely insane, dangerous, and the family doesn't have money to keep him at the mental hospital, the hospital just let him free even if he attacked one guard?<br />Take this book to your next flight and maybe you will enjoy it.	2003-10-06
Nothing special	As all the story books it has some stories really good but the majority of the stories are not good even if we are in 2003 and all the stories were written in the 1950's, I can't tell you that is a waste of time reading this book, but the end of almost all the stories are really bad, maybe you can read a story or two between books and you will like it more than I.<br />Some stories had a strong message, but this kind of literature definitely is not for me even if we are now entering in the world of robots, by the way, about robots were only three stories, the others were \\"out of this world\\".	2003-10-02
If she said so ...	I just don't believe what I read in this book, first of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 50 pages, all the stories around the main story are boring and boring, and she compares what would happened if Jack the Ripper were alive in these days, how would you know that? When you write a story that really happened you don't compare what would happened if that story would be in our days.<br />I wrote a book of the story of Cleopatra and I wrote my novel in the Antarctica, but I never made any comparison if Cleopatra were alive today, you just can't do that.<br />I put 2 stars to this book because I just can't put one star to a book.<br />But at the end you really think that Patricia Cornwell knows who was Jack the Ripper?	2003-09-29
Predictable	Although this is a good story, is predictable almost when you read half of it, and it has too many descriptions out of the main story, I think that in a small story like this one it doesn't matter if it is 10 pages shorter and you just tell the story.<br />I think that at least once in our life we had an experience like this, not so big and maybe we didn't put attention if that happened to us, but think about the miracles in your life.	2003-09-26
Interesting stories	As all the good stories books, this one has a strong message in each story that put you to think before you are going to do a &quot;bad&quot; think to anybody, because what you are doing to others it could reverse to you, good or bad things, these stories are to think about.	2003-09-26
Fast reading	This is a fast book to read, is not exactly a medical thriller until the last third of the book but it will keep you interested in the story, the way that Joanna and Deborah solve their problem at the end of the book was a little bit naive, but you have another end?<br />If this book could be real or not is not the problem, the problem is that I really know women that can't have children and they do anything to have them without thinking the consequences, and if a woman can have some money that she really needs maybe she will give some of her \\"eggs\\" with out thinking that maybe the doctor will do something to her body.	2003-09-25
Everybody can be a pilot?	If you read this book like a thriller you will be disappointed, some parts are thrilling but not even half of the book, this is not a bad story but is not the best of Follett, nevertheless is a book that will get you a good time. This book is a story of the WWII but you will not know to much about that war in this book, but maybe, just maybe you will know how to flight a plane.	2003-09-22
The perfect crime	Since the first page till the end, this book has the perfect crime, &quot;More know the devil for old than for devil&quot;, is the first book that I read that since the beginning is telling you part of the finish, that keeps you interested in the story all the time, and as I like from many writers, T.W. Simpson doesn't put Sam like a woman that doesn't know what to do and how to handle any particular situation, I like when the women can defend their selves alone or almost alone, and at the end you will see how to do a perfect crime... many times.<br />SIX STARS FOR THIS ONE	2003-09-18
Treasure Island? Robinson Crusoe? Gilligan's Island?	The story of this &quot;modern Crusoe&quot; is nice, and will keep you interested in the story and how they solve the problems with their bare hands in a lost island, in this book you will find two or three things that are really interesting and you will learn how the people change when they are in danger or they have to do something that they don't want, is not a thriller, but is a good reading.	2003-09-15
Two different books	Because I am the first reviewer, I will tell you about the plot of the book.<br />In this book are two different stories:<br />1) Elizabeth and Steve had a plane accident and they were the only survivors, she was perfect after the accident and he has a broken leg, after two days some people who lived in the jungle in Australia rescue them and adopt them so they live with them.<br />2) In England the husband of Elizabeth works in a medical laboratory and there is a virus who is killing everybody and nobody can do anything to stop the virus, that virus started in Australia.<br />The big problem of the book is that the stories are never connected, the part of Elizabeth is another story and it could be written in another book.	2003-09-12
Just a good book to read	This book is not the best of Michael Connelly but is a good read, but if you want you can skip the last three chapters and you will miss nothing, the part of McCaleb's investigation is much better than the trial, but this part is also good, if you are a Connelly reader don't expect to much of this book and with that in mind read it.	2003-09-11
... Story	... Sad story or nice story or hilarious story... I can't tell you that this is a nice story, is a real sad story with a perfect end, that end is why I gave this book the fifth star.<br />While you read the book you will laugh several times, but laughing on the problems of others is not so good, but I think that many women think like Shelia, since they remember they want to get married, and as Shelia say to her friends, when they are married they want to be single again, so here is Shelia's question: Do you really will change your married life for my single life?	2003-09-09
Four nanostars	Four nanostars which means three normal stars, at the beginning the book will keep you interested, but as you are reading it gets slower and slower, and as all of Crichton's books the end is to long, it could be shorter and a little bit better, another thing is that all the book could be real, but the end is just a fantasy, he could think better on how to end this book. Nevertheless Crichton is a very good writer but is very difficult to write always very good books.	2003-09-04
Just another book	This book is not bad at all, but it isn't good either, if you read it you will have a nice time, but at the end of it you will have nothing, is a good reading if you don't have another book to read, the story of the black investigator is simple and is not a page turner book, so maybe you won't finish it.	2003-09-01
Not exactly a thriller, but almost	This book definitely is not a thriller, but is a good story that will keep you reading, sometimes it goes out of the main story and the way that Phyl met Brad the first time is one in a million. This is a very easy book to read so you will read it very fast, and as many books, the end is like Cinderella but that doesn't mean that the book or the story aren't good.	2003-08-29
Quite good	I'd love reading this book, the story keeps you interested all the time, at first the plot of the book makes you think that is a monster on the mountain, but at the end when you see why he was a monster you will think if that could be possible.<br />It has two ro three things that you wouldn't do if you were MaryAnne Carpenter, but maybe that is part of the book to keep you interested in the story, apart of that is a very well written book.	2003-08-28
The worst pirates book	I can't put less than two stars to a book because I know what is to write a book, and just writing it it deserves two stars, but this is the worst book of pirates I ever read, beginning with this:<br />The book has 400 pages, and if you take all the pages that doesn't have to do anything with the main story you will have a book of 150 pages or less, the main story is boring and contradictory, and  the end is the worst end I ever read, sincerely skip this one.	2003-08-26
The last experience	I think this will be my last book of Sidney Sheldon, may be the book is good, but all of his books have the same style: the first part of the story you can't put the book down, in the middle he writes pages and pages of stories that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, and at the end he repeats two or three times everything to get to the end, when you are about 3/4 of the book you just don't know if you want to finish or just skip all the pages to the end of the book.<br />The story of the book is a well known story of Hollywood, if you are a woman and you want to have success there you have to have sex with the directors, if you are a man you have to deceive the director to have their attention.	2003-08-26
Just nothing	First of all, this book goes so many times out of the main story that is difficult to remember it, the main story could be written in 50 pages or less, you won't take anything of this book, maybe two or three things about the animals Down Under but that is all. The story doesn't have any sense since the first page till the last one.	2003-08-26
its is getting worst and worst	The first part of the book, the story of Tanya is excellent, is a page turner and you will not be able to put the book down, but when Tanya is gone the book is getting worst at each chapter and the writer begins to write and write things that doesn't have to do with the main story, you will also read some parts that medically are impossible (and I am not a medical doctor), but when a woman has an hysterectomy as young as 18, she can't get plastic surgery and she has to take many pills to feel good and she can't make a diet to be a model, NO WAY, as this are many things that can't be possible.	2003-08-22
I just had to read this book	I read the story of  Long John Silver (supposedly written by himself) written by Bjorn Larsson that is a wonderful story, but at the end of this book it says that if you want to read the last attack of Long John Silver you have to read Treasure Island because if it was written once he will not write it again, that's why I had to read this book.<br />This book has about 300 pages or so, but it goes out of the main story so many times that you don't remember the story, compared with the story of  Long John Silver this book has nothing to do.	2003-08-20
Wonderful	If you want to enjoy reading, to enjoy a book, to read a book the you don't want to end, read this one.<br />As always happened to me, I read first the second part of this book Lady Boss, so I knew part of the plot of the book that is written in Lady Boss, but the way Jackie writes and describes everything about Gino and Lucky is just wonderful, I was in love with lucky in Lady Boss, but with this one I almost marry her, excellent book.	2003-08-14
Predictable	This is a good book, but is predictable almost always, the plot of the book will keep you reading but you will know what will happen in the next page before you read it, including Rhyme's operation. If you already read The Bone Collector or The Coffin Dancer, you will know that Rhyme will deduct everything almost from nothing, and with that you can imagine what will happen next, these three book are alike in his deductions, so if you already read one, you almost read the three of them. This doesn't mean that I won't read another book of Jeffery Deaver, but he has to change something about his writing.	2003-08-09
Esto es realmente vivir la vida	Este libro trata de una mujer a la que todo le sale mal y no le da la menor importancia, ella decide vivir con lo que tenga y con lo que pueda sin hacer da&ntilde;o a nadie y sin importarle que le hagan da&ntilde;o, toma la vida como se le aparece y trata de arreglar lo que puede y lo que no, simplemente lo ignora pues no tpuede hacer otra cosa, el final de este libro es excelente. Parece una historia triste, a lo mejor lo es, pero uno se divierte un rato mientras lo lee y va viendo c&oacute;mo resuelve sus problemas.<br />Recomiendo leer este libro sin prisas, ya sea en la playa o en un viaje largo de avi&oacute;n.	2003-08-05
Not a penny worth	When I saw this book, I thought that Nick Hornby will tell us about his experiences at the stadium, for example:<br />The first time that I went to a stadium to see the San Diego Chargers (I live in Mexico but my brother lives there). My brother asked me if I want to go to the game and I told him that yes, so the next day he didn't offer me nothing for breakfast, I didn't comment anything because I thought that we will eat some hot dogs at the stadium, then I saw him to take some beers, sodas, meat and everything to do a barbecue so I asked him if we are going to a barbecue after the game, he just smiled.<br />When we get to the parking lot at the stadium I just didn't believe my eyes, everybody was having a barbecue I just started to laugh and laugh because here in Mexico you will never do that. (I don't remember who won that game nor the others games that I will tell you in this review).<br /><br />The second time I went to see the Chicago Bears with a friend, I knew that in the stadium they only sell two beers per person per time so in the line for the beers I told my friend:<br />\\"Buy two beers.\\"<br />\\"No, I don't like so much beer, I only want one.\\"<br />\\"I didn't asked you what do you like, I told you what to do!\\"<br />At the end of the second quarter I asked him for my beer, and he told me that he already drank HIS second beer.<br /><br />The third and last story is when I went to see the Houston Oilers at the Astrodome. Behind me was a group of ten or twelve persons, in that stadium were glasses that contain three beers, so they make a competition to see who drinks all the beer faster, so the first started and he drank almost all the beer but part of it went directly to his pants, everybody was laughing, so when the second started, the first make him laugh and happened almost the same as the first one, to make the story short, at the end, the person who won the competition was the one who has more wet his pants.<br /><br />Now, in this book the writer just wrote all the results of his favorite team of Soccer in England since 1968, that shows us one of two thinks:<br /><br />He has an excellent memory or he has a sports book to write them down, I think that nobody will check if those results are true or not, nobody cares even if you leave in London.<br /><br />If the book would say his stories at the stadium, it doesn't matter which sport is because you are not interested in the sport, you are interested in the people who goes to see that specific sport. If I went to a stadium about 10 times in my life (to see football) and I have this and others stories, I am sure that a person who goes to the stadium to each game of his favorite team must have many stories like this to write them, some of them funny and some sad, but that will keep you interested in the book.of Soccer in England since 1968, that shows us one of two thinks:     He has an excellent memory or he has a sports book to write them down, I think that nobody will check if those results are true or not, nobody cares even if you leave in London.

A good story	I can't tell you that this is an excellent book, but is a good book to learn something about how is the life in Latin America, are parts of the book that it doesn't have many sense, but is part of writing and making a good story, if you try to verify in all the books the parts that couldn't be true or the &quot;big mistakes&quot; made by the protagonists, you won't like any book. The story of the book is not a page turner but you will learn something while you read.	2003-08-05
Everybody has his own point of view	I read this book in less than 3 days, I gave the book to my wife and at least 3 friends and they enjoy the book the same as I, I don't know why some people are disappointed with this book, when I read their reviews I didn't wanted to post mine, but I really enjoy reading this book so I will recommend it to all of my friends.	2003-08-05
Everybody has to take care of security	This is an interesting book, nobody will believe it until it happens, here I have some questions: what's the minimum time to empty a Super bowl stadium? They have an emergency evacuation in every stadium? Does the people know where to run?<br />I am not saying that the only problem could be from the sky, remember the book &quot;The eleventh commandment&quot;.	2003-08-05
Good point of view	This is the story of a TV comedian who decide to be religious, he explains why he was convinced by the religion and start to act as the religion say, nevertheless, in the book he never asked his wife or children what they thought about his decision, maybe his children it doesn't matter (I am not agree), but his wife? I think here is a big mistake, because when you are not religious and you decide to be very religious, you can't take that decision alone if you are married.<br />In the book you will read some stories that happened to him and you will understand why he change his mind, I recommend this book because you will understand why people get more religious, or vice versa.	2003-08-02
Sad story	This is a sad story, of course all war stories are sad, but lose two lovers in almost no time must be very difficult, the book is a page turner, but I think that at the end of the book, when you really know the end, that end is written in to many pages, and that takes away some interest in the book.<br />The life of Paxton was sad since the beginning till she found her lover, but maybe that make her so strong and so open mind to do whatever she has to do, but losing lovers and friends is very difficult to everyone.<br />I was to young when this war was, but I remember that everybody said that the US didn't have to be there, with this book I can confirm that.	2003-07-31
Everybody see the world with different eyes	The story of LJS is &quot;great&quot; if you can say that word to a life who always was outside the law, of course for him he was doing right and he was making justice among the seven seas.<br />This story will show you how the pirates thought and how they work to make their dreams come true (if the have any dream as LJS said more than once).<br />Is a good book to read except the last two or three chapters, but is a book that worth every word it has.	2003-07-29
This book is a waste of time and money	If you really don't have anything else to read, read this one, nothing of what is written here can be true. The plot is the following (I will write it because this is the first review and is nothing written about this book).<br /><br />Parker who is a bank robber went to jail when he was betrayed by some friends. When he goes out he found those friends (of the mafia) and try to kill them. Super Parker goes for the mob himself because they owe him part of his last robbery.<br /><br />If you have one day at the beach without children, you can finish this book in one day.	2003-07-25
Who wrote this book a CIA agent?	I know that the CIA and the FBI are always fighting like brothers, but you have to give a break to the FBI, for example:<br />The Chief of Anti Terrorist department of the FBI knows that somewhere in the US is an african terrorist who escaped from jail in Africa, he (the FBI agent) knows that the terrorist is dangerous is armed and he knows that the FBI is chasing him, so the FBI agent saw a guy behind his car, he is alone and unarmed and say:<br />\\"Hold your hands, FBI agent\\". What do you thing that happened to the FBI agent?<br />After that, and knowing that the terrorist just killed an FBI agent, another FBI agent chase the terrorist alone, no back up, the terrorist enter to a chinese cafe and when go inside the FBI agent saw that the cafe is empty, so he asked a waitress: \\"Where is the restroom?\\" What do you thing that happened to this agent?<br />Now, the star of the book, Sarah Cahill, she worked for the FBI, then she worked for the Anti Terrorist Forces of the FBI, she know something don't you think? She went to Central Park with his 8 years old kid and while her kid play base ball with another unknown kid she started to read, then when she finished she didn't see her kid and after 10 minutes or so she saw that four or five kids are knock him and then, in New York, in Central Park came a man from nowhere, save her kid and since then both are lovers, when that man appear to save the boy I knew who he was.<br />At the end of the book, that is as worst as it can be the person who solve the case wasn't the FBI, was a police from the NYPD, please give some credit to the FBI.<br />Now two big lies:<br />First: If you want to track a telephone conversation from house to house you need at least 15 to 20 minutes, but if you want to track a call from a cellular phone with 30 seconds is enough.<br />Second: In the book is written that if you want to destroy the World Trade Center you need an atomic bomb DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?<br />Thinking better, if I were an FBI agent I will sue this book.<br />Now the story of the book, here you will see how work the cellular phone, all the terrorist acts to the US since 1970 secret or not, and all the TOP secrets of the FBI. I don't know why the US want such agency, but thanks God that this book was written before 2001, because if were written after, in the book the FBI Agency would be closed.I will sue this book.<br />Now the story of the book, here you will see how work the cellular phone, all the terrorist acts to the US since 1970 secret or not, and all the TOP secrets of the FBI.

&iquest;D&oacute;nde est&aacute; la justicia?	Para ser una persona que no sab&iacute;a leer y escribir narr&oacute; muy bien este libro, quiero decirles que empec&eacute; a leer la historia de Phoolan Devi escrita por una escritora francesa y no pude leer m&aacute;s de 60 p&aacute;ginas, cuando me dieron este libro lo empec&eacute; a leer por no dejar y efectivamente no lo pude dejar.<br />Es una historia triste y hasta cierto punto injusta, pero es verdad que no podemos tomar la justicia por nuestra cuenta y mutilar a las personas que se dedican a atacar a las mujeres, aunque a veces den ganas de hacerlo.<br />Es un libro bien escrito, que te mantiene en la historia todo el tiempo y realmente te hace estar del lado de Phoolan, es un l&aacute;stima que esta historia haya sido real, y peor a&uacute;n que sigan sucediebdio estas cosas en el mundo, pero estoy seguro que aunque Phoolan ya no est&eacute; viva, su historia har&aacute; algunos cambios a esa situaci&oacute;n.	2003-07-19
3 women, 3 generations, 3 stories... 3 stars	I can't tell you that this is a bad book, but I can tell you that this book is more for women that for men, the book will keep you reading almost all the time the three separate stories:<br />Grandma, is the best of all the stories, but at the end something is missing with her, her story is not complete, but the way she does everything for her family is like a fairy tail, but if she was happy doing that it was perfect.<br />Mother: She was a little bit selfish, but even if she has her own career, she care for her family until her husband doesn't care for her and she look for an FBI agent.<br />Daughter: Is the same story of her grandmother, the only problem is that her mother doesn't like that kind of life (that is the selfish part).	2003-07-15
What do you think about your doctor?	What do you think when you go to your doctor, that he will help you? That the only thing that he wants is your money? That he cares about you? The only problem with the medical thrillers is that you will think twice if you want to see a doctor or if you want to go to an hospital.<br />This thriller is good it will keep you reading and you will see the two types of doctors that exist, one who the only thing he wants is money, and the other that the only things he wants is to cure people, I think that this profession is the most difficult to live with, in one hand you need to live, but in the other is with the life of a person that are you dealing for.	2003-07-12
A great story of ancient Egypt	Like Abduction is not a medical thriller, so if you expect that you will be disappointed.<br />This book will take you to the ancient Egypt, and as all that kind of books you will not know what part of the story is true and what is fiction, nevertheless, the book will keep you reading and you will know some parts of Egypt and some things about the pyramids and the pharaohs, at the end is a little out of reality but is a good end because Erica doesn't promise anything to her boyfriend, and you will know that she doesn't love him to much.	2003-07-10
Don't read this one	At first the book is interesting and will keep you reading, but it is to technical in the explanation of the law for the paints, that is really boring, and at the end, is like you never read this book, you will have absolutely nothing, everybody did what he wants no matter if it was against the law, and everybody win, could be that possible?	2003-07-07
Just to kill time	The first part of this book is really good, the story of Audee Walthers will keep you reading and maybe you will learn something about Venus, the rest of the book is going down and down as you read, it doesn't have any punch to keep it reading, I can tell you that when you finish the story of Audee Walthers close the book and you will be very happy, if you decide to finish it don't expect to much from it.	2003-07-01
I don't know why I finished this book	First of all, this book has an introduction to each chapter that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, those introductions together are at least 100 pages. Everything that happens at the investigation is written at least three times, (when Michael Daley discovers it, when he tell his ex wife and at the trial), this takes off about 40 pages, and at the end, when one of the suspects kill his/herself and wrote a letter and with that letter everybody knows who was the killer, and after that nobody could do nothing to catch him, is really pathetic.	2003-06-30
One turn after another	This book makes so many turns that you will never imagine how is going to end, when you think everything is solved it gets another turn and believe me, you wouldn't be able to close the book until the end.<br />The must important part of the book is that shows that the police department are men, and as all men of the world, they have their own problems and secrets, their problem is that the life of a policeman is public and everybody knows what happen to them.<br />The story of Harry and how he work to save his career is almost like superman, but this is a very good reading, if you have this book, just read it.	2003-06-26
Exactly the same story	This book is exactly the same story as American Star written by Jackie Collins, that doesn't mean that this book is better or vice versa, the only thing is that if you already read American Star, don't waste your time with this one.<br />This book is the typical love story, at first Crystal  and Spencer meet, then the problems begin and keep going on until God says: from now on everything will be fine, and everything is fine. Nevertheless, the book will keep you reading page after page and willing to know what will happen in the next page.<br />The story of Crystal in Hollywood is the typical one, the problem is that many people like that kind of life, sincerely I don't like it and I think that is a pity that men deal with women like personal things.	2003-06-21
You think that the power can change you?	Excellent reading, in this book you will see how a super intelligent kid have many more problems that a normal kid, everybody thinks that if a kid is very intelligent he or she has everything to be happy, but that is true?<br />I have to tell you that this book has some parts that could been written better, but those things doesn't take any of the five stars that I gave.<br />The book will keep you changing page after page, and at the end you will be able to answer my question: You think that the power can change you?	2003-06-19
Business man	This is a good book to read anywhere, you will have a good time reading it and may be you wouldn't be able to put the book down, the story of Katy Wade is a little bit out of reality, it happens everything to her and she still is an optimist, in the other hand if that is possible is a very good skill.<br />The story of Luke is completely real, he returned to the family for her, not for the money that he didn't needed and of course with a grandma like Justine, nobody will return to her.<br />Is a little repetitive the words just like a Gilchrist, but is part of the book. At the end you will expect somehow that end, maybe with any modification in your mind, but you will imagine that end since three quarters of the book.	2003-06-13
A good book for entertainment	This book is good read, nevertheless, the story is completely out of reality and the end of the book is a little bit better than bad, I have many questions of how a student of medicine could do a better work that an FBI or CIA agent, so I recommend this book just for entertainment, if you read this book and try to check what part of the book could be real and what couldn't, you won't like it because none of the book could be real, starting with the assassination of the Secretary of Defense (this is in the first chapter, so I am not telling you any part of the story of the book.)	2003-06-11
It 's a difficult review	This book is the first one that is difficult to me to review it, is a book that will keep you reading, but is not a real good book, is a book that doesn't goes out of the story but sometimes is a little bit boring, is a book that it really has three separate stories that at the end the last one join to the first story, it has a love story that it isn't a love story but it ends like Cinderella, I really don't know what to say, I can't tell you that this book is a waste of time but I can't recommend to you as a good book, but you will have to read it to understand me.<br />I am not a lawyer so I don't know if that end is possible or not. But even if you are a lawyer you have to take care of the sues you make, your work could be against you.	2003-06-09
Let's start from the beginning	Let's start from the beginning, first, if you read this book and you expect a medical thriller like: Coma, Outbreak, Fever, Chromosome 6 or Toxin among others, you will be disappointed and you won't like this book, if you see this book as a Sci Fi book as the books of Jules Verne is an incredible book.<br />The story of Atlantis, the lost city, is good, and the end is just as Dr. Cook know how to end his books, there is no other end to this book, but also at the end Dr. Cook gives us a very good message: \\"No matter who are the good or the bad guys, the people who has the power, technology, etc, are the winners, in one way or another.\\" You just can't say I don't like you and just go, that is the very truth.	2003-06-04
Who has  the power?	Amazing story. Even if it was written 7 years ago, we still have the same question, in the companies who has the power? The answer is not the men nor the women, the power is in the position of the company whether is a man or a woman who is the president, and when that president want something he or she will do whatever he/she has to do to get it, it doesn't matter if is his secretary or her personal adviser, it doesn't matter if nobody want to do this or that thing, if the boss say something they will do it.<br />The story of the book is different because is a man who make charges to a woman of sexual harassment, it is difficult to believe, but it can be real. The book will keep you reading all the time, but has a little mistake, you know exactly what happened in the first chapter and you know who is guilty, may be it will be more interesting if you didn't know exactly what happened until the end of the book.	2003-06-02
Scary some of them, good definitely not	This book has 13 stories, I think Robert R. McCammon wrote 13 stories because is a bad luck number to many people, so we start with 13 stories. Of these 13 stories the stories that I would recommend are:<br />Yellowjacket Summer: This is a good story but it has a really bad end, you won't take anything of this story.<br />Make Up: : This is a good story, better than Yellowjacket Summer but it also has a really bad end, you won't take anything of this story.<br />Doom City: Is an interesting story and it has a really good end, as a matter of fact is the best end of all the stories, but it has no message at all.<br />Nightcrawlers: This is the best story of all, it has a good end and a message for all those people who were in a war.<br />Yellachille's Cage: Is a nice story and it has a very strong message, this and The Red House have the best messages of all the stories.<br />Night Call's the Green Falcon: This is the nicest story of all, this story could you tell to your children before they sleep (you will have to change one or two things to do that but is really nice)<br />The Red House: is almost as good as Yellachille's Cage.<br />Blue World: This story is good and it has a message for all the priests and two or three messages for all the readers, the book goes out of the main story many times, but is worth it to read it.<br />So here we have 6 good stories with good ends and two good stories with bad ends out of 13, I think you can choose another book before this one.	2003-05-30
Amazing story	What would you do if you are going to be free after seven years of prison, and you are involved at a jail outbreak?<br />The story is amazing and will keep you reading all the time that you maybe will end this book the same day you start it, maybe the chapter 1 is a little bit boring, but that is all, the rest of the book is great.<br />Here I have a question, how could you believe that the justice say that you have to go to the war and defend your country with your life, and when you are at home and kill someone in self defense you go to jail?<br />I definitely recommend this book.	2003-05-26
It could be true?	I don't know if one love could be alive for more that nine years if no one see each other, keeping that apart, the story is almost good, I think is better Secret Thunder that is the first part of this book, but sincerely you don't need to read the first part to read and understand this book, but it helps.<br />The story of Alexander and Nicolette is quite simple and whether  is true or not, is the story of almost every book, it does not have something really interesting but it will keep you reading if you feel like reading a book, don't expect to much of it.	2003-05-26
Wildest Hearts, wild marriage	In this book you will see that your reputation means everything to the people, Annie asked Oliver to marry her for her convenience, and everybody thought that the wedding was for Oliver's convenience.<br />The story of Annie and Oliver is quite different but when they meet each other they know that each one was made for the other, is a very nice and easy reading, but I have to say that the story of Daniel is not so good.	2003-05-22
It really doesn`t worth it	When you start the book the story of Santiago is cute, when he decide to go for his treasure is a good story, but when he start to speak with the dessert, the wind and the Sun among other things, it is really boring and boring, this book could be great if the writer kept writing real things, things that will really help other people.	2003-05-16
My first SIX star love story	This is an excellent story, of course I am agree that is not exactly a love story and it has some mistakes between the present of Thorn and the past of Roseleen and vice versa, but the trips between the past and the present, the way that Thorn saw the modern things are very exciting, you will laugh two or three times, but the best part of the book is the end, when you read the end, you will see that this book could it be possible.<br />Why is not a love story?<br />Well of course is a love story, but you are not interested in that story, you are interested in the past and the present of the book, but at the end of the book, when almost everything get fixed, you will be interested in how this love story ends, and it is worth it each word of the book	2003-05-15
Nice reading	This story show us how a woman can give a man strength to be alive, Malcolm wanted to be dead until he saw Ariella, you also find out that if you want something you really have to fight for it, because if you don't do anything for yourself nobody will, and another interesting point is that maybe for you something is perfect, but for anyone else won't be so perfect.<br />The story of the book is nice, not amazing, not incredible, just nice, is not a page turner but you can relax and read it, for example (as I did) on two or three rainy days, when you just must be at home.	2003-05-14
Incredible imagination	Excellent story, at first when Monk found Miriam and she told him that she is innocent, but she can't tell anything because nobody will believe her and because is better if she die that telling the true, I thought that the book doesn`t worth it, but I kept reading because the book keeps you interested in the story, so I said: \\"OK, I am sure that at the end I will regret to finish the book but I will.\\"<br />When you get to the end of the book, you will see that Miriam was right, she will be better dead that telling everybody the truth of what she saw in Lucius house, I don`t know if this story could happen to a woman, but I wish not.	2003-05-10
A remembering story	This is a nice and easy story that you will read in one or two days and you will remember your student days, how you wanted to be with a girl/boy and he or she didn't want to be with you. Not to mention the parents of each one telling you that he or she is not good for you.<br />The story won't give you anything but your memories, is a nice story to read even if you are angry or sad.	2003-05-06
From boring to emotionally	I have to confess that the first part of the book, the story of Kate and her lover, her problems at work, at home were boring, but when you finish that part of the book is getting better and better until the end. The way she talk with Jules and the way she rescue her won't let you put the book down.	2003-05-05
3 Friends, 3 Doctors, 3 Stories, 3 Stars	At the beginning of the book, when Sondra, Ruth and Mickey met, and began to study medicine, tried to solve their problems, their family and became best friends is a very good story, after that, when each one finished and went each one to work to another part of the world, the only good story is Sondra's, the story of Mickey is good but not as Sondra's story, and the story of the selfish Ruth is the worst, another thing is that they are always best friends and they saw each other only once in more than fourteen years, is that possible?	2003-05-05
Nice story, strong message	In this book you will see how a woman who doesn't like any kind of bets, she bets not once but three times with Bryght Malloren and she lost the three times, so here we can learn that if you don't like to do something just don't do it.<br />This book will keep you reading the story of super heroine Portia St. Claire who climbs all kind of walls and super hero Bryght Malloren who is always there to save her.<br />This love story is kind of different from others, if I tell you why I will tell you the main story (the three bets that she lost) and I think that this is a nice book to read.<br />In the other hand of the love story, you can see how gambling could make rich people poor.	2003-04-28
It all depends...	Maybe this book is only for newly weds, new lovers or desperate people who don't want to lose his or her lover, husband or wife, in those cases could be a good book.<br />Of course the romantic part of the book will be great for ALL the women, is their dream to had a romantic dinner, trip or whatever you like to be romantic, but when you know your partner in bed, you know what he or she likes is very different from each couple to other, in my case none of what is written in that part of the book works, I can't tell that is not true that many persons like that, but not all of them, and I think that nobody will do exactly what the book say in one way or another, you can have some tips to help your relation, but that is all, don't think that if you read the book you will have a happy marriage or anything like that.<br />One important thing that is not written here is that before you go to bed with your wife, girlfriend or lover, shave your face, no matter if is in the morning or at night or if you have to shave twice a day, they will love that.	2003-04-24
Round and  round	Definitely is a good book that will keep you reading and thinking if you really want to go to a doctor, for me it has two little mistakes but that doesn't mean that the book doesn't deserve five stars.<br />The first is that the book keeps a circle that doesn't goes out and you will know what will happen next (you will know who is the bad guy at the time that he comes to the book, why Abbey Dolan didn't know?)<br />The second is that you really doesn't know what will happen to some characters at the end of the book.<br />The book will never goes out of the story and you will learn one or two thinks of medicine.<br />If you tell me that this book was written by Dr. Robin Cook I will believe it, because the end is exactly as he writes, and the story of all kind of doctors that the only thing they want is money no matter what.	2003-04-23
Not a medical thriller	This is a good book to read, is a thriller, but not a medical thriller, the book will keep you reading all the time, but whether it could be true or not the end is not a good one, of course you just can't kill everybody (animals and humans) at the end but I consider that the book must have another end.	2003-04-21
Nothing special	I can't tell you that this is a bad book, but of course it isn't a good one, the story of a stewardess who is better that a mafia person is not very real, the book will keep you reading sometimes, the way she deceive Ordell doesn't make sense, no one makes that kind of money and he just lose it so easy.	2003-04-21
Just skip the epilogue	This is the story of a child who perceives the problem of his parents an that keep him down, is a different kind of story because of course that could be real, but in the other hand, as it says in the book &quot;Marriage is not an eternal romance in a path full of roses.&quot; Anyone who is married knows that this is true, the problem is that when your children just see the problems, is when they have serious problems.<br />In the other hand, who wasn't in love with his/her teacher in second grade?<br />The book will keep you reading and it won't be out of the story at any time. but don't read the epilogue, don't worth it.	2003-04-10
Extremely well written	This book is an excellent story, first of all, when you read the prologue you really hate Paige, Honey and of course you don't know anything about Kat, she wasn't there. But when you start the book and you see how the three doctors where treated when they were young you will start to understand the present.<br />In the middle of the book you will hate every doctor except these three woman, and of course you will love the end of the story.<br />Is an easy and fast book to read, it won't take you many days to finish it because you will not want to put down the book.	2003-04-07
The typical love story	This book is the typical love story, at first Nick and Lauren meet, then the problems begin and keep going on until God says: from now on everything will be fine, and everything is fine. Nevertheless, the book will keep you reading page after page and willing to know what will happen in the next page.<br />In this book you will learn two or three things, for example what can a rich man do with your life if you are not strong enough to get out of his life (Lauren with her husband).<br />Almost everything written in this love story could be real, is a very good book.	2003-04-05
This is Robin Cook	This is the kind of books that I like of Dr. Cook, of course I am not a doctor so I don't understand many things about medicine, but this book is definitely a medical thrillers, and as all of his books you will think twice before you go to a doctor or a hospital.<br />The story of the hospital that want to save money instead of save patients is not out of reality, in other words I can believe that these things could happened in a small town or a place that have not too many hospitals.<br />It has one or two mistakes with their daughter, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't be real.	2003-04-02
Is only one Linda Howard in this world?	I just don't believe that I read a two star book from Linda. After I read Mr. Perfect, After the Night and Dream Man, and I saw this book in the book store I almost had a fight with another costumer for the last one (just kidding), and when I started to read it I just couldn't believe what I was reading, if this book were written by other person I just would't finish it, but I said: give it a try and then I was in the middle of the book so I finished it.<br />The main story of the book is hard enough to remember, this book goes out of story so many times, for example: it has a full chapter when Daisy went to make her hair and make up, so what with that, who cares! Another is when her new pet destroyed her new house so what! And many more.<br />When I saw this book I thought that I would laugh a lot and have a nice time, so please Linda, make another book to take me this bad flavor of my mouth.	2003-03-31
Nice and easy book	The only thing that you will have of this book is a nice time, of course is one of the things that you want while reading a book, the story of Luke and Faithe is like a fairy tale, (you don't know what part could be real or not), but with this story you can just relax and read.<br />The main story will keep you reading but is not exactly a page turner book, so I recommend this book for your vacations or in a long flight.	2003-03-25
A strange book	When I began the book (with the problem of Marianne) it obviously had five stars, when you finish that part you won't understand why it was written in so many pages and it really doesn't have to do anything with the book, so the book has now four stars, in the middle of the book, when you see why it was written the [beginning], the book has only three stars ..., and that keeps during all the judgment of the doctor (I won't tell you which one because I will tell you the story), but when the judgment is almost over, when you almost finish the book you will see that this is definitely a five stars book, And when you read the last chapter you will see that you will recommend this book to your friends.	2003-03-22
Just different	First of all let me tell you that I am in love with Cleopatra, so much love that I wrote a novel of her good things (I didn't publish it , is just for my friends and my proud), that doesn't mean that she didn't something wrong, but at the end of the book I made a question: \\"This question is for the women because they know more exactly the answer: Women, you think that could be physically possible no matter the job of a woman, that a woman could be with 30 man in one night only?<br />Well, in this book were written only the bad things about her and that I didn't like it, nevertheless is a book that I couldn't put down, definitely is a well written book.<br />You will learn something of the life of Ramses and the life of Cleopatra, and learning while you read is something very important.<br />The way Anne Rice describes the early years of the 1900, is not very real, but that it really doesn't matter when you are reading a good book.<br />At the end of the book could be two things:<br />1) You just end the book and that's it.<br />2) You will wait for the sequel (sincerely I won't because it will say things of Cleopatra that I don't like.)	2003-03-15
I don't believe I finish this book	If you think that in this book you will read something interesting about the ancient Egypt, you are completely wrong, the main story of the book is the diary of Amelia Peabody, but I don't think that if someone writes a diary will write what think another person, you can't do that, you just don't know what others think.<br />Basically the book is the story of an assassin who killed his wife ten years or so before this story, it really is boring and boring.	2003-03-13
All the investigation for nothing	First of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 250 pages or less, the other 250 or so are things that has nothing to do with the book, for example the fight between Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard and the way they were training for the fight, I can give some more examples.<br />The book has really nothing, no matter if it was real, and at the end the person who did the murder, well nobody does nothing to catch him and they knew who was.<br />And in the other hand, all the investigation was for nothing, at the end of the book you will see that even if there were no investigation at all they will find who was the murderer.	2003-03-13
She is a really good writer	This book is 3/4 a turn pager, the end of the book is so descriptive that you almost will not want to read it, at the end of the book, as all of her books is a fairy tale, even if you know who was the bad guy in the middle of the book is a nice reading, you will not regret if you read this one.<br />What I really like of her books, is that she shows us how a woman can start with nothing and live in a world of power with or without men.	2003-03-11
You will laugh and laugh	You will laugh while reading this book almost all the time, the jokes that it has are very good and you will have to laugh.<br />The story of the murder is a little bit disappointing because at the end of the book the \\"bad guy\\" just gives up and go to Stephanie's house to try to kill her, but if you want to have a real good time two or three evenings (it depends on how fast you read) read this one.	2003-03-04
Excellent finish	As all the books that I have read from Jeffery Deaver, I found a big mistake in the book, but in this book were two big mistakes, that mistakes are enough to take out a star. The mistakes that I found were:<br /><br />1)  The plane that exploded with Edward (Percey's husband) on board had had half million dollars in human organs (that is on the first chapter, so I am not telling you anything about the story), has a bomb and everybody knew it after the accident and the hospital gives a second chance to Percey to transport more human organs three days after, I really think that the hospital should try another airline with out bombs don't you?<br /><br />2) In another scene crime Lincoln Rhyme found some sand from (I won't tell you because you will know the story) in a car of an FBI agent that was kidnapped, if you go to a beach outside NY and you return to kidnap someone, at least you change your clothes don't you?<br /><br />This two mistakes take down a star, nevertheless, the end of the book is one of the best I ever read, that end gives the book five stars again.	2003-03-04
The last one	Definitely the last book of Katherine Neville, first of all let me tell you that if you decide to read this book, the story that is written in the beginning of every part of the years 1800, just skip it, don't worth it your time.<br />The second point that is at the very beginning of the book is that when you are going to find a new job, please don't tell me that your future boss will call to your actual job to ask about you, is obvious that your actual boos won't say anything good about you.<br />The third point is that the book has nothing, two people are trying to rob a bank using the computers and some hackers, but definitely Katherine didn't know how to write it or how to explain it, I put two stars because my mind didn't let me put just one.	2003-03-02
Wrong, wrong, wrong	This book is wrong in almost everything it says, for example:<br />In the trial of Mike and Lindy the jury SUPPOSE that Lindy lie when she said that she wanted to marry with Mike, but Nina proof that Mike made perjury in middle of the process, and all the jury were against Lindy because she is a liar.<br />The jury waste three days to take a decision, and then happened a \\"little\\" problem and when the judge make another jury they have their decision in three hours.<br />The worst of all the book, Paul, the boyfriend of Nina, he attacks her on the judgment, when the judgment ends, Paul investigates what happened with that \\"little\\" problem in the jury and he knows that if he does that Nina will lose everything she has, why he did that?<br />At the end of the book, what happened to Mike and Lindy is pathetic, but that Nina still loves Paul even if he left her is more than pathetic.	2003-02-20
All these kind of books are alike	All this kind of books are equal, the writer writes what happened to him and think that if everybody do what he is doing will be a better world. The book is definitely boring and it has nothing of the Toltec story, if you skip the introduction and you go directly to the four agreements and only read that, will be fine. Don't waste your time with the epilogue either.	2003-02-20
Enough for four stars	The story of Elvis Cole is a page turner, and I have to confess that is the first book that I read that the guy who did everything good and has everything (girlfriend, friend and a good job) at the beginning of the book, he lost almost everything at the end, he didn't have any affair (and he could) and lost his girlfriend, save his friend and he lost him too, and when he decide to have an affair that girl die (but he didn't have a girlfriend anymore), so at the end he lost everything.<br />Nevertheless this story is excellent.<br />The story of Joe Pike is a little bit long and boring, of course you have to read it to know how he is.<br />The part that I didn't understand was how became very good friends the father of Karen and Joe.	2003-02-17
The chinese plot	With this book you will understand that not all the things are as they look, the chinese police were investigating a murder of a girl who worked in an american factory, they found that the factory was completely out of the chinese law, they found that the general manager was almost a killer, the factory which was closed because of their problems with the workers didn't have anything to do with this murder, read this book you will enjoy it.	2003-02-17
The perfect love story	This book is the perfect love story, Harry and Alessandra, both having their own problems, family, money, etc. but when they met because her husband was from the mafia and Harry was an FBI agent their story begins.<br />The story of the mafia is almost relative, all the time you want to know what would happen to Harry and Alessandra, it doesn't matter if they are in danger or what is happening to the other people of the book. If you read this book as a perfect love story you will like it, if you read the book as a police book, you will not like it because are many things in the investigation that you don't know where they come from.	2003-02-13
Poor book, poor writer, poor Ellen	Well at first you will think that is an excellent book, I can't tell you why I finished the book it really doesn't worth it, nevertheless the finish of the book is excellent but you can imagine the end when you are at half of the book. The main story could be written in half of the pages of the book and when you reach the end you just can't believe that the police and all the people who lived with Adam didn't know what he did.<br />Poor Ellen and all the women that have to live like her.	2003-02-11
Not the best of Cook	I like Robin Cook because he makes medical thrillers not police or mafia stories, in this book you will read everything but medical things, and at the end Marissa discovers why so many women can't have children and you don`t know why or how.<br />Every writer must know what to write, and Dr. Cook must write medical thrillers, not other kind of books.	2003-02-10
What do you think when you are gambling  in Vegas?	This is an excellent book it keeps you reading page after page and makes you think two or three things about the security systems in Las Vegas.<br />If you think that security of any Las Vegas hotel is always with the good guys you will have to read this book to convince yourself.<br />The book has three stories in one, the private investigator, the security manager and a gifted thief who knows everything of the casinos.<br />The book begins with a robbery of half million dollars and Cassie robs 2.5 million, of course she thinks that is money from the casino until she discover that the mafia is after that money, but not only the mafia...<br />Thinking better, this book deserves SIX STARS.	2003-02-06
Erotic?	The first half of the book is a page turner and you want to know what would be in the next page, but as many writers, in the second half the only thing they want is to fill pages with letters that doesn't have to do anything with the real story.<br />Neal knew all the time what happened to his father and how, he didn't have to do every thing he did just for revenge, and the epilogue doesn't say anything, you just can skip it and you won`t miss anything.<br />..	2003-02-04
A different story	The story of the book is very different from almost all the books that I have read and I have my own questions of the veracity of the facts when they happened 6 years before, but as I always say you read to have fun and you can't expect that everything written in a book is real.<br />The story of any person in jail is depressing, and I think that is more depressing if that person was innocent no matter what other people think (outside of jail of course).<br />The book is an easy book to read and is perfect for the beach or any vacations, because is not a turn pager but it keeps you reading, so if you have anything else to do you can stop reading any time.	2003-02-01
I strongly recommend this six star book	THIS BOOK DESERVES SIX STARS.<br />Excellent reading, this is because you will never know what part fo the story is true or false, is a completely different books of KGB and CIA spies, if this book is true I can understand why there are no secrets in the world including the &quot;secrets&quot; of the former USSR.<br />This book is amazing in the story, the secret dead of Stalin, but is not an easy book to read and maybe is a little bit long in some descriptions, I strongly recommend this book if you really want to know how think the spies in both ways, personally and professionally.	2003-01-28
Excellent Finish	This is an interesting book, it will take you a while to read it because is not an easy book, but it will keep you reading, the way it explains the basic things of what is a Black Hole in space and other scientific things is  as easy as it can be.<br />Of course this is a Sci Fi book, but the way it ends maybe will make you think that could be real, why not? At first they think that the sphere is from outer space, but when they explain that if Leonardo Da Vinci would see a TV he would think of magic, he would never know how it works, that makes you think.<br />This is one book that will make think things that you thought you were sure of them.	2003-01-23
Simply nothing	Definitely is not the best book, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget the story.<br />In the middle of the book, if not before, you know that Alex is the bad guy, why can't see this Jo if she is one of the bests pilots of the USAF?<br />I can give other examples but I will tell you the story of this book (that I don't recommend at all.)<br />The worst part of the book is that you will not take anything if you read it, no lessons, no messages, no nothing.	2003-01-19
Do the writers know the future?	I know that is not so good to compare books among writers, but I will make an exception this time, first let me tell you of Icon, written by Frederick Forsyth in 1996, this book is a spy book of a conspiracy to make again the Soviet Union in 1999, we know now that it was not true.<br />The second book was written in 1998, The Magic Circle by Katherine Neville, in this book (the spanish version El Circulo Magico) in the page 413 (where is a map of Afghanistan) says:<br />\\"You can suppose that at the beginning of the new millennium will be something that will make the earth scramble, an this thing could have his origins in Afghanistan\\".<br />In the next page says:<br />\\"The new millennium should start on the year 2001.\\"<br />Everybody knows what happened on september 11, 2001.<br />The third book is this one, it was written in 1999 and is about a bacteriological war with anthrax in New York, what happened in America after september 11?<br />Now, about this book:<br />This book is really a three or four stars book, it depends on your humor while you are reading, some pages are a turnover book and some don't, many times it goes out of the story and definitely the boyfriend of Laurie Montgomery doesn't have to do in this book, but I gave five stars to this book because everything was real before it happen.	2003-01-15
Do you believe in empathy?	This is the second book of Linda Howard that I read, it was better the other book (Mr. Perfect) but this one is not bad at all, you will laugh when you read it (it has some internal jokes) and you will have a good time reading it.<br />At the end of the book I have my questions, if Marlie was so angry with Dane, how he convinced to go to bed? The epilogue is [not good], but you will laugh when you will read it.<br />This book is not a page turner but it will keep you interested in the story.	2003-01-11
Read it, try it, the book worth it	As all the books of &quot;search the personal excellence&quot; you have to try it to see if it's true, of course not everybody could try this and other books of this kind because all the people are different.<br />The advantage of this book among the others of the same theme is that you can read this book in 20 minutes or less, is easy to read because it doesn't have examples on how could you solve this or that problem, and it has a strong message in every chapter, if you just try to do one or two of these messages you can be sure that your life could change.	2003-01-08
A different story	At least this is a different story, and in this book you will see that the people who has money and power think that they could do anything, but they have to take care of the people who work for them, specially in the job of Cat Shannon.<br />The book will keep you interested almost in all pages, the last to chapters are to long for the things Forsyth describes in them, but so far you have to finish the book, in one chapter says that Cat swam several miles to do his exercises, but at the end of the book this is a contradiction, you will see when you read the epilogue.<br />As the books of Forsyth  that I like, you will never know if this story is true or false.	2003-01-08
Do you believe in doctors?	Of course are to many writers that write medical thrillers, but to know how the hospitals work and how the human body works the person who writes medical thrillers must be a doctor.<br />As all of his books, when you finish this one you will not want to know nothing about doctors but I really recommend this book, is an easy book to read and you can finish it in 2 or 3 days.<br />It is amazing (if is true) how some doctors attack other doctors like a company attack another company, I know that everybody wants to live better each day, but the doctors have to know that in their fight the only loser are the patients, in other words WE are the losers.	2003-01-04
Nice book... nice reading	As almost all of her books, Barbara takes you to the past and makes you to live there, this is a good book but it has some things that I think are not true, for example it says that Cleopatra was white as milk and in every book of Cleopatra that I have read says that Cleopatra was almost brown, and some other things that in some books are different.<br />The 2 love stories of Selene are different and I don't know if it could be as easy to forget as Andreas did, but is a book and you read to have fun.<br />You will be inside the story all the time and you will love Selene for what she does for the people.	2003-01-03
A different story	First of all let me tell you how I read this book, it was december 29 and I went shopping with my wife, I saw a book store and bought this book, I started reading at 10 o'clock and finished that night, even if I don't celebrate X'mas I like very much this book, because when you do something every year you just can't skip it one year just because.<br />The book is very easy to read and it has a great message of friendship at the end, is a very nice story.	2003-01-02
Just boring	I read this book because everybody told me that the movie was excellent, I didn't saw the movie because I like to read the book instead of the movie, but this book was completely disappointing to me, is a hard book to read and all the story (when you can find it) is really boring.	2003-01-02
Nice reading, not so nice story	This is an easy book to read, I can't tell you that is a page turner or an exciting thriller, but it keeps you reading and interested in the story.<br />The story of the killer is more or less good, but the reason of Sparacino to chase Kay is not so good because you really doesn't know anything about Sparacino.<br />Now, the biggest mistake, Mark, if he is an agent, he can't tell anybody what he is, including his lover, I am wrong?	2002-12-24
Who is really the boss?	First of all let me tell you that this book is not an easy reading. It has to many characters and to many stories, to be exact it has six stories. At first all of them separately but in the middle of the book they will be as one big story. Of course the main story the story of Lucky and Lennie is the must important but you are really interested in all the stories at the same time. When you end a chapter of one story you want to skip the next chapter to see what happened in that specific story, but when you start to read about the other story you forget about the first one and you will want to know what happened to this one.<br />The end of the book is not so good, but the book still keeps 5 stars	2002-12-23
Good stories	Is the first book of stories that I really like, there is one finish that I didn't like at all, the story of the painter. Is also the first time that I can select what finish I like from a story, let me tell you that if I can change the end of some books I will.<br />All the stories are easy to read and have their own message (except the story of the painter, or maybe I didn't understood it.)	2002-12-18
Is Japan really invading us?	Definitely this book is a page turner, and if it's true that the japanese are buying all the important things of America the government must do something, but I don't believe that in Japan are no poor people, I know that the Japanese get married with their job and company, but it is a very poor country, remember the last earthquake there? they ask for help because they don't have enough money.<br />Another interesting point of Japan is that they have the higher number of suicide between ages 12 to 25 because of the competition at school or work. Japan is not the easiest place to live, but, we have to take care of what they are buying not only in America but in the world, because they don't invent anything, they copy everything, but they copy it well and they make it better than the original.<br />The end of the book is not so good because John Connor who knows the japanese very well assume what happened and why, he doesn't really know why ...	2002-12-14
A vacation book	This is an easy book to read, but definitely is not a thriller, this book is ideal for your vacation because you can stop reading whenever you have another thing to do no matter at what part of the book you are, nevertheless is a nice story that when you will take the book again you will enjoy reading and again you can stop reading if you have another thing to do.<br />The end of the book is like a fairy tale but is a nice ending.	2002-12-09
Excellent medical thriller	One of the best books of Robin Cook. It will keep you reading all the time. It also will show you that a family must stand together no matter what and that you must trust your wife or husband. And the end is not out of the reality, at first you will think that that end is not possible, but when you read the explanation of why it can be you will believe it.	2002-12-05
The last book, the worst book	I think this will be the last book of the Fallen Angels Series, and is the worst of them, if you compare this book with the others, you will understand me that I only wanted to finish it because I wanted to know the end of the story, if this were the first book of the series that I read, I would not finish it.	2002-12-02
Amazing robs	This is an excellent story, the first part of the book when tracy goes to jail and when she get out and takes revenge for her mother, the second part is a little bit repetitive with her robs because one and another, and another were almost the same, except the last one, that was an amazing one.	2002-12-02
Nothing about Congo	If you think that when you read this book you will know something about Congo you are wrong, this book explains electronics, volcanoes, weather, etc, about Congo you will read about 20 pages, the descriptions of all the procedures are really boring and if you are not on that field you will not understand, maybe it was a real story, may be not, I really think not.	2002-11-23
I don`t know what to say	I really don't know what to say, with this is the third book of Frederick Forsyth that I don't like at all...When you read this book you will know the story of The Phantom of the Opera, but if you only read the preface the book will be perfect, the rest of the book is what happened to the phantom when he escaped from France, that includes two or three chapters that don't have to do anything in the book, take my advance, don't waste your time with this book.	2002-11-21
I found a big mistake in this book	Every time I read a book of Robin Cook I hate all kinds of doctors, you don't know what can be true in the field of investigation. But this book has a big mistake, this mistake is that VJ only has 11 years and he made a laboratory by himself, sell drugs, and have a big team working for him and nobody knew it, that can be true only if Dr. Cook change VJ's age to 20 years, then everything could be possible and then this book will be a 5 stars book.<br />Taking that away with the explanation of the ADN formulas that I didn't understood, this is an easy book to read it will keep you interested in the story.	2002-11-19
When a book is a six stars book?	You can rate a book up to 6 stars when:<br />1) No matter where you are: a stadium, at work, at the movies, etc. and the only thing that is in your head is the book that you are reading at that moment.<br />2) Everything that is written in the book is or could be real.<br />3)  In the book you always read the story, it never goes out with a second story that has nothing to do with the main story.<br />4)  Everybody could read the book no matter the age.<br />5)  It has some jokes that distracts you from the story.<br />6)  You will recommend the book to everyone.<br />This book has all of these points.	2002-11-18
Definitely not a true book	This book has to many things that are completely wrong, for example: in this book there is a fight between a hacker ( who was in jail) and a cracker who wants to kill people like a computer's game, the hacker sent an email with a virus to control the hard disk of the cracker and to know where he is, you think that a cracker will not have an antivirus in his computer?<br />When the cracker found the hacker, all he wanted to do is kill him, he has two opportunities and he didn't kill him because...<br />It was also another woman who wanted the programs of the cracker, and when were the three of them she didn't kill the hacker why?...<br />I put this book 2 stars because just writing a book deserve 2 stars.<br />If you want to read a book of the net that could be real and amazing, read: Don't Talk to Strangers by Bethany Campbell	2002-11-14
Who are the good guys?	This book is a page turner, but I have a question: who are the good guys? The answer as it says in the book: &quot;The difference between patriot and the rebel it depends on who is in charge of the people&quot;.<br />The interesting of this book is that at the end everybody gets what he or she (almost) deserves.<br />The book has everything, romance, religion, action, etc. if you have a long flight maybe you will read all the book on one sitting.	2002-11-13
Nothing to learn of this book	You won't take anything out of this book, that is a fact, how to know if you are in the mood to read it? It is very simple, if you read 2 chapters and you didn't laugh at least 5 times don't read it because the jokes of the book will be as in those chapters, for example: in the state of Virginia, home of the FBI there is a governor who doesn't even see his nose. The governor wants to control the speed of the cars in an island that have four or five big cars and the rest of the people uses golf cars.<br />If this is not a joke for you, just don't read the book.	2002-11-11
Let's get real	The beginning of the book is very good, you think that you will never put the book down, the fight of Victoria with her father, the way she found her sister the first time, the way she help married woman and the way she save her sister, all that part of the book was well written and you will never put the book down while you read this.<br />BUT, the love story of Victoria with Zach is really very boring, it takes you out of the story so many times that you will want to leave the book, but the end of the book is very good...don't leave the book.<br />What happened in the love story?...when a writer writes FOUR explicit sex scenes with the same couple (Victoria and Zach), for me, that is a signal that the writer doesn't have anything else to write and he or she wants to write many pages in the book...	2002-11-01
A very good book	First of all, this book is very easy to read, that gives it a star, the point number two is that you will laugh a lot while you read, that is another star, it has a very nice love story (exactly two love stories but the one that counts is jaine's) that is the star number three, it is a real thriller, a police book, a book that show you what is the meaning of friendship, that is the star number four, and the last star is for the finish of the book, you will never think of that finish until you read the last chapter.	2002-10-26
To many coincidences	As all of these books this is an incredible love story, but it has to many coincidences, all the time that Kit wanted to do something wrong was Lucien there to help her, and one time she saved his life even when at that time she hated him a lot.<br />About how Kit found her sister, how she contacted her, I can't tell you that it is not true because I have some twin friends and they say that they can communicate with his/her twin sister/brother when one is in trouble, but is really hard to believe.	2002-10-23
Just another book	All the stories has their own message, but I can't tell you that is a good reading, if you have another book to read take it and read it, read this one between books (one or two stories) and then another book and may be you will be interested in the stories, as always in these kind of books, you just can skip the last story, is very long and it says almost nothing.	2002-10-21
Please take care of your kids on the internet	This book is incredible and amazing, you won't stop reading until the end, and it has a very strong message at the end of the book, the message is: no matter what happen inside the internet, some people will solve their problems, some people don't, but always will be a new naive that will think that to him nothing will happen on the net<br />...<br />The book is explicit on the internet chat problems, I recommend this book for every teenager, it should be a must in every high school of the world.	2002-10-17
So far so good	This book has an interesting story including the heritage of the family, of course a diamond, but it has some characters that doesn't have to be there. At the end of the book the only thing he has is the diamond, he has no family, no lover, etc.<br />The question is: Will you change your actual family for your heritage?	2002-10-15
A six stars book	I started to read this book one Saturday at 10:00 A.M. went to a party at 6:00 P.M. and finished the book on sunday at 10:00 P.M., this is the second 6 stars book that I ever read, it keeps you turning page after page and it has some things that when you read it you will not understand why or how does it happened, but at the end of the book you will understand everything, it also has one or two things taken from sleight of hand like one of the police officers dead, I didn't tell you who because I will tell you part of the story.<br />Don't skip this book.	2002-10-14
This book is getting worst from one story to the other	This book has 4 different stories, in all of them appear Spy McCready as a super hero, the book will keep you interested in the stories but is not exactly what I expected from Forsyth.<br />The first story has 4 stars.<br />The second story has 5 stars.<br />The third story has 3 stars.<br />Don't waste your time with the fourth one.	2002-10-12
Love boat chapter 5865	If you saw on TV The Love Boat, you already read this book no matter what chapter you saw, but if you still want to read this book let me tell you that the first 150 pages (more or less) are really boring, I really don't know why I finished the book, but after those pages is going better and better, but it still is a chapter of The Love Boat.	2002-10-07
A book for the beach	This book is easy to read and you can read it in one or two days, but it goes out of the story so many times, or I have to say so many chapters? You will laugh many times while reading the book but other times you will be bored of the way she explain other things that are out of the main story.<br />I can't tell you that this book is a waste of time but is not the best that I have read, If you have one or two days in the beach maybe you can read it there.	2002-10-03
Excellent!	This book is Excellent for reading anywhere and anytime, reading this book you will learn (more or less) how think a pharmaceutical company to improve or create new medicine, you will also see how react the people that doesn't like this kind of companies that sincerely we all need them and they have to work with animals whether we like it or not.<br />We also see how doctors work, some for the cure of the people and some for the cure of their own bank account.<br />The life of Celia and Andrew was terrific, I want to live that way with my wife and I am not talking about the money, I am talking about the way that each one support the other one. Here is the only part that doesn't belong to the story, the affair of Celia, I don't know why it was written, is mentioned only once and is written in 15 or 20 lines, again, that part of the book doesn't belong to the story.	2002-10-02
A real sad story	This book is a real sad story, it keeps you reading almost all the time, is not exactly a thriller but is very sad, reading this book you will see how live the people in the Vatican and how they feel.<br />The story of Isabel and Luca is sad since the beginning of the book, also is the story of Piers Hallet and is only written once, but the childhood of Stephanie was awful.<br />I won't comment anything of how Luca and Isabel met because I will tell you part of the book, but it was terrible, if you are not in the mood of \\"crying\\" while you read, don't read this book.	2002-09-27
A good story	I read this book before September 11 2001, I thought that it couldn't be true, now I am not sure of that, I think that it could be real that some people are planning to have control of the world, may be not the way is written in this book but in these days anything is possible. If the manuscript that is at the end of the book was written in the sixteenth century, the person who wrote it could be anything, but he has an excellent mind.<br />The book will not let you leave it until you finish it.	2002-09-27
Interesting reading	This book will explain why a man or a woman can be spiritually impure since Adam and Eve, and how he or we can be pure again with the help of natural water, but I mean natural water that can not be processed by a man with any kind of materials (like pipes or things like that), of course this is only in the [jewish] religion.<br />This book is easy to read which means a lot when you read any book of any religion.	2002-09-24
Nice and easy reading	This book is wonderful, it keeps you in the story all the time, if you are in a bad mood, take this book, read it and it will help you to be happy, the story changes from the \\"good\\" guys to the \\"bad\\" guys and then the \\"bad\\" guys are again the \\"good\\" guys , but you will never expect that wonderful ending, I recommend this book to read it anywhere, it won't take you too long to finish it even if you are not an avid reader.	2002-09-23
The second part of the book is better	Well, first of all I have to tell you that I don't have anything against Jeffrey Archer, I read from him the eleventh commandment (an excellent book) I didn't read Kane & Abel but I saw the picture, I didn't like that picture because I am not agree to send away your son because you hate his father in law, of course there is a Spanish saying \\"Never say you will never drink of this water\\", so I hope not to do what Mr. Kane did in that book, other interesting book is The Fourth Estate, but is the same story of Kane & Abel but instead of an hotel owner and a bank owner they are two newspaper owners, but they don't send away their family because of their fight.<br />Now, this book, half of it is the story of Kane & Abel, here I have a question: Mr. Archer doesn't have another stories to write that he has to write the same story in three books?<br />The last part of The Prodigal Daughter, when her father and father in law, both died, is really good, how Richard and Jessie (Florentyna) help each other to have their own goals, and other thinks like that, that you can learn how to be a good husband or wife.<br />This book has his own message, but is a waste of time reading the first part of the book if you know the story of Kane & Abel.	2002-09-23
Medieval time	The first half of the book is interesting and keeps you reading and learning of the quantum theory and the middle age, how they travel to the past and saw the actual images what they had studied, and it is incredible if you compare the middle age with our days, believe me, it is almost the same, they have a castle and 15 minutes later the castle was down, we have the twin towers and 15 minutes later we haven't.<br />The second part of the book is a little bit to long, they are fighting and when they were almost lost it happened a miracle and they won the fight, how many miracles can be in a book? maybe it would be better if they were in the middle age for 18 hours instead of 37, just a point of view.	2002-09-19
A book to think about it.	I can't tell you this book is out of reality, but I can't tell you that it is true, the story whether is real or not, (I refer to the history of the religion), is really amazing and it keeps you reading and turning page after page, I think that what is written in the scrolls is a little bit long, it could be shorter but is part of the book.<br />Who knows how many things that an archaeologist found keeps it just for the pleasure to have it?	2002-09-17
A good police book	This book is amazing in every message it gives, first of all Alex Cross is a good father, play with his children all the time he can, he never gives up at work and has respect for his friends and family.<br />Kate is a person who wanted to live no matter what, at first you think that she is a little bit smug but when you know how was her childhood you will understand why.<br />The story of the kidnapping of the girls, the investigation and even the horror that suffers the girls don't skip anything or takes it from the hand, everything that happened in the book is perfectly explained, sincerely much better than Hannibal.	2002-09-12
Not my style	Well well, this book is very easy to read and you can finish it in three or four days, but is not a good book. Is the story of three friends that work in broadway at first and then in Hollywood, the story of Anne is the better one, is not boring and will keep you reading, but here I have a question, how much time could wait a young woman for his man when he disappeared and then she knew that he returned and he didn't wanted to see her? I think that is a big mistake of the book.<br />The story of Jennifer is a sad one and is interesting to read but not as Anne story.<br />The story of Neely is the worst, when she is at the hospital is boring, but what she made to her best friend Anne, well let me tell you I prefer enemies that a friend like Neely.<br />I can't tell that the book is worthless or a waist of time, but is not a good book. if you have another book to read will be better	2002-09-09
To tell the true, this book is awful	This book is awful, but not for the descriptions of horror that has, for everything else, in the first part of the book, when Clarice is in action killing Evelda and his gang is a real thriller, you think that you will never put down the book, but when the book goes to Italy is boring and boring and so it keeps.<br />The less is written in the book is the life of Hannibal, you just know that his sister was eaten by some kind of cannibals in 1940 when their parents where killed in an invasion, but you don't know how he went to jail, how he escaped and why he has an expensive delight.<br />All the chapters have an introduction to it that has nothing to do with the story of the book, this introduction is at least half page of the chapter, if you skip all the introductions you will have a book of 60 or 70 pages less , and here can I tell you that are 2 or 3 chapters that doesn't belong to the book at all, for example when Margot and Barney went to the gym.<br />In all the story all the persons are the bad guys, except for Clarice, but Hannibal drug her, so at the end of the book only can win the bad guys, no matter what is your point of view.	2002-09-04
Why?	The story of this book is amazing, even if the story is true, it has parts that was invented by the writer, it has to many coincidences that definitely can't be real, but this parts make you keep reading all the time and wondering what will be on the next page.<br />The way that all the bad guys died is like an american movie, the worst they did in life, the worst they died, but that is part of the novel, you will never know if this part (the dead of the bad guys) is true.<br />There were two things that I didn't like, and of course you will never know if was true or not:<br />1) The husband of Felicity tells her that he love her and he will never had another affair, and at the first opportunity he decides to &quot;save&quot; his girlfriend and put in danger his wife's life, I said &quot;save&quot; because he knew (when you read the book you will understand) that his girlfriend and he will be dead after Dieter find his wife.<br />2) This point is why I put just 4 stars to this book, WHY? when a writer has an excellent book, an excellent thriller, an excellent everything, has to write the last chapter that does not has to do anything with the rest of book and that takes the smile from your face when you finish the book?	2002-08-31
A little bit disappointed	At the beginning is an interesting book, but in the middle of it it goes out of the story so many times that is a little boring, and at the end, when Colin talk to Leyla you will know everything he is going to say to her (because Leyla deducted before) and Leyla get impressed at the conversation.<br />Many things of the book are taken out of the hand (I can't write them right here because I will tell you the end of the story) so the story gets a good end.<br />On the other hand, the story is a good one because all the members of the family, except one, want her own good by keeping a secret that will hurt Leyla, at least is what they think.<br />I put three stars to the book because is not what I expected of Barbara, but I recommend to read it you will have a good time.	2002-08-27
Nice love story	This is a nice super heroes story that since the beginning of the book you will not leave it, but in the middle is a little bit boring and it has a nice end. I really recommend this book for relax and have a good time, the story of Jennifer is amazing and it can be true, whether your parents loves you or don't it is really very difficult to leave them for ever, on the other hand, the way that Royce fought his last battle is really more than a love story, and Jennifer's aunt, well every family has one.	2002-08-24
I don't believe it	I don't know how much of this book was written by Mr. Puzo and how much by Carol Gino, but definitely was not the style of Mr. Puzo, the book tells us the story of the Borgia family, but consider that family as a mafia family like Omerta or the Last Don, I really don't think so, if you read it as as history book may be you will like it (if is true what is written in the book, because it is impossible to know what a person thinks, you will understand this if you read the book), but is not a thriller, it won't invite you to read it unless you want to know the end of the story.<br />At the end of the book, is just that, but of course if it is a true story and that is his end you can't do anything.	2002-08-19
Not the best of Baldacci	This is an interesting book and is worth to read it, but many parts of the book are unreal, or at least is very difficult to believe, for example, at the end of the book the FBI agent knew everything and didn't do anything to solve the case until the end of the book. John Fisk hated his brother and he really didn't know why, and other things that if I write them here you will know the story before you read it.<br />On the other hand the book will keep you reading almost all the time but is not the best of Baldacci.	2002-08-15
Better than other two books	Maybe was because I get used to the writer style or because this book is more explicit, but I liked more this book than the other two, it still has many descriptions out of the story and things that happen only in Alexander's mind, how does anyone know what he was thinking at any time?<br />At the end of the three books you will understand that the way that Alexander conquered Asia and the way he treated the people was amazing and why all the people wanted to be behind him.	2002-08-15
Super hero	As all of her books this is a nice love story that has ups and downs, Michael is a super hero for her because she save her life in the waterloo war, of course she did that for love, you will see that when you read the book.<br />As all the super heroes stories it has his parts that couldn't be real, but you will enjoy reading this book.	2002-08-13
When a man gets fun, maybe a woman doesn't	Many people go to Las Vegas or Atlantic city or any place like that to see topless women in a show, bar, etc. but they, or maybe we, never think what does this ladies think of their job, of course I think that the 10% of these ladies do their job because they like it and the other 90 because they have to.<br />In this book you see how these ladies think and how nobody help them because everything is in name of the customers.<br />In the book you can also see the political corruption and the power that a person of the government can use just to justify himself.<br />The book is well written and keeps you reading all the time, it never goes out of the story and the less you read is sex, you will not need much time to finish it.	2002-08-01
Excellent thriller	This book has everything, is easy to read, it has suspense, is an excellent thriller, a good beginning and a very good end, it doesn't have ugly descriptions and it has no sex at all, believe it or not, is a book for a kid 13 or older.	2002-07-29
A repetitive  book of spies	At first is a very good book, but is has to many things that are useless, for example the 2 letters that wrote Philby to the General Secretary of the former USSR (if you read the book you simply can jump these letters.)<br />Another example is that the russian had to receive 9 mails to make a bomb in England from the former USSR, and in the nine mails the book writes the same stories how the mail get inside England and how is he dressed etc. (the same story nine times.)<br />At the end the book just come down with the last persecution that is also repetitive at least three times and the very end of the book is really disappointing.	2002-07-25
Not new Ideas	This leadership ideas are not new, I have a leadership course about 20 years ago with the book principles, the thing is that you have to believe them to put them in practice and not always you can do that.<br />As all the theories in paper this is very feasible, but to work with them is difficult for some people and easy for another, it is worth to try them at least one time.	2002-07-20
A cute story	This is a very easy book to read, if you can read it in an airplane you will enjoy your flight and your book, the story of a private investigator and his girlfriend solving a very peculiar case (her first case) is really cute.	2002-07-16
A different spies story	This book is a book of english spies in the early 1800 in France, but is different because the book tells us the personal problems of the spies (of course including a love story) instead of how they do their work or who they are spying, as a matter of fact their work is taken as a second story of the book, it is interesting knowing how a spy do one thing for his country when he really wants to do another thing.<br />Is a nice and easy story that will relax you while you read.	2002-07-15
To many comparisons for a real story	You can't tell is a great story when the story is real, here the writer tells us a real story and he writes things to compare the reality of that story with other stories, if you are writing a real story you don't have to compare it with anything, just tell the story and that's it.<br />In the other hand your will read many times that it was a sunny day, then a rainy day, the a storm day, you just get tired of reading the same in all the chapters.<br />In the main story you will learn that when happened a human tragedy, this tragedy is because were made several errors, not just one, and that was what happened to this crew.<br />For ME, the last chapter is the epilogue and the epilogue doesn't have to be written.	2002-07-08
A story from England	As many books, the main story of the book (when you can find it) is very good, but it has to many stories that are out of the story and that make a heavy book to read.<br />The main story has inside another story and with both stories (that at the end of the book both of them has the same finish) you will read about how was the life in England in 1714 and how began the stock exchange in that country.	2002-07-03
The same old story	The problem with this book now, is that it was written in 1996 and tells us a story from Russia that will happen in 1999-2000, now we know that that was not true.<br />Taking that apart, is the same books of spies, CIA, ex KGB, police, Kremlin, etc. It does not have new stories about espionage but is an easy book to read.<br />The end of the book is almost obvious and not so good, but that doesn't mean that is a bad end or book.	2002-06-28
Nothing to say	Definitely this is not my type of book, it has 230 pages and if you take off all the woods descriptions, castle descriptions etc. you will find a book of 50 pages or less. The main story, The queen of Sheba, is the less you read and parts of the story definitely are not true at all, of course I was not there to confirm what is true and what is false.	2002-06-22
The safety of airplanes	With this book you will learn some things about airplanes and TV networks, is a good book but I don't recommend to read it in a flight, just kidding, the writer keeps you reading all the time except when he describes the preparation for the people for the TV show and the epilogue, but that is a short chapter, is a good reading.	2002-06-20
Could it be real?	This book is really heavy to read, it has to many characters and to many places, the advantage is that many of them are killed in the same chapter so you don't have to follow everybody's story, but is a good one, it keeps you reading, the only thing that I don't know is if it could be real that a spy form USSR and a spy from USA could work together, is a heavy and a nice reading.	2002-06-18
Something is missing	Of course Barbara Wood is an excellent writer, at least for me, but in this book something was missing at the end of it, all the book was perfect, it keeps you reading, but when you finish, is just like that, you finished the book and you don't know what happened with the other people of the book, what happened with Judd? or Sarah? or Adam? or the last expedition to find her?<br />As in all of her books, with this one you will learn about Australia.	2002-06-10
Not the best, but a good one	At first is a good book, it keeps you reading until the american doctor found the killer of his father 30 years ago, then the book is to long and repetitive with the investigation of the police of each crime (the interpol, the french and english police and of course Mr. Mcvey from LA).<br />More or less at the middle of the book you will know why the people was murdered by the german people, and you will have to read it until you finish just to know exactly how was their plan of the future world.<br />Nevertheless of the story, the boring part that is long and repetitive, the love story that is on the book, the end of it is amazing	2002-06-01
Not easy to read	This book is heavier to read than the book number one Alexander : Child of a Dream, but at least you read about the public life of Alexander and how he conquered Asia, it still has to many descriptions out of the story like the book number 1, and some parts you just don't know if were true or not.	2002-05-25
Excellent	Excellent book, excellent beginning and super excellent finish.<br />Since the start of the book you get into the story, you travel from the first to the last days of the previous century and the story invites you to keep reading. When you read the sad story of Rachel you will say, \\"OK, another unattendent child\\", but when you read how she made her adult life to take revenge, you wont be able to leave the book. Maybe it has to much sex, but is a very good reading.	2002-05-21
Change at work to change your life	This book you can read it in one night, is easy to read and has a very good message, the part of the book that could be a fable is that everybody in the office will do everything to change and work better, when they are used to do absolutely nothing for the customers, could be that possible?<br />I thing we can try to do what is written in the book and change at work for our own good	2002-05-17
Good start, bad end	The first three parts of this book it can be considered a thriller, these parts inviting you to keep reading the book, this three parts can have 5 stars.<br />In the last part of the book (Sue) the story gets repetitive with the things that really happened in the story (changing the false things with the true things), the writer just change two or three things of the story and you will read the same things that are written in the first part, this is boring and make you thing that the book is not a good one.<br />You have to read the last part of the book to understand everyhing of the first three parts.	2002-05-17
A good story; bad writing	The story of Alexander is an amazing one, but in this book is boring because Valerio puts too many descriptions out of the story, I have the three books but I will read the other two between books to keep me in the mood to read Alexander. I will read them because I want to know more of his life.	2002-05-13
It is really top secret?	I put this book 2 star because I never put less than 2 stars in a book, that is because I wrote two books (I gave them to my friends, I didn't publish them) and I know what is to write a book.<br />Gordon Thomas is trying to tell us the most top secrets of the Mossad, I don't know if the Mossad, same as the CIA, MI5 or MI6 will let him do that (because all of them are involved), but if you like spies stories, read \\"Triple\\" (Ken Follet) or \\"The Fist of God\\" (Frederick Forsyth), in these books are telling all the Mossad secrets (same as in this book) with more enthusiasm and before anyone says that \\"is a secret, nobody will know it till you read this book.\\" So I really don't know how much of this book is secret and how much is public.<br />The book at first is interesting and keep you reading, but when you get to \\"the secret\\" part that is in other books is really boring, maybe because I already know the story, but since the half of the book I just read it to finish it.	2002-05-10
The power of spies	An excellent book of spies and tyranny of the gulf war, here Forsyth wrote as he knows and he keeps you reading all the time, I think that everything in this book could be real, nothing is exaggerated as in other books.	2002-05-09
An unreal story	It is not the best action book, but it keeps you reading, in the last chapter the description of the hospital, gardens, beach are too long but you will have to read it to know the finish.<br />The story is unreal almost all the time, is not like toxin that it could be real.	2002-05-06
Fight for your ideas	It is a story to relax and read, is not the best of Ken Follet but is not a bad story, with this book you will learn how some people want their freedom at any price and some people just want to be or do what other people say, no matter if it is a man or a woman.	2002-05-06
A love story	This book is a love story, nevertheless is a great love story and you can also learn something of oil painting and the feeling of the artist.<br />You get inside the book from the first page and even you could know who is the bad guy of the book before the story reveal it is a great read, it has action, love and suspense, you will get a great time reading this book.	2002-05-02
An excellent novel	In this book you see how the police are investigating a woman's dead and they thought she was murderer by his profession (prostitution) because everybody wanted her for himself only, in their investigation they saw that she was murdered by other reason, they have to start again with the investigation.	2002-04-30
A five story book	This book has five stories, each of one has his own reality and his own fable, some of the fables are out of this world but you will learn something of the book, the best story is the last one &quot;Whispering Wind&quot;, and the fable of the story is obviously out of this world.<br />Forsyth know how to write and every story keeps you reading from the first page to the last one.	2002-04-29
So far, so good	Of course this story could be real, the main story is interesting but some clues are taken from the hand. in the firsts chapters you read how is the woods out of the house about 3 times and that keeps you boring. It has to many characters and you have to put attention to each one so you can follow the story, nevertheless not all the characters are important.	2002-04-29
I just can't believe it	Unbelievable, but same as Greg (who is the other who wrote a review, and he read it in the same month), I found this book in a corner of my father's in law house, I read it and it was a wonderful reading, it was printed in 1974 and is a very good book, if you see it at your parents house just read it, you will enjoy it.	2002-04-24
The ancient Egypt	If this story is truth I have my questions, but even if is true, the book doesn't invite you to keep reading and the less you read is about Tutankhamen.<br />In the other hand you will learn some things about the ancient Egypt, but read it with a lot of patience.	2002-04-24
Un buen libro sobre espias	Es un libro interesante sobre los espias en la segunda guerra mundial, agradable y rapido de leer, todo el tiempo esta en el tema y rara vez se sale del tema con descripciones de bosques y casas, siempre esta en suspenso la historia hasta el final.<br />El final esta un poco fuera de la realidad pero eso no le quita puntos al libro.	2002-04-19
Is not her style.	This is not the best novel of Barbara, the story is interesting and may be could be real, I am not a doctor but if this story could be real we have to learn a lot more of the human body.<br />In general I like more The Virgins of Paradise, Green City in the Sun or Sacred Ground is more her writing style.	2002-04-16
This is a six stars book	I dind't gave this book 6 stars because this software has only five, since the beginning till the end, the book keeps you reading all the time. Is the best book I ever read. The book keeps you in the story all the time and is interesting in every word.	2002-04-16
It is not a thriller	This book is not a thriller but is a good book to read although is not the best work from John Grisham, but it has a mistake, when you are about half the book you can suppose who has the money, but you don't know why. Is a nice reading.	2002-04-11
It is a true story, but something is missing.	The first part of the book is very interesting, how two people get arrested in Iran an the company owner (Ross Perot) make the dream team to take them out of jail, but when they are out and they trying to escape it gets boring and boring, you can read it but don't expect much of it.	2002-04-09
Is not my type of book	This book tries to show you the human rights of the poor people in London while they resolve the mystery of a crime, you will never know who is the killer until the last page, not because the book is good, because it could be anyone of the book, the writer never tells you anything about the real killer.<br />At the end of the book, nobody does nothing about the human rights or anything else.	2002-03-19
Just relax and read	The story of the book is a good one, but the book is not an easy reading book, the way that the movie maker takes out of jail a prisoner to do his last job is a little bit out of reality if you see that is a maximum security prison combined with a psychological prison, it is not the best book, but you can read it in a flight or at the pool while resting.	2002-03-16
An easy book to read	In this book you can see how all the spies agencies of all the world know almost everything of each other, sometimes they want to work together and sometimes they have to work together, but many times they have to work alone.<br />The book keeps you reading all the time but the end is not so good.	2002-03-14
This title is the correct one The WINNER	The first part of the book is interesting, how a man who can move the lottery numbers to win as he wants convince a poor young woman with a child to win. She was on a murder scene and ask Jackson to change her name and he agrees if she leaves the country and never comes back.<br />To the second part I have many questions: why she returned to the US? Where does Jackson knew how to be more expert than a CIA agent? If Jackson was a person who kill anyone just for his convenience, why he didn't kill her when she returned?	2002-03-09
Not the best book of Grisham	This was a strange reading, at first very interesting with the life of three lawyer in jail and then when the CIA director decides to have a new president who wants more money for the army, but when the book explains the debate of the candidates and the trips for their campaign, is really boring, you just don't know if you want to read it till the end or just leave the book and start a new one.	2002-03-02
Be careful with a bad  partner	The story of this book is how a lawyer steal 90 million dollars from his firm, goes to Brazil to live but he can not use his millions because he could be caught, he has a girlfriend in Brazil who is helping him with his plan to have a trial, be a free man and spend his money with his girlfriend. When you reach the end of the book, you will say \\"it has to be that way\\" but in the middle of the book, you will never expect that end.	2002-03-01
Just delicious	I can describe this book with a single word DELICIOUS. You learn about the past and present of Egypt and you can see that there is not a big difference. A wonderful book to read.	2002-02-20
This is not Barbara's style	This book is not the style of Barbara, it doesn't compare the past with the present, it is a detectives story but is an easy reading book.	2002-02-20
A small but true strory	This book is a real story, people doesn't want to change and in this changing world we must change, or at least try to change.	2002-02-20
It is not the best book	The main story of the book is interesting and keeps you reading (when you can find it) all the time but it has to many explanations of the streets, houses, how  the people is dressed in each party, gardens etc. that makes boring a big part of the story.	2002-02-19
Good book bad epilogue	It is an excellent book, here you can see how does the Mafia works, how does the FBI works to fight the Mafia and how could be corrupted the police by the Mafia, the end before the epilogue is very good, you could never imagine that end, but I took off one star just for the epilogue, is the worst epilogue I ever read, if you read this book, just DON'T read the epilogue.	2002-02-15
A police story in Greece	It is a very good police story, but the facts that happened with the greek things and the story of the doctor that found that thing has nothing to do with the story of the book or the revolution of Greece	2002-02-12
A very good book and a better end	The story of the book is amazing, the people doesn't judge a person, judges a human race, and that you can see at the end of the book, is one of the best ends I ever read.	2002-02-09
An  interesting story of criminal psicology	I don't know how I do this but I always read the second part before the first, every body says that this book is better than The Angel of Darkness (of the same writer), I read first the Angel of Darkness and I loved that book better than this one, I am not saying that this book is not good, it is an easy reading book that keeps you interested all the time, my point is that I think that the first book between these two that you read will be better than the other one.	2002-01-29
Under the sun of Kenya	If you want to know the amazing story of Kenya, you must read this book the only problem I found is that the last 50 pages could be written in 15, but the story keeps you reading all the time.	2002-01-21
Who work with the law, the FBI or the former KGB?	This story is a little bit out of reality, but it keeps you interested in the book and you can compare the FBI with the former KGB as they work almost in the same manner.	2002-01-14
A story of the people who came to America in world war 2	This is not an easy reading book, is interesting in some parts and very boring in others, some part of the story could be real and some parts nobody will believe it, I think that in general is a heavy book, to read it you will have to have patient, I don't recommend this book for a plane or places that you want to read to be entertained with something like waiting rooms, etc.	2002-01-11
Jesus at 2030	I think that this book is the story of Jesus, I don't know why Colleen has written again this story 2030 years later, I didn't learn anything at all everything I just knew it.	2002-01-11
The end is not so good	On one hand, the story keeps you reading with interest on the story. On the other, is a story that can not be true at all, I want to see that the president's son is kidnapped in another country and nobody in America does nothing because they don't want to make an international problem, not telling that the son's bodyguards didn't have any guns.<br />At the end of the book, the bad guy in Washington could be anybody, Frederic never gives us a clue of him, and in the book he is never bad or do anything suspicious I didn't like this end.	2002-01-10
A hard reading	It is an interesting book inside, it shows you how the medicine goes for the money instead of going for the cure of people, but is not an easy reading, it was hard for me to finish the book.	2002-01-10
To know the first transatlantic flight	This book tells you or let you know how were the firsts trips to Europe by plane so you can compare them with our days, the book is really easy to read and have some internal good jokes, maybe I will keep away 2 or 3 sex scenes but in general is a good book.	2002-01-10
Amazing truth	Maybe this book need a little more punch in the story, but it takes 5 stars from me because everything is absolutely true and maybe all of us are used to see the homeless people in the streets and do nothing about them, I'm sure we can not do much, but a little bit from each of us could help a lot of people, I strongly recommend this book to change your point of view of this kind of people.	2002-01-10
An easy story to read	The story keeps you reading all the time except when the lawyers are talking how they will attack the enemy, that's a little boring, but in general it is a good reading story.	2002-01-04
Excelente novela de gangsters	Es una novela en la cual la mafia parece un negocio de lo m&aacute;s normal y legal, la intriga del libro es muy buena y te mantiene interesado en cada una de las p&aacute;ginas, aunque se supone que los mafiosos se quieren salir de la ilegalidad, la mafia siempre ser&aacute; la mafia.	2002-01-04
You can't stop reading	Since I started to read this book I just couldn't, stop doing it, is an amazing suspense story from the first page till the last page, and the way that Montana fights against the bad guys is not out of reality at all, meanwhile you learn a little bit of autism boys.	2002-01-04
It could be real	The worst part of this book is that it could be real, never let your children at the internet alone, and you have to take care of what are you saying on the net.	2002-01-03
Igual que Kane y Abel	Si no han leido el libro de Kane y Abel (del mismo autor) el libro esta muy bueno, pero si ya conocen la historia, se repite en este libro.	2002-01-03
Sad and contradictory	It is a very sad and contradictory book, for example Garp doesn't let the drivers go fast in his living address for the safety of his kids, but when he is coming home, before he arrives turns off the car lights and keeps driving killing one of his children, this is safe? let's ask to his son.<br />The writer writes and writes until everybody is dead some by the age and some by an accident.	2001-12-20
An african story	This is a story of an African family who is divided in selling or not their land, meanwhile a satellite expert is watching illegal hunters at this area, it keeps you reading at all times and you learn a lot of Africa and their illegal hunters, how they live, think and work.	2001-12-03
A relaxing reading	It is a really easy reading book, the story, secrets and dreams of a 7 years old farmer kid keeps you entertained at all times, I will recommend this book for a trip or when you don't have a hurry to finish it, just relax and read.	2001-12-01
Is just Barbara Wood	Reading this story was amazing, combining the present with different past eras, and viewing how the people make the same things no matter the era that is living and always go to the same place to look for their past.<br />When you are reading the book you see how she (Barbara Wood) studied the geographic land, the custom of the tribes, the way people get dressed in the past, etc.<br />Barbara involves in this story love, hate, family and going from hate to love again, including finding a lost parent. I read it in 3 days, it was really wonderful.	2001-11-27
Para pasar el rato	Es un libro que combina el pasado con el presente, pero no esta a la altura de Barbara Wood por ejemplo que escribe de manera similar, deja muchas cosas a la casualidad o a la suerte, esta mejor (no por mucho el ocho de la misma autora)	2001-11-27
Just another book	The really good thing about this book is the end, the rest of the book it really doesn't have any sense, but to understand the end you have to read the book, don't waist your time with this one.	2001-11-27
En todos lados se coecen habas	Es un libro muy realista en cuanto al manejo de comida en cualquier parte del mundo, parte del problema que se escribe en el libro y por supuesto queda en el aire, es que hacer para que dicho manejo sea m&aacute;s higi&eacute;nico y menos bur&oacute;crata, cosa que  es casi imposible en nuestra &eacute;poca, a lo mejor m&aacute;s adelante alguien har&aacute; algo para mejorar la calidad de los alimentos y sus establecimientos, la duda sigue estando en el aire.	2001-11-13
Un libro repetitivo	La primera mitad del libro es repetitiva y un poco aburrida, a los 10 protagonistas les pasa lo mismo y &quot;nadie&quot; se da cuenta, la segunda mitad del libro es la que vale la pena leer, y adem&aacute;s no hay que leer toda la primera mitad para entender la segunda mitad, por otro lado es un libro f&aacute;cil y r&aacute;pido de leer.	2001-11-13
No es el titulo correcto del libro	La trama del libro es buena, pero es muy poco de lo se habla sobre la gen&eacute;tica es un libro m&aacute;s bien policial, me hubiera gustado m&aacute;s (por el estado de &aacute;nimo seguramente) si el t&iacute;tulo fuera otro, pues cuando uno cree que va a leer algo (gen&eacute;tica en este caso) y el libro apenas menciona el tema baja el estado de &aacute;nimo hacia el libro.	2001-11-13
It is a good book but something is missing	In this book you can see how a woman can hate a man and the man can still love that woman, but the hate of these persons is because he kills her adoptive mother, but in book never say why he killed her, all the book is rolling in that hating all the time, and you don't know why he did that, you hate him and maybe he killed her in self defense. The rest of the story is full of action and courage of all the protagonists.	2001-11-13
No te dejaras atrapar	Una novela de espias y gobiernos realmente excitante, donde uno aprende a no confiar en nadie pues cada quien trabaja para su propio provecho sin importarles nada ni nadie.	2001-11-13
Who is responsible?	This could be an amazing real story, he knows his family and how they think of him, so that's why he want to take revenge in his testament, may be this is because the way he educate them and in that case who's the responsible for their acts?	2001-11-13
The finish of the book...	This is an interesting book of Africa, you learn about the land and the people there, but how many times can a person trick or be tricked by the same person? At the end of the book he left many things at the air, for example: you really don't know what happened with the hunt company of Sean Courtney and other things.	2001-11-13
You almost know the end of the book at the begining	The problem of this book is that you know in the first pages who is the bad guy, so you know that he will have to lose at the end.  The way they are living in the village I think that is a little bit out of the reality.	2001-11-09
This is a book that you have to read backwards	I read this book backwards, because I bought first the 3rd book instead of the first (in Mexico are 3 books), I started in the scroll 7, 8, 9, 10 and olimpo's scroll, and then I read from the first to the 6th, I think this is the way to read this book and to get hooked with Cleopatra.	2001-11-08
Action	If you really want to read a book of action, love and spies, this is the book you have to read, from the first page to the last, you will be interested in the story of all the persons involved, including the 5 years old child.	2001-11-08
Not always you can decide to read a book just for the title	When my wife gave me this book I didn't want to read it because I thought I knew what a Geisha is (I was very wrong), when you start reading this book you'll get amazed of how cruel could be some parents, and even if the parents were good (like pumpkin parents that were dead, her uncle was the bad guy). But in this story you see how even a kid could survive in a good way even if she had almost everything against. The story is a pleasant one when you read it, nothing is boring, and you really learn about the Geisha's life.	2001-08-25
