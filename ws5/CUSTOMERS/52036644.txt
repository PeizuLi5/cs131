MMMMMMMMMMMMM...CAKE!!!	I absolutely loved this book!  Every time Ruth started to make a cake, I just wanted to reach in for a bite!  I had the book finished in less than 48 hours and loved every page!  Can't wait to read the next Julie and Romeo book!!!!	2005-10-04
Great Southern fiction!!!!	I love the kooky girls in this series and this one adds Chiffon's sister, Chenille.  Chenille comes to town toting her terrier, Walter and causes quite a stir. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book!	2005-10-03
Kristin does it again!!!!	It's hard for me to find a Kristin Hannah book I don't like.  This one was great...how can you not fall in love with Izzy and Nick?  I was happy with Annie's final decision. Blake was just a pompous specimen of a man...one that gives men a bad name!	2005-10-01
Great Reading!!!	While I am a huge fan of Steph Plum, JE's \\"little breaks\\" are a pleasant change.  This book was quick reading and very good.  I hope to see future stories about Kate and Dave.	2005-09-25
Pretty Good!	I enjoy all of Candace Bushnell's novels!  This one was about Wendy, Nico and Victory and their various expeditions.....somewhat of a \\"Sex and the City\\" type deal.  Good beach reading!	2005-09-25
Smashing!	What a wonderful book....i really cant say enough! Marilyn was such a whirlwind and her friends were a trip.  This book has to be my favorite of all TM novels!	2005-09-19
Great summer reading!	I really enjoyed this book. KH has a style of writing that really captures the reader's attention.  She never fails to entertain.  Birdie and Jack had been married for 24 yrs. and everything seemed to fall apart.  Daughters Jamie and Steph were away at college and Birdie was restless. Jack moves to NY and finds the single life grand.	2005-09-10
Great Reading!	Sophie doesn't fail to delight in this newest book.  I actually liked it better than her \\"Shopaholic\\" series. Samantha leaves her high-tech world for something totally different and realizes that different can be good!	2005-09-06
Great Book!!!!	Not often do i find a book that keeps my attention....until this one!  Avery, Rette and Jen are three single women with a whole boatload of problems with the opposite sex.  Great laughs and good twists!	2005-09-06
Pretty Decent	I love SB as an author.  I do prefer her romance novels, but this book did not disappoint.  It was thrilling with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure.	2005-08-31
One of the best....	This book was one of the best I've read so far.  While \\"Bad Girl Creek\\" wasnt one of my favorites, this little gem sure was.  I couldn't put it down, I was so intrigued by it...especially Phoebe and Sally.  Can't wait to read \\"Goodbye Earl.\\"	2005-08-20
Not her best	I found myself skimming pages in this book to get it over with.  I did like the ending and enjoyed Rebecca and her kids, but i could have done without Huey, Abigail and Julian.  Anxious to read the next DBF offering!	2005-08-16
I've Read Better	i really have mixed feelings about this book....while I liked the part where Maggie and Connie were traveling, the rest of the book really was boring.  I was anxious to finish it only to get rid of it.  Too bad, could have been a decent book!	2005-08-09
Wonderful!	After reading \\"Wildwood\\" i was a bit skeptical about trying this book.  I was very suprised at how much i enjoyed it.  Micki and Beth showed me how teenagers these days aren't the \\"little angels\\" everyone thinks they are.  Great reality reading!	2005-08-06
Can I give 6 stars?	This book was so great that i sat and read it in 2 trips to the pool. Kept my attention and then some.  So now my next adventure will be to find all of SEP books and read them all!  Great Book!!!!	2005-08-02
Not Bad!!!	WHile this book seemed a bit tedious for me to get through...i did enjoy it for the most part, especially Petie and Eddie.  I am anxious to read another Dianne Hammond book.	2005-07-31
Cute book!	While I didnt exactly love this book, it was a cute look into a Jewish girl's experiences growing up.  I admire Susan for putting this on paper for us to read.	2005-07-14
I Just Couldn't Do it!!!!!	I struggled to page 147 of this book and finally gave up.  I hate to toss away a book without giving it a chance...but this was just not good.  Lack of character profiles, lack of good storyline and no excitement made for very hard reading!	2005-07-10
Cute Story!	I liked this book, especially Juan and Phoebe.  I can't wait to read \\"Along Came Mary\\" and \\"Goodbye Earl\\" to find out what happens next!	2005-07-09
Great Story!	While I greatly enjoyed this book, it fell short of 5 stars by just a bit.  Lizzie grapples w/ the death of her parents and being raised by a priest uncle, who turns out to be a  bit more than anyone expects.  The disappearance of him and the story that unfolds kept my attention enough to finish in 2 days.	2005-07-05
So-So	I sat and read this book by the pool and finished it in a day.  It left me with no great opinion.  While it was good enough to keep my attention...I cant say it was really great.	2005-07-03
Good book but lacks some ooomph!!	While I did read this book in 2 days...i didn't get the \\"warm fuzzies\\" I usually get when reading a Steph Plum book.  Not enough Grandma Mazur for my taste.	2005-07-03
I liked it...but there were things that could have been skipped!	While I love Lorna Landvik's books...this one was a bit boring at parts...i found myself skipping entire paragraphs to get back to Frau Katte, Slim, Fenny, Lee and and Miss Penk.  The actor scenes bored me to tears and i just wanted them over and done with.  Better luck with the next book!	2005-06-30
nice blast from the past	While these 2 stories were from the late 1980's, they held my interest enough to finish in 2 nights.  I think the second story was much better...the first one was a bit too far-fetched for my taste.	2005-06-24
Good reading....	\\"Your Oasis on....\\" was a pretty good book for the most part.  I had a bit of a hard time with switching people for each chapter, but all in all...it was a good read.	2005-06-20
Good ending to a decent series	While I am a fan of V.C. Andrews...after her death during the Casteel Series, things have fallen by the wayside.  The Gemini series has been one of the best so far.  While the ending might have been a bit too predictable, I still enjoyed it.  Can't wait for the next series to start.	2005-06-13
Not as good as the other "Full" books	I found \\"Full Bloom\\" lacking a bit in the storyline and not as funny or as good as the other books in the series.  I think Janet needs to go back to her roots with Steph Plum and Lula and give us more entertainment in that area.	2005-06-06
Wonderful!	I real A LOT of books and this has to be one of the best I've ever picked up.  Smithy jumps on his bike and takes off from Rhode Island to California...complete with plenty of body fat and very little else.  Along the way, he makes friends, finds himself and closes the door to a previous life.  GREAT book!	2005-05-24
loved it!!!	This was a truly wonderful book.  When Oswald Campbell moves to Alabama he never imagined what his life would be like.  Loved little Patsy and Jack.	2005-05-15
Elizabeth never disappoints!!!	I see that some people didnt like this book very much...i beg to differ.  Elizabeth Berg has a style of writing like no other.  This book was excellent.  Betta and Matthew were my favorites and Jovani was a hoot!  I can't wait to get my hands on her next book!	2005-05-14
This one was like not love...	I love JG's style of writing.  While this book isnt nearly as good as her others, i found it to be pretty good.  Lisa was a snake and Linda drove me insane.	2005-05-09
Love those Calhoun women!!!!	\\"Megan's Mate\\" was my favorite story in this set.  While all of the Calhouns are great..this story was a bit different since Megan wasn't one of the 4 sisters.  Great reading....and Kevin was such a little sweetie!	2005-05-07
Not a bad book	While I was a huge fan of \\"Patty Jane's House of Curl\\"....this book doesn't quite measure up to it.  I did enjoy the plot as far as Violet goes...the rest was just tedious reading and i wanted to be finished quicker than i was.	2005-05-01
Yummy!!!	I always enjoy a chick-lit book and this one was no exception.  While it wasn't a five-star book like \\"Patty Jane's House...\\" I truly enjoyed the antics of Faith, Merit, Slip, Audrey and Kari.  Can't wait to enjoy LL's next book.	2005-04-28
I didn't love it......	While i did enjoy this book somewhat...i agree with the other reviewers that it wasn't quite up to snuff with the first two books.  I did enjoy the storyline with Sidda, Little Shep,Lulu and Baylor...the rest was just filler and gave me a slight headache.	2005-04-17
Can't complain	While this book left me completely puzzled at times, I did enjoy it for the most part.  The ending was a true surprise for me.	2005-04-14
Blech!!!	This book was one of the most boring things I've ever read.  It made no sense whatsoever and i didnt even finish...i dropped it back in the library's bin.	2005-04-02
Good..but not as good as the first......	While I enjoyed this book..i found it to be not as good as the first.  My favorite storyline is Beth and Sonny and Sonny's beast of a mother.  All in all...a good read.	2005-03-20
I've read better!!	While I've never met a RG book I haven't liked, this one wasnt her best work.  Between Kate's attitude and Rob's lack of interest, i did have to bounce back and forth with their moods.  I won't say it wasn't good, it just wasn't all that great.	2005-03-20
Not one of her best	As a huge fan of SB, i found this book falling short of her later offerings.  I did find it pleasant enough to read in under 24 hours, but it didnt hold much drama and intrigue.	2005-03-13
Sometimes I wonder!	I sometimes wonder where DS is when she's writing these stories...I was worn out by hearing about Liam's personality issues and his age difference with Sasha.  It got old very quick.  I struggled through the last part of the book wondering how I would manage to finish.  I'd say the next book needs to be more exciting and unique.	2005-03-11
Barbara does it again!!!	I love all of BB's books and this one is no exception.  Maddy and Aidan prepare to walk down the aisle, but are sidestepped by Aidan's teenage daughter, Kelly.  Great follow up to Shore Lights and can't wait for the next book!	2005-02-23
nice storyline...with confusion built right in.....	While I really enjoyed this book...i had a hard time following along at times when we switched chapters.  I really liked Layla, she was my favorite in the entire book.  Can't wait to sample more SM books soon!	2005-02-14
Wonderful!	This is my second MKA book, and i loved it as much as Hissy Fit.  Katherine and M.B. kept me laughing, as did Dinky Davis, AKA Parker.  I can't wait to read more!	2005-02-06
What Great Reading!!!!	I usually find Joy Fielding's writing to be exceptional.  This book did not disappoint!  I loved the mix of suspense, sorrow and romance and really liked the chemistry between Ben and Amanda.  Joy....keep up the good work and look forward to your next novel!	2005-01-30
More Charlie, please!	I wonder if JC can do a sequel to this book...I wanna see what happens to Grady and of course Allie and Charlie!  All-in-all, a good book.  Can't wait for another!	2005-01-23
Sounds like my luck!!!!	I truly loved this book.  Jane reminded me so much of myself.  After going on one blind date after another, Jane finally see the light that Grammy was leading her to.  Two thumbs up for this one!	2005-01-15
very good...but...	While I enjoyed the basic plot of this book, it became hard after awhile to remember who was talking in each chapter.  I felt the story should have just been told by Sarah instead of jumping back and forth every chapter.  All-in-all, a very good read!	2005-01-10
Short and Sweet	While I am a huge fan of NR, these 2 books lack the strength of her latest books.  These 2 stories were short...so short in fact, one can read them in a 2-hour sitting!	2005-01-05
Wonderful!	I thank Kristin Hannah for a wonderful book!  She may just become my favorite author!  Claire and Meg havent been close in years, until Claire gets bad news and Meg takes matters into her own hands.  Great story of siblings who find each other after a long separation...and an adorable five year old to boot!	2005-01-02
Great mix of suspense, silliness and sweat!	I think MKA is my new favorite author.  I loved this book, especially Keeley and Austin.  I look forward to more!!!	2004-12-25
Sorry....just not my bag!	While I wanted to like this book...i found my mind wandering as i attempted to read it.  It just wasn't very interesting and i finally gave up after 60 pages.	2004-12-20
Wonderful!	I must say this book was great.  I sat down and read it in 2 evenings.  I was sad to see Charlotte go and hope AS can write a sequel to this book...I wanna know what happens!	2004-12-16
I love NR and can't wait for more!	While the reviews I read here before I started this book kind of made me wonder, I found this book to be wonderful.  After Stella loses her husband, she and her two sons move back to Tennessee to be near her family.  Logan Kitridge comes into the picture and love \\"blooms.\\"  Sure, it's the same old plot, but has a good, fresh set of characters.  Who could ask for more?  I can't wait to read Black Rose.	2004-12-14
well....	I can say i liked the characters in this book.  The part i could have done without was the whole Jane Austen theme.  Would have been a good book otherwise.	2004-12-11
not bad for a first-time writer	While I wanted to give this book 4 stars, the dialogue between Charlotte and Dolly prevented me from doing so.  That part of the book was the only flaw i could find.  I did think Skip and \\"Blossom\\" had some chemistry, but their conversations sounded like first graders talking on a playground.  I did like the book overall, and will read RS next offering.	2004-12-06
Very great book	This was my first PS book.  I have to say...it was wonderful.  The individual stories of Tess, Grace, Liz and Lovey made this book a winner.  I will be looking into more PS reading in the future!	2004-12-02
Different...but in a good way	While Barney was no Stephanie...she didn't fail to amuse us in the least.  Hooker and Judey added extra spice to this book and I was glad to see the absence of a female side-kick for Barney.  Not a 5-star read...I save those for Ms. Plum!	2004-11-28
The Best of the Best!!!	I truly loved this book.  The ending left me speechless!!!  Great work..can't wait to read more!	2004-11-27
Wonderful right to the last page!!!	As I'm a huge fan of NR, most of her books are a \\"4\\" in my eyes.  This one, however, deserves a \\"10\\".  Never before has Nora taken us to such a quaint little town you just want to go to and see for yourself.  Nate and meg were something else....she reminds me so much of myself.  I just couldn't put this book down!!!!  Great work, Nora...i look forward to reading your next novel!	2004-11-26
I loved it!!!!	This book was wonderful! I will agree with previous reviewers who said it was very different than her previous books.  Different can be good.  Though we had a lot more talking in this book, we learned to love Linda, Lindsay and Gracie.  Add Alex and Louise to the mix, and it made for a great party.  I wasn't too keen on Brad and Robert, but they were ok enough to make it through.  I read this in less than 24 hours and will be diving into Dot's next book with relish!	2004-11-15
Good...but...	This book was really, really good for the first part...not so great in the middle and returned to good at the end.  I laughed aloud at parts where Hannah encountered her rival, Lucy for Jason's attention.  I don't think this book was quite as good as some of her previous work.	2004-11-14
Nora does it again	After reading the previous reviews here...i decided to only read the NR story.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  I loved Simone and Gabriel.  The story was too short for my liking, it left me wanting more!	2004-11-07
another great one	I really liked this book, despite reading the flap and finding out what era it took place in.  Beata and Antoine beat the odds and make themselves a decent life with their two daughters, until tragedy strikes more than once.  I really admired Amadea's efforts in the end of the book, although some parts were repetitive and boring.	2004-11-07
Another great Becky book!!!!	While I never did read \\"Confessions of....\\"  I really enjoyed all the other books in this series, and this one is no exception.  We are introduced to Becky's unknown sister in this story and she sure shakes Becky up.  Can't wait to read the next one! <br />	2004-11-01
Better than the first book	I was not too thrilled with the first book in this series, i did, however...like this one much better.  Baby Celeste turns into a \\"mini-Sarah\\" and Betsy appears to make everyone's lives a living hell.  I can't wait to read the next book, which i think will tell baby Celeste's story.	2004-10-30
Very twisted story...	I don't want to say i disliked this book..I didn't love it like the \\"Flowers\\" series...but it did reflect back to it in a way.  Sarah has some big issues when she decides to turn Celeste into her brother Noble...and then keeps Celeste from being a mother to her own child.  I can't wait to read Black Cat.	2004-10-24
Janet has a knack for these books!	Thumbs up for this one..Daisy and Steve have a rocky road to travel, but somehow manage, despite an old lady, a huge dog and a teenage brother.  Can't wait for her next one!	2004-10-24
Her Best	I really liked Jennifer's firt two books...but I loved this one even more!  Kelly, Becky, Ayinde and Lia were characters you couldn't help but like...so much so you want to meet them for real.	2004-10-14
My first but not my last!	This was my first Kristin Hannah book and i was not disappointed in the least.  I really loved Angie and Lauren and don't blame Lauren for her choice in the end.  I will definitely be reading more Kristin Hannah in the future!	2004-10-10
I just didn't get it!	While the middle of this book was entertaining, the rest was boring and quite stupid.  I wasn't much of a fan of Bridget Jones, either, so I shouldn't be too surprised this book wasn't much better!	2004-10-07
NO WAY!!!!!	I'm so glad i borrowed this book from the library..had i plunked down the cash for it, i'd have been pretty upset.  This book was soooooo boring...i made it to page 97 and decided to call it quits...no way was i going to try to finish it seeing my attention span was nill.  I'm very surprised because LH usually writes such great, engrossing books.  Don't waste your money on this one!	2004-10-03
Sandra Brown in her previous life	While I enjoy everything Sandra Brown writes...I now realize why she went to writing novels.  This story was good, but very unbelievable.  What's the chances a woman(virgin, no less) meets a man in an elevator, sleeps with him, leaves the city and ends up pregnant as the result.  Not only does the man come looking for her, but ends up marrying her and ending up with twins. Ah, if only life went this smoothly!	2004-10-02
Like but not love....	I can't say I LOVED this book, but it wasn't as bad as some reviewers claimed it to be.  All of the Brooklyn girls worked on my nerves a bit, but i did enjoy Kate and Billy and Elliot and Brice.	2004-10-01
Liked but not loved..	I truly enjoyed Sullivan's Island...so i was hoping this book would be just as good.  Not true...the first part was a bit dull but once Emily, David, Bettina and Brigitte came aboard, all was well.  I finished it with a positive feeling and will continue to read DBF in the future.	2004-09-26
certainly not her best	While SA is by far one of my favorite authors...this book wasn't as good as some of her earlier works. Esme may have thrown a wrench into the whole plot, thus making the story a bit dull.	2004-09-17
Dull and hard to finish	While I love Sandra Brown's writing, this book fell short by a long shot.  I couldn't like any of the characters and just wanted the book to be finished.  I even considered skipping a few pages towards the end to get it back to the library on time. It's sad to think a SB book took me almost 14 days to read.  Better luck next time!	2004-09-14
Good but not great!	I tend to love Rachel Gibson in general.  This book wasn't great, but wasn't all that bad either.  I think the thing that disturbed me most was the fact that there were many typos throughout the book, \\"passed\\", \\"where\\", etc.  Nothing worse than a book that isn't free of spelling errors.	2004-08-29
Cute!!!!	This book isn't my favorite by far, but Nina was certainly an entertaining character, to say the least.  I really enjoyed Bono and had mixed feelings about Billy.  I liked how the author gave character profiles for each of the canine charges Nina walked each day.	2004-08-20
Best wedding story I've ever read!!!!	\\"Something Borrowed\\" was just the best wedding story I've read so far!  Dex is set to marry Rachel's best friend, Marcy.  All hell breaks loose and everything is turned upside down.  Great book!	2004-08-07
Excellent!	I'm a big fan of AT, and this book was not disappointing in the least!  Being from Pennsylvania, I could really identify with this book.  Nella's story reminded so much of my own family's life, especially working in the quarry,living on the farm and only going to school to grade 7.  I so loved Renato and Chettie.  Way to go, Adriana, give us MORE!!!!	2004-08-01
Wow..I almost forgot this was a Jane Green book!!!!	This has to be by far the BEST JG book yet!  I was so wrapped up with Joe, Alice and Josie that I almost forgot whose book I was reading.  Sure...Joe was a sleaze..sure....he almost made me run scared from men...but this book was just packed full of interesting scenarios that I couldn't put it down!!!!	2004-07-28
Barbara Bretton at her best!!!!	I so loved this book!  Even though Maggy and Conor were lovers from afar at first, i couldnt help but fall in love with this book!  I especially loved the trials and tribulations Maggy had with her daughter, Nicole.  Thumbs up and I'm on to the next BB book!	2004-07-24
This one is my favorite!	I've read nearly all of EB's books and i found this one to be my favorite so far.  I felt like I was living in the house with Sharla and Ginny and could picture Marion and Georgia so clearly.  The end of the book kind of left me hanging...but i truly enjoyed every page!	2004-07-19
Elizabeth Berg can write a book!	As an avid reader, I find that EB books really keep my attention.  This one was no exception!  Nan takes off on a &quot;finding&quot; road trip and finds herself everywhere and anywhere.  I kept thinking that any moment Martin was going to call via cell phone and beg her to come home!	2004-07-14
EEEEEEYYYEEEEWWWWWW!!!!	Talk about superficial!  Every character in this book was more concerned about the label in her underwear and the exact shade of her hair to even have any depth.  Don't waste your money!!!!!	2004-07-12
A bit disappointing.....	I was very eager to read this book and did in 2 days time..but it was a bunch of whining and fighting.  I didn't care much for Fiona, a spoiled. selfish, unbending woman, or John, a pushy widower with two spoiled brat kids.  All we seemed to dwell on in this book was the lack of closet space in Fiona's house....BOY...what a crisis...she couldn't marry a man because she'd have to give up her closet space!!!!  And John kept pushing her to marry him and then when she did...he expected things to go his way.  Two spoiled selfish people in the book...neither willing to bend for the other.  Sorry, Danielle, but you'll have to do better to earn my 5 stars!	2004-07-03
I 've read better!	I realize this is an early book by NR.  I got this in the &quot;Engaging the Enemy&quot; 2-story series.  I felt Pandora and Michael were a bit too close for comfort and she was pretty unbearable at times.  I'm glad Nora has come a long way since then.	2004-07-01
Perfect blend of passion and suspense!	As an avid reader, I strive to find books that are not only suspenseful but fun, too.  This book fit the bill perfectly.  Charlee was a real firecracker and Mason was a trip!  Add Nolan and Maybelline and it makes the perfect story for a beachchair read!	2004-06-26
I liked it but......	I can say i liked this book alot...but I didn't LOVE this book.  Things seemed to be missing, while other things were too much in the spotlight. I didn't like the ending very much.  Does Janet not know that Victoria's Secret makes the MIRACLE bra, not the WONDERBRA?  I guess I'm fit to be tied until number 11 comes out for us to find out what happens with Valerie and Albert.	2004-06-26
Not her best....	I usually really love Elizabeth Berg's books.  While i did read this one in 2 days...it surely lacked the depth and character of some of her early works.  Everyone perceived Caroline as crazy...until the true secret was revealed near the end of the book.  I wish I could have given this book 4 stars...but it fell short by a few chapters!	2004-06-19
Her best so far!!!!	I really have to disagree with most of the reviews of this book. I felt this one was her best book so far...i simply could not put it down and finished it in less than 24 hours.  Tasha was a bit shallow at times...but almost every man she came in contact with reminded me of one I'd come across myself.  I loved Andy, Mel and Emma, too, and can't wait to read &quot;To Have and To Hold&quot;.	2004-06-15
Not what I'd call her best by far!	I could barely read these 2 stories without gagging.  The first one was pure stupidity and the second one was too confusing to follow.  With &quot;Her Mother's Keeper&quot;  I found Luke to be so totally 2-sided...one minute he was all over Gwen, the next he was pushing her away.  Thank god that Nora has brushed up on her romantic writing skills in the past decade of writing!	2004-06-13
Linda Howard knows her stuff!!!!	I purchaesd this book a few years ago and finally picked it up last week to read.  Wow!!!  What a good read!  I really loved Sarah's toughness throughout the book, even after everything that happened and her dealings with Cahill.  I plan on getting my hands on more of Linda's book in the near future.	2004-06-12
Ummmmm.....not so good	I read this book as part of a 2-book volume &quot;With Open Arms&quot;.  I can surely see how this was one of Nora's early works, due to the fact that it was pure drivel.  Samantha was a spineless character and Jake was a pig.  I'm so glad Nora has come along way from this depth-lacking story!	2004-06-12
I tried to like it...i really did!!!	I really wanted to like this book...but by page 51...my interest was totally gone.  I never bothered to finish it.  It was stuffed full of characters whom i felt had no personality and everything was too confusing to keep track of.  I think I'd better stick to Rachel Gibson, Barbara Bretton and Nora Roberts...they hold my interest FAR better! Maybe I'm just not a marriage-material girl!!!!!!	2004-06-06
Not my favorite	While I did really like JoJo and Mark, the other two heroines were a bit boring.  This book lacked alot of the spark in Marian Keye's previous novels.	2004-06-05
A true love story	I fell in love with Barbara Bretton with &quot;Girls of Summer.&quot;  While I did enjoy &quot;One and Only&quot;, it didn't live up to &quot;Shore Lights&quot; and &quot;Girls of Summer&quot;.  While I detested Julianna and Eric, I did fall in love with Isabelle and Daniel.	2004-05-29
Good sequel	While i did enjoy this book alot...i didnt think it came as close to being as good as the first.  I agree with the reviewer who said the characters were not fully developed...and I also found it hard to keep track of who was talking in each chapter.  I do hope to see a sequel to this book...I'd enjoy finding out whether it was Sophie or Jude born.	2004-05-25
What a Perfect Book!	I'd give this book six stars if I could.  Marsha Moyer has a real talent for telling a story...and Lucy's story is well-worth the effort to read.  After Ash Farrell comes tumbling into her newly-widowed life, Lucy Hatch is turned upside down! GREAT READING!	2004-05-21
The Best &quot;Full&quot; book of all!	While i did enjoy the first three books in this series, I liked this one the best.  Vera finally wakes up and starts to really come alive and Max and Jamie managed to keep the danger to a minimum.  I'm sad to see the series end, I want more Max and Jamie!	2004-05-16
Great reading in this one!	As an avid reader, I'm always looking for some new, fresh material.  This book fit the bill perfectly.  Sophie leaves her town after the death of her husband and encounters some new, fresh faces.  Crystal was my favorite in this book..and with Sophie's help, she turns out pretty decent.	2004-05-12
I Can't Say I loved it	I really wanted to enjoy this book, but found myself putting it down and not picking it up again for a few days.  Usually Jennifer Crusie really delights me...but this book just didn't make the cut in my opinion!	2004-05-09
Fell short of being a great read	As an avid reader, I found this book to be quite lacking for the most part.  Where I loved Lester and some of Frannie's episodes, I felt that Calvin was lacking depth of character for the most part.  I guess I might have been expecting something quite different from this book.	2004-04-25
Positively wonderful!!!!!	&quot;Shore Lights&quot; was another great book by Barbara Bretton.  The story of Maddy and Hanna Bainbridge and her friend Aidan O'Malley and his daughter, Kelly.  I really got into this book and could not put it down.	2004-04-24
Not great...Not bad	I did like this book for the most part.  I did, however..yearn for Becky Bloomwood instead of Emma.  The ending was a bit too typical for my tastes, but overall, it was an OK book.	2004-04-18
Decent book but not as good as the first two	I would be lying if i said i didn't like this book.  I did enjoy it for the most part.  I felt the other two books about Becky were much better and easier to read.  This one lacked some depth. I was pretty amazed at what Becky did at the ending...now that took some serious guts!	2004-04-11
I feel like it's a book about MY life!!!!	&quot;Confessions of&quot; was excellent...it deserves 6 stars!  Rebecca gets herself into a money rut and runs.  She sounds so much like me, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her.  Things start looking up near the end...I also recommend &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan!&quot;	2004-04-04
I really liked this book!	I was a bit skeptical about reading this book after seeing other reviews.  Turns out i really liked it.  It was a bit far-fetched at times, but overall it was a good read.<br />Note to reader from Kentucky......this book IS a reprint from the 80's!	2004-03-28
One of the best books I've ever read!	This book was so spectacular...I could not put it down for more than a minute.  I'm an avid reader and this book was by far, one of the best I've ever read.  I really loved the storyline between the teachers. I will definitely be hunting for more of this author's books.	2004-03-24
I've read better...	While I did like this book(which was part of the &quot;Mysterious&quot; 3-book collaboration) I think it could have been a bit more exciting.	2004-03-21
Not her best writing by far....	While I thought these three stories were OK...I felt that the author has grown by leaps and bounds with her newer offerings.  These stories didn't hold my attention like her current books do.  &quot;The Right Path&quot; was the best of the three.	2004-03-21
A cute, fast read!	I enjoyed this early work of NR.  It was cute and a bit on the sweet side, but entertaining.	2004-03-20
A stellar performance!!!!	I am soooooo happy that I opted to purchase this book.  Not only was the story fascinating and at times sad, it gave me a huge perspective on Ozzy's behavior and what makes him tick.  The photo bonus in the middle of the book is a true treasure.  It was so good, I read the whole thing from cover to cover in less than 3 hours!  Definitely worth every penny spent!	2004-03-20
Not so good	First, let me say, I'm a huge fan of NR.  This book just wasn't as good as most of her other stories.  I just couldn't get into the storyline and felt the book was lacking some depth.	2004-03-20
Not my cup of tea	While the plot of this book may be great...I'm not one for &quot;letter writing&quot; novels.  I had a hard time keeping track of who Olivia was writing to on each page.  I think the book would have been better if we'd have heard from the other people Olivia wrote to.  The characters were not developed very much and the whole &quot;show-biz&quot; letters part was too much drivel for my taste.	2004-03-14
Absolutely Wonderful!!!!!	This book was wonderful.  I really enjoyed Trudy and Jade, and was pleased with the final outcome of the book.  I'd have liked to have heard more about Shannelle and her husband, Tony.  I plan to read more by this author in the future.	2004-03-13
Not her best by far	While I did enjoy &quot;Ransom&quot;, I didn't feel that this was one of DS best books.  I was happy to see that it wasn't the same old, same old as some of her previous books.  I did not, however,  like the mystery aspect of the book.  I found the middle of the book to be dull and found myself skipping whole paragraphs at times.  Mystery/thriller novels are not DS style.  I did enjoy Ted and Fernanda's exchanges throughout the book, and Sam was my favorite character.	2004-03-07
Not her best work	While I did enjoy &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, I found it to be a bit boring compared to some of NR other offerings.  Ryan and Pierce were not as exciting as some of her other characters, but it was a good read for the most part.	2004-03-06
Even better than the first one.....	I truly enjoyed &quot;Midnight Flight&quot;.  It was even better than the first book, which I enjoyed very much.  This sequel provides a look into what really happens to Teal, Phoebe and Robin.  Along the way, they encounter Mindy and Gia.  They work hard, play little and get reprimanded for everything they do.  Gia finally decides to do something about the situation and the ending was superb!!!!  I'm sorry that there isn't another book to read about these three girls!  I look forward to &quot;Celeste&quot;.	2004-02-29
Very entertaining	The only thing keeping me from giving this book five stars was the ending.  While I loved the entire book, I felt everything needed to be settled, which didn't happen.  I can only hope there will be a sequel to this book so we can find out what really happens to Faye, Shirley, Alice and Marilyn.  I'd also love to hear what becomes of Lila's sister Dora.	2004-02-29
Much better than the last series!!!	I really enjoyed &quot;Broken Wings.&quot;  After being very disappointed with the last 2 series of books, I was extremely happy to read this book.  My favorite was Robin, daughter of a wanna-be country singer.  I'm looking forward to reading &quot;Midnight Flight.&quot;	2004-02-22
Won't disappoint a fan	&quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot;  was really good.  I love IRD and she didn't disappoint me with this book.  While Beaches is my all-time favorite..this book takes a close second.  I truly enjoyed Sunny.	2004-02-22
I really loved this book!!!	As a true NR fan...i really enjoyed this small taste of her former writing....not too light, not too heavy...just alot of pleasurable reading!!! Charity and Roman have a bit more in common than each thought possible....great twists and turns for this book!	2004-02-07
A wonderful, cozy read for a winter night!	I truly enjoyed &quot;A Soft Place to Fall.&quot;  Annie and Sam were just spectacular...as was Claudia.  I do think I like  &quot;Girls of Summer&quot;, the sequel a bit better than this book...but this one is a keeper!!!!!	2004-02-01
One of the best books I've ever read!	&quot;Girls of Summer&quot; was my first Barbara Bretton book.  I really, really fell in love with her style of writing and her characters.  I just loved Ellen, Deirdre and Hall...and of course Stanley!  I can't say enough about this book...except that I really look forward to read the pre-quel to this, as well as all of her other books.  Way to go Barbara, you have a winner here!	2004-01-29
Not as good as her recent books	As a huge fan of NR...i could tell from page 3 of this book that it was an early release.  It lacked character and depth...sure...the story was cute and fairy-tale....but overall it was too short and too &quot;fluffy&quot; for my taste.	2004-01-24
Ick...barely worth the 1 star rating.....	I tried to like this book, really, i did...but the only part i could stand to read was &quot;Dark Seed.&quot;  The first half just couldn't keep my attention.  I'm glad to be finished with this series and hope to have better luck with Broken Wings and Midnight Flight.	2004-01-19
Baby WOW!!!!!	I enjoyed reading &quot;Babyville.&quot;  I do, however, agree with the reviewer that said Maeve's story was the best of the 3.  Sam was a whiny witch and Julia was a desperate girlfriend.  I felt Mark and Maeve were sooo much better together.  As for Dan....haven't we girls met someone like him in our lives at one time or another?	2004-01-19
Sandra Brown has nailed yet another bestseller!	I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was so good I read it in under 2 days.  I really didn't know who the real killer was until the last chapter and the whole time I was reading i was on the edge of my seat.  Sandra did a superb job with this book and I look forward to future releases!	2004-01-06
Patti Berg is the BEST!!!!	&quot;Stuck on You&quot; contains one wild, leather-clad redhead,one ex-cop turned fishing instructor, four old ladies posing as &quot;sleuths&quot; and a whole lotta fun!!!! Just be sure to read this book when you have plenty of time on your hands..you won't want to put it down!!!!!! Also, read it before &quot;And then He Kissed Me.&quot;	2004-01-04
Best in the series so far!	&quot;Into the Woods&quot; was, as 2 readers pointed out...totally in the WRONG timeframe...i.e. the CDS, rufies, cars, computers, etc. but I found the story to be FAR more entertaining than Willow's story!!!!!  Grace just seem to have more fun and adventure than Willow ever did....despite the pregnancy later in the story.  I look forward to reading &quot;Hidden Leaves.&quot;	2003-12-30
What a great story!	I think I liked &quot;Best Laid Plans&quot; as much as &quot;Loving Jack.&quot; And seeing as they came as a set in &quot;Love By Design&quot;..it was the perfect book to cozy up with.  Abra is a headstrong woman who won't bend for any man...until she meets Cody Johnson.  Two thumbs up for Nora!!!!	2003-12-27
Nora knows how to write a love story!	Though I read this book as part of a 2-book installment...i found it very good in plot.  Jackie &quot;Jack&quot; meets dashing Nathan...a man of few words but many emotions and they go through a turbulent relationship.    I really liked the ending, though it was pretty predictable!	2003-12-25
UMMMMM...not what I was expecting!	When I picked up &quot;Full Speed&quot; I was so hoping it would be good like &quot;Full House&quot; and &quot;Full Tilt.&quot;  Boy...was I wrong!!!!!  This book had no depth to it and no great storyline.  Jamie and Max may as well have been on different planets for all the action that was lacking between them.  I surely hope Janet does a better job on her next installment!	2003-12-25
A good piece of Hollywood dazzle!	&quot;Hollywood Divorces&quot; was exactly what i was looking for in a steamy Hollywood-style book.  It was easy to read..had plenty of action..and finished with a bang like most of Ms. Collins' previous books.  I found Nick and Cat to be my favorite couple in this book....I'd love to see a sequel!	2003-12-14
The best of the series so far!	After reading &quot;Wicked Forest...I didn't know what to expect from this book.  I was truly surprised that I liked it more than the first two.  Sure, Hannah was a whiner...but at least she did something adventurous!!!!!  I didn't care for the ending much...but it was a great book!	2003-12-06
Finally...something i could sink my teeth into!	I'm a big fan of DS...i plodded through each and every one of her books.  This one, finally, was one i could glide through with minimal repetiveness and lots of storyline and good character development.  DS...great job...keep up the good work!	2003-11-30
Not as good as Willow	I thought since &quot;Willow&quot; was such a great start to this series that I'd love &quot;Wicked Forest....&quot;  Nothing was farther from the truth.  Shallow characters such as Thatcher and Manon made the book almost sickening to read.  I certainly hope the ghostwriter has cooked up something much more spectacular in the next book...I'm getting tired of the dull storylines! I've also noticed in all of V.C.'s books that the title character has always given birth to a daughter....let's mix it up a bit and have them birth a male child, shall we?	2003-11-30
Finally!!!!!	Finally...V.C. Andrews' ghostwriter has written a book worthy of V.C. herself!  I was sooooo delighted to find that this book did not once refer to the main character having sexual relations with any of her blood relatives nor ending up pregnant and having to get married.  Willow was indeed one of the first strong characters I've seen since the \\"Heaven\\" series.....which was from 1987!!!!!  I'm looking forward to digging into the remaining books of this series!	2003-11-23
Not bad!!!!	&quot;And then he kissed me&quot; was certainly entertaining....take one blonde-turned brunette named &quot;autumn&quot; a.k.a Juliet, one pink Mustang and five kids.. and you're bound to have a ball of fun and chaos!!!!!  This book is great for a weekend read or to take to the beach!	2003-11-19
Quite the nice bit of reading material!!!!	While I'm not much for archaeology myself...i did find this book to be very interesting and easy to read.  Can't say I blame Cairo for the path she took the first four yrs. of Dylan's life...others may tend to disagree.  Duncan was a virtual threat to himself for most of his life..until Cairo stepped in and changed it all for him!	2003-11-15
Finally!!!	Finally Danielle Steel has written a book that doesn't sound just like all of her others.  Sure....same bit of storyline..but much better developed characters and a refreshing twist.  Pip is a very sweet 11 yr-old girl who wins the heart of painter Matt.  Pip's mother Ophelie was a disturbed mother who had suffered a loss but finds herself again after spending time with Matt.  Add Mousse, the dog, and a few other additions and you have the perfect story.  The ending was a bit far-fetched but overall, this book is a winner!	2003-11-13
A bit of new-author fluff	I have to agree with most of the previous reviews.....this book is one of Ms. Roberts first attempts at romance and it does fall short in many ways.  I wish the characters of Cassidy and Colin had been better developed for the reader to get more enjoyment out of the story.	2003-11-09
Totally lacking any substance	After reading the first three books in this series i felt it was only right to embark on the final installment.  Boy...what a disappointment!  I struggled endlessly to finish it.  It totally lacked substance and had no backbone..nor did its characters, especially Summer.  Talk about a spoiled child!!!!  And the part with Suze and Ed was just enough to make me want to stop and not finsh the book.  I surely hope I'll find what I'm looking for in the &quot;Willow&quot; series. There is something to be said about ghostwriters...and Ms. Andrews' ghostwriter needs to wake up and smell the coffee!	2003-11-02
Much better than Lightning Strikes!	After being disappointed with Lightning Strikes i was a bit skeptical with reading Eye of the Storm.  This book was much better than the first two, focusing more on Rain than her family members.  Alot of people in Rain's life were removed in this book, however, a few new people came into it.  I was pleasantly surprised how quickly i read the book and look forward to finishing the series.	2003-10-27
Boo!  Hiss!  to V.C. ghostwriters on this one!!!!!	&quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; is the second installment in the Hudson series.  I really had a hard time getting into this second installment....not only were the characters pretty dull and boring...but Rain disappoints me with her behavior with the men she encounters along her journey in London.	2003-10-21
V.C. Andrews at her best!!!!!	I admit...i really wanted to stop reading all of V.C. Andrews' books after she died in 1987...none of the books thereafter had that special touch.  I blundered through the Cutler,Landry and Logan series..and didn't feel any were too great...same story...same basic people, etc.  I finally decided to try out the Hudson series and was pleasantly surprised...Rain was gutsy, mouthy and not a little miss goody two shoes like the rest!  I read the book in 1 day and will move on to Lightning Strikes.<br />P.S.  To the reader from D.C.-----the Dollganger series was made into a movie quite a few yrs. ago...&quot;Flowers in the Attic.&quot;	2003-10-13
Rachel Gibson is my heroine!!!!!	I've got to say....i've read quite a few books in my 32 years...but NOBODY writes like Rachel Gibson!!!!  This is by far my favorite book she's written.  Delaney wants nothing more than to gas up her car and get as FAR from Truly as she possibly can...that is...until her stepfather's will keeps her in town for a year and bad-boy Nick comes into the picture once again after 10 yrs...... making life pretty interesting for the tiny town of Truly.	2003-10-13
something different and refreshing	&quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot; was a smash hit!  I loved Eve's take on the trials and tribulations of deciding whether to take the plunge or not....it's almost like a diary of sorts...she relives her whole engagement up until the day of the wedding.	2003-10-04
Not bad...not great	I was hoping this book would follow along the lines of Sophie Kinsella's style of writing...while it wasn't exactly that...it wasn't a bad novel.  Katie makes you want to pity her when she falls victim to Penny Moss...who was totally a witch and then some!  I struggled at certain parts but did finish in less than a week.	2003-09-29
Susan Andersen can't write a BAD book	I really loved &quot;Getting Lucky&quot;....some characters were right out of &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;...so i suggest you read that one first. Lily was the perfect epitome of a &quot;girly-girl&quot; and Zach was the tough-guy Marine.  Superb story...read it in a day and a half!!!!!	2003-09-27
Different  from &quot;Big Stone Gap&quot; series....but very good !!!!	&quot;Lucia Lucia&quot; was a total diversion from the &quot;Big Stone Gap&quot; series...but i found it to be very good reading. It revolves around the lives of an Italian family in New York in the 1950s and i found it to be very enticing and easy to read...once i started, i couldn't put it down!!!!! While I would love to see another Ave Maria installation...i give Adriana a thumbs-up for this novel!!!!!	2003-09-21
What THIS lady wants is a good book!!!!	I was very excited to start &quot;What the lady wants&quot; due to the fact that i have always adored Jennifer Crusie's writing.....this book, however, left alot to be desired for me.  I found the plot to be rather dull and lifeless and found myself struggling to finish it.  The plot dragged on and on and never gave any excitement. Better stick to some of her previous titles for total excitement.	2003-09-21
Not as good as I'd hoped	&quot;River Angel&quot; was an easy read, however, it left me empty inside...kind of like i didn't get a fully developed picture of the characters in my mind.  Chapters seemed long and didn't relate to each other all that much.	2003-09-14
Better than I expected!	When I started &quot;Birthright&quot; I was kind of skeptical of the nature of the novel.  Boy...was I surprised....not only was it fast-paced...it was interesting as well.  Though quite long for a NR book...it was well worth the time spent to get to the finish.	2003-09-07
I love Susan Andersen!!!	\\"Head Over Heels\\" was just what i was looking for in a quick read.....Susan Andersen has a knack for creating a book with romance and suspense all woven together to create one perfect book!	2003-08-31
Rachel does it again!	&quot;It must be love&quot; didn't disappoint me in the least.  When Joe tries to arrest Gabrielle everything gets hotter.  Gabe won't give in and Joe won't give up...but the ending is well worth the wait!	2003-08-23
Rachel Gibson is the BEST!!!!	I truly loved &quot;True Confessions.&quot;  Rachel has a knack for providing the best in a book.  Hope Spencer arrives in Gospel to do some relaxing work until she meets up with Dylan Taber.  Sparks fly and neither one comes out unscathed.  This book was excellent!	2003-08-23
A quick, uncomplicated read	&quot;Not Even For Love..&quot; was truly a throw-back 80's romance novel.  Though it lacks in Sandra's usual in-depth character potrayals..it was a nice, quick Sunday read.  Outcome is predicatable, so if you aren't into quick romance reads, you may want to check out some of her newest offerings.	2003-08-03
Nice light summer reading!!!!	Engaging men seemed to be the story of my life...a good man, a great man...and a bunch of women who throw it all together.  Angie reminded me so much of myself it wasn't even funny!  She has 2 men...one who loves her and one who THINKS he loves her.......thank god she finally came to her senses and ended up with the right one.	2003-07-28
A quick but far-fetched read!!!	Johnny Angel is one of those books you can read in one sitting......quite the good read.....definitely a bit far-fetched, but good nonetheless.  The end was not what i was expecting and some excerpts were repeated over and over....which happens alot in most DS books.I was truly delighted with Bobby's progree.. i would recommend this book to any die-hard DS fan.	2003-07-19
Absolutely Superb!!!!!	I've read all of Keye's books...except for \\"Lucy Sullivan\\" and this is by far the best yet.  I really had to dislike Lisa.... but Ashling and Clodaugh totally made the book the superb read it was....neither was flashy or gorgeous...but managed to keep both feet on the ground.  I also got a kick out of Trix.  I anxiously await Keye's next book!	2003-06-30
Kept me up at night trying to finish!!!!	\\"Behaving....\\" was excellent!  I truly enjoy Maxted's writing style.  This book was hard to put down...i kept reading page after page to see what Holly would stumble into next.  Issy and Claw...her sisters, added the extra spark to keep my attention.  I hope to see another Maxted novel in the near future!	2003-06-30
Not her normal style...but good anyway!!!	While Full Tilt may not be Janet's normal writing style...i did find delight in the book overall.  I especially liked the sparks between Jamie and Max.....and Beenie and Deedee were a pair from hell.  Janet kept this book moving at a good pace and it didnt lag for adventure.  I eagerly await her next installment of this series...as well as her new Stephanie Plum book.	2003-05-24
Refreshing and different!!!!	Wildwood was one of those books you can get into and really identify with the characters. I especially enjoyed Hannah and her fight to bond with Angel. All characters were brought to life and you felt like you really knew them.	2003-05-24
Finally.....not the same old book!	After reading all of DS books....I finally happened upon one that DOESNT sound just like all the rest of them.  Yes - Paris' husband leaves and yes- she tries to pick up the pieces, but this book not only had a dramatic ending, it didnt leave me bored halfway through. The twist on the plot was refreshing, and the addition of Paris' children kept it moving at a good pace.	2003-03-26
A great quick read	Lest we not forget...this was an early effort of Ms. Roberts, therefore....not her best character profiles.  Nontheless...i enjoyed all the characters, especially Sarah, Hunter's daughter.  Nora has come very far since she wrote these 2 books.  True...some of her newer efforts, including 3 Sisters Trilogy have been greatly improved.  I recommend these 2 books. I will next be diving into Time and Again.	2002-12-28
A little different than the norm....	As a huge fan of DS...i must say this book was NOT her usual repetitive writing.  I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who is a diehard DS fan.	2002-12-28
This woman can write a book!!!!	I truly enjoyed Fannie's latest effort..\\"Standing in the......\\" her style is unlike any other and it is so refreshing to see someone write a book others can relate to.  I especially liked Neighbor Dorothy and Betty Raye. I just wish Fannie could write faster, although her writing keeps me up WAY past my bedtime.	2002-09-05
Uh, has Jennifer Crusie left the building or WHAT?????	\\"Faking It\\" was not at ALL Jennifer's style and I don't think that I liked it so much. This seemed too \\"detective\\" style for my taste.....While I did enjoy the Goodnights....I didn't like all the male intrusions in the book.  Hopefully Jennifer will come up with something in her old style next time around.	2002-08-14
Well......I can't say I loved it....	\\"Hard Eight\\" was fine.  It wasnt the greatest, as a matter of fact, it was my LEAST favorite of the series.  I agree with the reviewer who said that she wanted more Ranger and Joe and less Valerie and her kids.  I truly enjoy all the shenanigans of Grandma Mazur...and even she was missing through most of the book.  I didn't find myself laughing aloud quite as much as I'd have liked to.  I think Janet should incorporate more of Steph's romantic life in her next book and kill off all bears, rabbits, etc.	2002-07-11
This was one of her better books.	&quot;The Cottage&quot; was a very good book....I enjoyed it alot.  I especially enjoyed the characters and the interactions with the families.  Danielle has done an excellent job and I look forward to reading &quot;Sunset in St. Tropez.&quot;	2002-07-11
Not the best I've ever read	&quot;Pretty is....&quot; was pretty decent.  I picked it up simply because the girl was from &quot;Palmyra.&quot;  I can honestly say...some of those people in the book really got on my nerves.  But.....Lucy reaped what she sowed and they all went down because of it.	2002-04-22
ICK......I couldn't even get  half-way through it!!!!	&quot;Black House&quot; was a screwball interpretation of something I have no clue about.  I just could not get into the book....maybe i needed to read &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series first.  Lately, however, King's books have been tedious to read....I didn't even finish the part where the boy was taken...i just couldn't stay interested.  I hope King goes back to his writing of days gone by......Cujo, Pet Semetary, etc......books that were worthy of his name!!!!!	2001-10-23
I love this woman!!!!!	I think Ave Maria is my hero!!!!!!  I just love the woman and her daughter, Etta.  Jack Mac's not too shabby, either.  I am truly interested in reading the next installment because I want to see what happens with Pearl and her doctor.  Ave Maria makes me long to go to Italy and run to the discos!!!!!	2001-10-17
What a great book!!	To say I liked this book would be an understatement, for sure!  I positively LOVED Ave Maria and thought Jack Mac was pretty spectacular, too!  I loved Ave's approach to the whole Pearl situation and feel Pearl deserved what she got.  I can hardly wait to read \\"Big Cherry Holler!\\"	2001-09-17
PRETTY DARN GOOD!!!!	I was pretty disappointed in &quot;Envy&quot; when I first started to read it. The first few chapters seemed to drag, save for the installments of Parker's &quot;book.&quot; But once it got rolling and we were introduced to Maris and Parker's relationship...it all changed. I really enjoyed this book, as I do most of Sandra's books.	2001-09-14
Not Bad....not great!!!!!	&quot;Running in Heels&quot; wasn't all that bad. It dragged on a bit...Natalie was a self-focused young twit. I found myself wandering away from it for days on end....seemed as though her first book was much more interesting to me. I will read her next book...improvement comes with practice.	2001-09-05
P.S.........I LIKED it!!!!!	I can't say I loved this book....I didn't.....but I really liked it.  The concept of F. Scott and Sctt was cool but different and really far-fetched in my eyes.  I really like Louise...Missy...however.... was the kind of person I'd love to stomp on!!!!!	2001-08-21
What a wonderful book!!!!	I truly loved this book!!!!!  I read it in 2 days and I must say...Alice Hoffman is truly gifted.  I loved Kat and Collie and have to wonder if Alice Hoffman is an animal lover!!!!  What happpened to Ethan was unfortunate...however...he did make his bed...so now he has to lie in it.	2001-08-06
I think this needed to be a bit more developed!!!!	&quot;The Things I...&quot;  was a pretty decent read.  I do feel, however that the character development was not very thorough!!!!  I did enjoy Tessa and Liddy...I just wish I knew a bit more about them.	2001-08-06
Very weird......but I liked it!!!!!	&quot;High Maintenance&quot; was ok.  Andrew was a total psychopath and I only wish that Liv had seen that from day one.  I had to laugh at Dale....what a trip....and soooooo honest.  Liv was a bit messed up from the start and never did quite find her place....but all-in-all I think it was a pretty good read.  I'm going to dig into &quot;Going Down&quot; next!!!!	2001-07-30
This one was definitely a winner!	Short novels are my thing....and this one did not disappoint! \\"Born to be Wild\\" was a perfect blend of love and heartache.  Lauren and Max are two totally different people from different sides of the tracks.  She's a high and mighty socialite......and he's a rough and tumble caterer who rides a Harley. And when they get together...look out. Add two foster kids to the picture and you've got one terrific mess.  And it gets better with every page!	2001-07-25
Jane Green has a knack for novels!!!!	&quot;Mr. Maybe was wonderful....or is excellent the word????  Libby is looking for love in all the wrong places.....and almost finds it.  Nick was everything she was looking for...except he has no job.  Ed...on the other hand....has lots of money but no sex appeal.  Can a new-age woman find true happiness with an old-fashioned guy?????  Afraid not!!!!!!  Every woman deserves a Nick in her life at least once.	2001-07-25
I think this was one of her best!!!!	&quot;Dance Upon the Air&quot; was spectacular.  I had the greatest time reading about Nell, Mia, Lulu and especially Ripley...with her uncanny sense about her hidden &quot;talents.&quot; Zack was a perfect helping of &quot;man&quot; for Nell's cooking and as for the no-good man she called a husband..well...Zack gives him what he's got coming to him!!!!	2001-07-16
I cringed to imagine this plot in today's society!!!!	While I did somewhat enjoy &quot;Seduction By Design,&quot; something caught my attention and prompted me to look at the copyright date in the front of this book.  To my surprise, it was 1983.  Then the whole book made more sense to me.  As far as Hailey and Tyler were concerned....welll......I think it was pretty trashy the way he demanded that she be his &quot;woman.&quot;  GAG!!!!!!!  If I hear a line like that today directed towards me..that man had better watch his step.  I love SB and will continue to read her books...but this one was a shot in the dark!!!	2001-07-16
I wonder if she wrote this or not!!!!	I am a big fan of JC.  VERY big.  I have read all of her books and she never fails to amaze me.  I especially like how she writes solely about California folks and not your everyday hillbilly.  This book was not as up to par as some of her others.....although I did really like Lissa and Nicci and Brian.  I will never fail to pick up another JC novel in the future!!!	2001-07-11
Well.......it's Stephanie...after all!!!!	&quot;Seven Up&quot; was another predictable installment in the &quot;Plum&quot; series.  I must admit:  Grandma Mazur will always be tops on my list...as will Morelli and Lula.  Stephanie..well...she's a mess.  Her sister Valerie needs to take her kids and VANISH before the whole town of Trenton goes under.  As far as Ranger...well...it would take alot for me to break down and pursue him. I think I'd stick to Morelli, personally. I am sooo anxious to read the next book.	2001-07-06
Well......I didn't finish it...but I think it's a 1	I couldn't even bring myself to concentrate on &quot;Lip Service.&quot;  The characters were not developed well and the circumstances surrounding their meeting were strange.  I just didn't get into this book as much as I wished I could have.	2001-07-06
What a wonderful story!!!!	I took &quot;Summer Island&quot; along to the beach with me and finished by the pool.  What a wonderful story!!!!!  Although I do agree that the Dean and Ruby story was not fully developed..I did enjoy the renewal of the Nora/Ruby relationship.  I loved how Nora doted on Eric...especially since his owm mother abandoned him at such an early age.  I love Kristin Hannah's books and intend to read them all.	2001-07-03
Jennifer Crusie does it best!!!	&quot;Manhunting&quot; was  just a bit of a book.  I must say...I enjoyed every single last page of it.   Kate is so uptight and Jake was so laid back it was almost too funny to imagine.  I knew Kate was pretty much done once she ended up in the boat fishing with Jake. I really liked Jessie and Nancy, also.  Kate's final decision in the end was a good one....although...why do these books always have the same happy ending?????	2001-06-19
what a great debut book!!!	&quot;Good in Bed&quot; was a great read.  It's one of those books that leaves a bit to the imagination...which is a good thing in this day and age of countless novels and beach reads.  Cannie was one of the strongest female roles I've ever encountered in my book travels.  Bruce was a loser...plain and simple.  I am mighty thankful for Dr. K and Sam adds a bit of goodness to the whole thing.  I cannot wait for another Jenifer Weiner book.	2001-06-12
Pretty Decent debut novel	&quot;As Long As...&quot; was pretty decent for a first time writer.  I did get lost a time or two and was ready to beat Dawn into the ground once or twice, but it was a pretty decent read.  I'm glad the ending turned out as it did.	2001-06-05
Good....... but not as good as her others	When I heard &quot;Fast Women&quot; was coming out in May, I raced to the library to reserve it.  I could hardly wait to read it.  But...much to my disappointment...the book had alot less appeal than her previous works.  While I really enjoyed Nell, Suze and Margie...I sure could have done without Gabe and Riley and their daily business dealings.  I think if this book would have been written primarily about the &quot;girls&quot; it would have been much more engrossing for me.  I especially adored Marlene...bless her heart!!!!  I will read Ms. Crusie's next title.  I just purchased &quot;Manhunting&quot; and do believe I'll enjoy it alot.	2001-05-30
What a great book!!!	\\"All Shook Up\\" was right up my alley as far as fun books go.  Drucilla and J.D. swore they had no attraction to each other.  Boy...were they wrong.  Put Tate and Ben and even Sophie into the picture and J.D. was doomed from the start.  I especially loved when Char and Kev decided to end their long-standing rift.	2001-05-22
This book was terrific!!!	&quot;Angel Falls&quot; was one of those stories that simply holds your attention until the end. I felt so sorry for Liam when he discovered &quot;Mike's&quot; secret.  She really should have been honest with him in the first place.  And I felt even more sorry for Jacey and Brett.  Brett had to grow up very fast after Mike's accident.  I'm glad the book ended as it did....  ....	2001-05-16
i love Sandra Brown and this one was no exception!!!!	This book was short and sweet.  I tended to feel like smacking Dani and Logan a few times to put some sense into them.  I, too, have been in a similar situation and know how hard it is to let go.  I'm glad the ending happened as it did.......predictably...of course!!!!	2001-05-09
This book was not as good as some of her others	It took me a few days to read this book which was very unusual for a Jane Heller book.  This book was good but I definitely prefer &quot;Sis Boom Bah&quot; and &quot;Name Dropping&quot; instead.  Lynn was a real go-getter in this story.  I feel bad for what Penny put her through but she comes out on top anyway.  I am looking forward to more Jane Heller reads in the future.	2001-05-02
I was surprised how much i enjoyed it!!!!	I was a bit skeptical of &quot;Lone Eagle&quot; when i picked it up. I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  I didn't want to suffer through another version of &quot;No Greater Love.&quot;  I am not one for books written in the past instead of the present, but this book was extremely good and kept my attention for hours at a time.  Kate was extremely loyal to Joe and I can identify with her in most instances.  She never gave up hope and her dreams came true.  I highly recommend this book to all DS fans.	2001-04-24
This book was confusing!!!!	I can't say that I didn't like &quot;Jimmy&quot;s Girl.&quot;  I did like it for the most part...but.....I didn't like the fact that I had to read the same thing 2 chapters in a row.  Hearing it once is good enough for me.	2001-04-10
This book was another gem in the  Stanislaski series!!!!	&quot;Considering Kate&quot; was great.  I loved all the books in this series and I think this one may be my favorite.  The reason behind that may be the fact that Kate goes after Brody instead of vice-versa.  Most of the stories Nora writes have the main character being pursued by some love-sick man.  This one was a stroke of genius for sure.  I loved Jack and thought it was extremely cute how he asked Kate to &quot;marry&quot; him.  I can hardly wait for the next installment due in July.	2001-03-27
This is the best of the Night Tales stories!!!!!	&quot;Nightshade&quot; was the best of the four stories offered in &quot;Night Tales.&quot;  Thea and Colt were interesting enough as partners and as lovers.  I hope to see more about them in future installments of the &quot;Night&quot; series.	2001-03-20
Wow...these brothers are hot!!!!!!	&quot;The Stanislaski Brothers&quot; is a wonderful book.  I read &quot;Convincing Alex&quot; about 2 yrs. ago and loved it.  Bu t...I have to agree with the reviewer who said that &quot;Luring a Lady&quot; is better.  Mikhail was strong-willed and stubborn and his love interest...Sydney, was cold as ice.   Reminds me alot of myself.   This family is definitely one I'd love to meet.  Such a close-knit family with plenty of kids to liven things up.	2001-03-16
What a great book!!!!!	I really enjoyed &quot;Girl Talk.&quot;  However...I did find it hard to keep up with the author because she was constantly changing the time frame of the story.  Don't get me wrong....I did like this book alot...especially Ruby and Jacko.  Lissy and Church are a couple of goofs at age 15 and Piper was a brat.  I wish this book was longer to let the reader find out about the birth of Lissy's child.  I do hope that she and Church make it...and I certainly hope for a sequel!!!!	2001-03-12
This was  not one of my favorites!!!!	I like Nora Roberts ALOT.....she's one of my favorites...but this book didn't even make the cut for a good book.  I'd say it was a decent read...but not up to snuff with her other more recent books.  I guess when they say you get better with age is true!!!!  Aurora is not a normal 28 yr. old women.  She dabbles in the paranormal behavior....as does her mother, Clarissa.....and fights tooth and nail to keep herself away from David Brady.  Needless to say....this was not a great read.	2001-03-01
Deborah and Nemesis are the best!!!!!	When Deborah O'Roarke encounters trouble...she usually also encounters Nemesis.  After she starts seeing rich man Gage, Deborah still seems to run into Nemesis, until Gage reveals the shocking truth.  She is then torn between what she feels and what she knows.  I do believe that this book was better than Nightshift.  I am going to embark on the Nightshade and Nightsmoke books next.	2001-02-22
A tempting and delightful book!!!!	At first I didn't know what to make of &quot;Wish You Well.&quot;  I felt bad for OZ and Lou, but didn't know what the life w/ their great-grandma would bring.  I was surprised and delighted by the whole story.  I especially missed the antics of Diamond Skinner.  He seemed to be the meat in the sandwich.  I was happy for the two kids at the end.....Everything wasn't coming up roses.... but it wasn't all bad.	2001-02-21
This was a take-it or leave-it book!!!	Don't get me wrong...I love Steve Martin.  &quot;Shopgirl&quot;...well...I won't say I love it because it would be lying.  I found it to be an average read.  I'm an avid fiction reader and have spent many worthwhile hours reading tasty tidbits.  This wasn't a Hostess Twinkie by any means.....more so a little  extra cheese on your burger.  Mirabelle was an underdeveloped wallflower and her beau, Ray was a sloth.  Jeremy was the only person in this book to spark any interest on my part.	2001-02-15
By far.....one of the best Olivia Goldsmith reads yet!!!!!	&quot;Bad Boy&quot; seemed to be a slow read when I first started out.  Wow.....I read it in under 3 days!!!!!  Tracie knew what she wanted....she just didn't see it right in front of her face.  Her loser boyfriend, Phil and her best friend, Laura weren't of much help to her at all.  Jon is at the hands of fate with  Tracie.......until she creates a monster and has to knock him down a few pegs.   And.....lo and behold....loser Phil tries to make a turnaround a day late and a dollar short.  Tracie is torn between her job, her man, and her  soon-to-be exfriend, Jon.  I laughed so hard at some places that I almost fell off my couch!!!!  This book was soooo great.....maybe Olivia could write a sequel called...&quot;Bad Girl!&quot;	2001-02-13
Lukewarm romance for two stubborn lovers	&quot;Riley in the Morning&quot; is not necessarily a BAD book...but Sandra Brown has done soooo much better in her other romance novels.  Sure...this book is a quick read and may hold one's attention for a bit....but it lacks alot of the emotion from some of her other releases.  Riley was stubborn and somewhat selfish and so was Brin.  It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth as far as endings.  I will continue to read all of Sandra's books in the future because she has alot of talent.	2001-02-10
Easy to read and creepy at the same time!!!!	As anyone can tell you...being threatened or stalked is creepy...very much so!!!  &quot;Night Shift&quot; showed all the aspects of being threatened plus an added bonus: romance.  Of course Nora Roberts put in a little romance for her romance fans along with the suspense for her J.D. Robb fans.  I just wish I had a cute cop like Boyd Fletcher in my life!!!!!  Although... I have no reason to need protection!	2001-01-30
This book was enjoyable but confusing!!!!!	I read &quot;Off Keck Road&quot; in 2 days.  The characters of June and Bea were likable enough but Shelley was perhaps my favorite..  I had a bit of trouble keeping the characters straight at some point, but it was an enjoyable book nonetheless.  The relationship between Shelley and Bill baffled me and Bill kind of annoyed me in the fact that he tried to date Bea, June, and Shelley  throughout his 70 yrs. of life.  Kind of strange for a man who was married and had a bunch of kids.  Bill seemed to be the thrill of the three main female characters in this book.  I can perhaps see a vision of him...but the big picture cannot be seen through my eyes at all. I would recommend this to a friend.	2000-12-14
Very unique and interesting!	&quot;Feeding Christine&quot; was very different than my normal book picks.  I found it kind of hard to follow and identify with the characters.  Theresa was the hardest nut to crack.  Christine wasn't all that unstable as they made her out to be.  She just needed to get away from James and live her own life.  This book was good..don't get me wrong...but it was hard for me to follow.	2000-10-05
Must have been the suspense that kept me reading!!!!	&quot;Name Dropping&quot; was good.  Nancy Stern and her nemesis Nancy Stern both live in the same building.  A surprise Christmas gift sends the unpopular Nancy Stern into a threatening situation.  Her boyfriend is hiding a secret job and the other Nancy Stern is killed.  This book is not your typical fiction and I do believe that is what kept me so interested.	2000-09-26
I think Romance is better!!!!	&quot;The Switch&quot; was passive.  I prefer romance written by Sandra  Brown a whole lot better.  This book started out ok but mid-way through  became extremely tedious for me to read.  It was not until the end that  things really picked up.  I guess I'm just used to SB romance novels and  cannot get into these mystery books.  I agree with the reviewer from  MO....I'll stick to romance.	2000-09-18
Excellent Summer reading!	&quot;Julie and Romeo&quot; was excellent.  Just the right blend of love and humor to keep me amused.  Julie Roseman was a divorced mother with her  feet on the ground until Romeo Cacciamani comes floating into her life.  At  the threat of being disowned by their families, the two weather the snide  remarks, fistfights and business battles.  I have to say that Plummy was my  favorite person in this book.	2000-08-11
How Peculiar!	&quot;Trans-Sister Radio was very odd.  I'm not saying that Dana was odd for getting the operation, just that the whole book struck me as odd.  I  could not remember who was talking in each chapter, therefor I would have  to go back to the beginning to check.  Allison was purely STUPID to think  that she and Dana could just &quot;pick-up&quot; where they left off!    WRONG!   What made her think she would be happy with a female Dana minus a  penis?   She was not a lesbian. That was probably  her biggest attraction  to Dana in the first place.  Dana turned out to be mostly selfish and I'm  almost astonished at the fact that she decided she liked men after all.   The one I felt sorry for was Patricia.  She clearly lost out on a good man  when Will turned to Allison and Dana.	2000-08-09
Good as only Sandra can be!!!	&quot;In a Class....&quot; was your typical Sandra Brown romance.  Dani  and Logan have to overcome alot to be together .  To the reader who  wondered about mystery writer Sandra Brown....they are one and the same  person.  You need to be careful not to order her ROMANCE titles.	2000-08-03
Very good and very down-to-earth!!!!	&quot;Reap&quot; was a very interesting book.  Jessup seemed to fall into  the wrong hands with Reg and Marigold, thus learning a life lesson the hard  way.  Marigold was one tough cookie and her husband was a total waste.  If  he didn't want to work then he shouldn't be terrorizing other people who  do.  I admire Marigold's strength and perserverance.  She did the right  thing at the end of the book.  Jessup needed to open his eyes and see just  how bad his connection with Reg really was.  The fair scene hit too close  to home.  This book left me with a feeling of incompleteness.	2000-08-03
DS has done it this time!	&quot;The House on Hope Street&quot; was pretty good. Liz loses Jack in the blink of an eye and her whole life changes.  Then son Peter falls on bad luck and Liz's life is sent once again into a tailspin.  She fares  remarkably well through the tragedy and manages to keep her head.  Her  children find it hard to accept a new man in their mother's life but Liz  makes peace and they all manage to make it through.  This book was better  than &quot;The Wedding.&quot;	2000-07-31
I couldn't even finish it.....	&quot;Fiona Range&quot; was tedious to read, to say the least!   I tired very quickly of all the &quot;scrapping&quot; going on with her and her family and the problems at the Cafe.  This plot was boring and not enough  to keep me interested.  I may pick up another MMM book in years to come,  and hopefully will find it much more entertaining!	2000-07-27
Jackie never fails to amuse me....	&quot;Lethal Seduction was a great read.  Jackie never fails to keep me amused with her plots.  I will say that Rosarita is a twit and her husband needs to 'bone-up' on his people skills.  I felt bad for Madison, however,  with JC plots, these men are always abundant.  I wished she had thrown in a  bit of Lucky for us in this novel, but all-in-all it was a good read!    Keep 'em comin', Jackie!	2000-07-24
Excellent!	&quot;Jemima J&quot; was excellent!   So excellent in fact, that I read it in 2 days.  Ok, so the top reviewer was right:  Single women should NOT go meet a total stranger.  But, HELLO, this is FICTION here!   I just  adored Geraldine and Ben.  Jemima did the right thing about never  forgetting Ben and I myself am a firm believer in &quot;good things come to  those who wait! &quot;  And, if JJ lost all that weight and felt better  about herself than that's a good thing.  We're not saying she had no  friends because she was fat.  She had low self-esteem.	2000-07-24
Temptation is THE place to be!	&quot;Welcome To Temptation&quot; was pretty cool.  I seem to like Sophie the best, with Dillie in close second.  Some of this book was quite boring and it did take me pretty long to read it.  I think I liked Jennifer's  other two books better than this one.	2000-07-18
Much Better than &quot;The Wedding!&quot;	&quot;The House on Hope street&quot; was soooo much more entertaining than  &quot;The Wedding.&quot;  DS found her true niche in this story.  Liz and  Jack have the perfect business, perfect marriage and great kids until a  Christmas tragedy changes everything.  Liz copes by throwing herself into  her work and kids.  Until a second tragedy hits.  Liz is almost at the end  of her rope until Dr. Bill Webster helps her cope.  Life isn't easy for the  two, but they somehow weather the storm and all works out for the best.	2000-07-10
I can't even say I read it........	&quot;Sex and Shopping......&quot; leaves a lot to be desired!   I love Judith Krantz fiction but....this one was too down-to-earth and real for me.  I could not get interested in this book no matter how hard I tried.   Judith, don't take this the wrong way but you need to stick with  FICTION!	2000-07-03
I can hardly wait for the next one!	&quot;Hot Six&quot; was great!   Stephanie and Grandma Mazur make a VERY swell pair!   Now that Joe Morelli finally realizes what's at stake he might take action in #7.  Steph's mom and grandma Mazur are favorites and  Mooner and Dougie are newcomers.  This book beats number &quot;High  Five&quot; by a long shot!   Read them all but........start with number  one so you know what's going on!	2000-06-28
Ok, but not the best!	&quot;One Heart&quot; was OK enough for me although I did not finish it.  The plot with Ivy and Gladys seemed OK but once James came into the picture all went amuck.  I just couldn't get into the rest of the book and mostly  just gave up.	2000-06-23
Very Entertaining and Insightful!	&quot;Ain't Nobody's....&quot; was a treat!   Eva was sure her life was perfect......until Hutch decides to leave her.  Hutch was acting like a total idiot and Eva was almost following suit. Until Isaiah comes along and  rocks her world.  Charley acts like a spoiled brat and her stepbrother  Stephen was mistreated by his father. This book held my attention very well  even at the pool with a million screaming kids.	2000-06-20
what a great book!	&quot;Joe&quot; was spectacular!   I felt at home with the characters immediately!   I especially felt sorry for Gary because of his selfish, good for nothing father Wade.  The poor kid tries to make a living and his  drunk father tries to spend it on himself.  His mother is crazy and his  little sister doesn't talk.  The best thing to happen to him was to meet  Joe.  Joe wasn't exactly role-model material but he was a far better person  than Gary's father.  I can hardly wait to read FAY to see what happens to  her.  Getting away from this situation was the best thing she ever did.   Read this book: You won't be disappointed.	2000-05-25
This book is a real treat!!!	&quot;Dating Big Bird&quot; was a real hoot to read.  Ellen is trying so  hard to fight the urge to have her own child after delighting in her niece  Nicole (aka &quot;the pickle&quot;).  Watching her sister and her boss go  through pregnancies has taken its toll and Ellen needs to make a decision  on her own since her man Malcolm can't commit.  The only thing I regret  about this book is the fact that Ellen doesn't give birth.  I would love a  sequel of this to hear the stories she would tell!!!!	2000-05-16
Couldn't even finish it!	&quot;A Map.....&quot; was sooooo boring I had to stop in the middle due to lack of interest!   Very uncommon for me to do, I usually give it my best shot to finish it. This, however, was not the case with this book!    Alice was a freak and her husband Howard was a negligent parent.  I may  pick this book up in years to come but I seriously doubt it!  I have read  a lot of books in my time and this has to be one of the worst!	2000-05-12
What a good book!	&quot;Secrets.....&quot; was hard for me to decipher at first.  I didn't know what to make of the flip-flop of years between Sidda and Vivi.  It was a bit hard to follow up until the middle.  Then the book really takes off.   All I can say is... I wish I had been with Necie, Caro, Teensy and Vivi the  night they hit the local water tower.  You go, girls!   I liked Rebecca  Wells style of writing so I think I will check out &quot;Little Alters  Everywhere.&quot;	2000-05-04
King at his best!	I read DESPERATION when it first came out. I felt it was one of King's best.  He invented a storyline which kept the reader entranced throughout the book.  I must say that I did like this one a bit better than &quot;THE REGULATORS&quot; but readers must realize that they should read this one  first for optimal pleasure.  This book is a bit slow at times but mostly  keeps a good pace throughout.  I recommend reading RIDING THE BULLET off of  this site!	2000-05-03
Some good, some bad, some the same-old-same-old!	I have been reading GLAMOUR for years and most of the secrets have popped up at one time or another.  I'm not saying that it's not great to have them all in one place, but most of this is old news.  I will use it and it's  pretty good.	2000-04-28
Out of the Blue was Out of this world!	&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was one of those books that just reaches out and grabs your heart.  Anna knew what her disease could mean to her and Joe and tried to keep from getting too close to him emotionally.  Joe, however  decide that Anna is what he wants and he will not go down without a fight.   Anna's mother Nora has a nasty mouth on her, but I liked the strong way  that she helps Anna.  This book is &quot;all that&quot; and more!	2000-04-27
Very good and very similar  to the movie!	&quot;Girl.....&quot; was good, although I must say the movie was 10 times better. Susanna analyzes herself a bit too much in the book.  I guess seeing the movie first was a mistake!   I expected the book to be the  same.  Some of the parts were similar but others made no sense.  I  especially was messed up because the movie was filmed where I live in Pa.   It was hard to imagine our State Hospital as her hospital in Mass.  All in  all, it was a good book.  Just read this BEFORE watching the movie!	2000-04-24
This book kept me up for a few nights!	&quot;The Wedding&quot; was classic DS material.  It started out VERY slllloooooowwwwwwwww and I had to wonder if I could ever finish it!   But wow, after Jeff and Allegra meet it really picks up.  I especially liked  the storyline of Samantha and her friend.  This book will be loved by all  true fans of DS.<br />Also try:  Some Things That Stay and Remembering Blue	2000-04-21
This is a &quot;Feel Good&quot; kind of book	&quot;Some Things.....&quot; was superb!   So rare is a book about teenagers so entertaining as this one.  Maybe it's the fact that it is set in the '50's.  Tamara is forced to look after her younger siblings while  her parents are absent.  This is no easy task, since Robert is a whiner and  Megan won't talk.  Needless to say, Tamara does a splendid job. I think I  will read it again soon.	2000-04-21

This book was wonderful!	I read &quot;Gap Creek&quot; over a month ago (...)  This bookwas great!   Julie learns a lot about being a wife really fast.She had to put up with WAY too much from her young husband.  The pig slaugtering was a bit too graphic, but hey, that's life.  Read this book and enjoy!	2000-04-17
Really good book!	&quot;Remembering Blue&quot; was a good book.  Mattie knew from the start that Nick Blue was meant for her.  Unfortunately, life sometimes doesn't go as planned.  Mattie and Nick had a great marriage, despite the fact that  she could not cook.  This book is very touching and I recommend it to  everyone who loves a great fiction read.	2000-04-08
Basic, typical Sandra Brown,  which is  a good thing!	&quot;Bittersweet Rain&quot; was another typical SB novel.  Not that that is a good thing or a bad thing either way.  Rink was gone for twelve long years after breaking Caroline's heart.  But things still aren't in the best  of shape, due to Roscoe's deteriorating condition.  This is the one thing  that brings Rink and Caroline together once again.  I like these books but  they all sound the the same after a while.	2000-04-07
In a word : WONDERFUL!	&quot;Fried Green...&quot; was a very wonderful book!   Fannie Flagg has the knack for creating characters that are not only entertaining, but different!   I loved this book from the start, especially Idgie for her  determination.Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode were wonderful, noshing on junk  food for lack of better things to do.  All of Fannie Flaggs books are  great!   I can hardly wait for a new one to come out!	2000-03-27
Sooooo hard to comprehend!	&quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;  was just not nearly as good as the first one.  I felt like I had to force myself to finish it.  I don't live in London so most of the dialogue was lost on me!   Bridget and Mark  were a disaster waiting to happen and Sharon was a schmuck!   As for  Mark and Rebecca: that was the only really funny part of the book!   I'd  say skip buying this one!	2000-03-22
A light and entertaining read!	&quot;The Ladies...&quot; was pretty good.  It had its good points and its bad points.  I was a bit shocked at how kosher Jewish people are, but after a while it sort of blended together.  Parts of this book were somewhat  boring, but all-in-all it was a good read.	2000-03-22
Very Good!	Even though I do like King's older works this book was very good!   I read the book before seeing the movie and Kathy Bates is perfect to play Dolores.  I can't blame her a bit for what she did to her husband.  This  book was perfect because it wasn't too long and wasn't too short.  If you  liked this read : ROSE MADDER, GERALD'S GAME and THE REGULATORS.	2000-03-17
I love King's books but this one was not his best.	&quot;Carrie&quot; the book is not as good as the movie.  I realize that this was his first novel, so I will cut him some slack!   I just adored the movie and Sissy Spacek was wonderful.  Carrie's mother and classmates  pushed her to the limit and she showed them who was boss!   Read all of  his books!	2000-03-17
This book is great!	In order to understand where King is coming from in GERALD'S GAME, you need to read Dolores Claiborne first.  True, this is not the old King, but it's very good!   Jessie puts up a hell of a fight to get free.  I like  all of King's books except THE STAND and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS.  If you like  this book try: ROSE MADDER, THE REGULATORS, and DOLORES CLAIBORNE.	2000-03-17
This was one of my first SK books and one of my favorites!	&quot;THE DEAD ZONE&quot; was spectacular!   After being hit by a milk tanker in his VW bug, Johnny is in a coma for  4 1/2 years.  But once he comes out of his coma a startling thing happens.  This book was very good  and made me think a lot about the supernatural.  I loved the movie with  Christopher Walken.  Read this-it's great!   If you like this you should  try: CUJO, FIRESTARTER, and CHRISTINE.	2000-03-17

Oprah picked a good selection this time!	&quot;Gap Creek&quot; was good.  I have only 2 complaints.  I really was sickened by the description of the child throwing up the worms.  I really  lost my appetite after that.  The other thing I found to be terrible was  the episode about the umbilical cord.  There are some things that are  better left unsaid.  The rest of the book was really good.  I'm soo glad I  was not born in Julie's time period!   She worked like a horse and Hank  acted like a baby.  I'm glad to see they came to terms with each other at  the end.	2000-03-16
Horribly boring and mundane	I have read alot of books in my 28 yrs, and I must say this has to be one of the most boring I've ever read.  Danny is a creep, Ria is a wimp and their kids seem to be rotten.  Not to mention the length of the book.  It took me FOREVER to finish it and I'm sorry to say that I may never pick up  another of Maeve Binchy's books.  Stick to good ones such as Plainsong or  Gap Creek!	2000-03-14
This book made me laugh and cry!	&quot;Patty Jane's....&quot; was excellent!  Nora grew up with her mother, aunt and paternal grandmother in a house with a beauty salon in the front.  For 14 yrs. her father was missing, but one day someone brings him back.  But her father was not the man that her mother married 15 yrs before.  Nora  needs to adjust to a sick family member and a father who has no idea who  his daughter is.  I cried so hard reading the last chapter that I had to  put the book down.  If you liked &quot;Talk Before Sleep,&quot; you will  LOVE this book!	2000-03-14
Light, fun and too short!	&quot;Playing Botticelli&quot; was a great read.  Dylan is a well-adjusted teenager who lives in Florida with her art-inspired mother, Godiva.  Dylan finds a picture of her &quot;missing&quot; father and decides to find him.   Godiva, none-the-wiser to Dylan's absence, finally realizes where her  daughter went.  After a long hard trip, Dylan returns to her mother.  This  book was wonderful.  I wish it was longer and I hope for a sequel.	2000-03-09
Really Good and Really Funny!	&quot;Watermelon&quot; is one of those &quot;feel good&quot; books.  Claire's husband James is being a real jerk so she and baby Kate leave London to go to Dublin to stay with their family. Claire finds living with  her parents and two younger sisters proves to be difficult after being on  her own.  Then Adam comes into the picture and Claire's whole life gets  turned upside down.  Adam has to be the best thing that ever could happen  to Claire.  This book is so good that I read it in 2 days.	2000-03-06
This Was Good But Not Great	&quot;Pay it Forward&quot; was a decent read.  It kept my attention enough to finish it in  2 days, however I feel the characters could have been more developed.  I especially would have liked a better portrayal of Arlene.   Her character was the best in the book.  I would recommend it to others.	2000-03-02
This book is a  riot!	At first I thought &quot;Young Wives&quot; was boring and slow.  I was wrong!   After the first half of the book, Jada and Michelle meet Angela and their lives really take on a new twist!   I think Angela was the  saving point of this story.  Jada and Michelle are suddenly single women  with children and Angela has a problem of her own to deal with.  I think  Jada's decision regarding her children was a good move, however her drastic  measures to get them from Clinton was a bit much.  I would not recommend  doing what she did to the house.  As far as Michelle goes, she did some  foolish things herself to protect her kids. This book is a riot, so hang in  there through the first few chapters, and you'll find yourself in the  middle of a great read! <br />To the reader from Australia-  Here are some  great books to try ! <br />Handyman by Linda Nichols<br />Plainsong by Ken  Haruf<br />Bittersweet Rain by Sandra Brown<br />And, of course, anything from  Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel!	2000-02-28
So good you'll want to stay up to finish it!	&quot;Handyman&quot; was great!   Jake Cooper had no idea what he was getting into when he posed as Dr. Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Golding.  Maggie Ivey definitely had no idea what was going on until she is accused of  something horrible that isn't true.  Maggie and Jake show us that love can  conquer all.  I stayed up 2 nights in a row to finish this book.	2000-02-28

Great Book from a Great Author!	Judy Blume was always my favorite YA writer.  After reading Wifey and Forever, I didn't realize she had written Smart Women.  Boy, was this book great!   Classic '80's women, kids and houses!  I especially loved Sara  and Michelle.  Although from totally different worlds they came together to  form a family unit.  Some of B.B.'s hissy fits were a bit much, but this  book was great!	2000-02-25
This book deserves a 10!   Absolutely Wonderful!	&quot;Back Roads&quot; has to be one of the best books I ever read! (And I read a lot of books! )  Harley is thrown into manhood much too early in  this debut novel by Tawni O'Dell.  If losing his father too early by murder  wasn't hard  enough, he has to deal with raising his three younger sisters  after his mother goes to jail.  Each girl has her own distinctive  personality, and it's a wonder they didn't kill each other living in that  house together. Harley finds out the truth about his father's death and his  whole world goes downhill fast.  He falls for a young mother of two and  things start to go really wrong after his sister finds out about them.  Harley wonders about from day to day, drinking beer and not sleeping.  This  is a book you need to start on a Friday night so you can stay up all  weekend reading it!   I thought it was awesome and I eagerly await a  sequel or something else from Tawni.	2000-02-14
Plainsong is anything but &quot;plain!&quot;	&quot;Plainsong&quot; was a good book.  I especially felt connected with Victoria.  She just reached out a grabbed your heart.  Sure, she was 17 and pregnant, but she was mature and quiet.  The McPheron brothers were also  great.  They went from old, opinionated farmers to kindhearted guardians to  Victoria.  I was very into this book and I wish it had been a bit longer.  Well, maybe there will be a sequel!	2000-02-14

Nora always entertains!	&quot;The Last.....&quot; was simply divine!   Abby broke away from her show business family to raise her own on a farm.  Little did she know that Dylan would come along and disrupt her normal routine  in more ways than  one.  Ben and Chris were especially lovable and the story was cute and  cozy.  I can only hope that ALL the O'Hurley books are this good.	2000-01-21
This book is a great read for a cold night!	&quot;While I was Gone&quot; was wonderful.  The characters of Jo, Nora, Cass,Daniel and Sadie were wonderful.  I can say I didn't agree with Eli so much, if at all, but this book held my attention quite well.	2000-01-18
Much Better Than The Last Mini-series!	Being a huge fan of V.C. Andrews made me realize that she is not alive to write this material, therefore it is not going to be the same format as her own.  Misty was actually pretty good for a series book, although I did feel  weird sitting in public reading it after I saw it was ranked for 10  yr-olds!  I think I read Flowers in the Attic when I was 14.  Quite a big  difference in the text.  I am anxious to start STAR.	2000-01-04
This book was really good!	Although I did not read the first book to this sequel, I really enjoyed this book.  I felt sorry for Eve.  She was trying to be strong and ended up winning in the end.  I am not a fan of murder/romance books, but this one  was a winner!	1999-12-30
Definitely different!	&quot;Tara Road&quot; started out soooo slow and boring that I wondered if I'd be able to finish it at all.  The one thing that saved the book was the house switching of Ria and Marilyn.  Marilyn seemed to bring something good  to the house and saw Danny for what he was: a snake.  For the reviewer who  wondered who was with Rosemary the day Annie spotted them?  Her father,  most likely.  Seemed like Danny slept with anything with legs!  OK book, I  might read another of hers eventually.	1999-11-30
Wow!  As good as Where The Heart Is!	I give Oprah a thumbs-up for this pick!   &quot;White Oleander&quot; was absolutely wonderful!   I read it in 3 days!  Astrid is an innocent child who turns in to a hard-edged woman, due to her bad experiences in foster  care.  Her mother, Ingrid is someone whom I'd love to strangle.  She's the  epitome of a neurotic mother.  This book was sooo great, I'd recommend it  to everyone!	1999-11-17
It was good but not as great as I'd hoped!	&quot;Irresistible Forces&quot; was an easy read.  I felt, however, that it was written in a mundane form.  We really didn't need to know every move that Cal and Merrie made in their travels.  It seemed like the writing was  a bit childish.  Don't get me wrong, the book was OK for the most part, but  not as good as some of her others.	1999-11-17
Entertaining yet a bit TOO over-the-top!!!	&quot;Black Satin&quot; was, for the most part pretty good.  I did not, however, like the petty attitudes of some of the men, and the explicit description of Carla and Ronnie having sex.  That part was geared more  towards a male's perspective.  All-in-all it was a decent read, I just wish  I hadn't paid so much for it.	1999-11-02
Bridget Jones she is NOT!!!!!!!!	&quot;The Cigarette Girl&quot; was none too appealing to me at all.  I was expecting a Bridget Jones type story and got some hard-to-follow mishmash.   Elizabeth was a picky, sex-starved female who could not make up her mind.   I'd say, folks, wait for the paperback version to come around!	1999-10-28
My first LGS book, and not my last!!!!!!	&quot;Private Acts&quot; started out a bit slow and was VERY hard to follow, but as time and pages wore on, I decided I really liked the plot. Alexis was a high-power partner on Wall Street, her husband Nico, was a  store owner.  They have a little rift and separate.  Nico decides to make a  play for Maggie, his best friend Sy's wife.  Maggie is amazed by the effect  Nico has over her.  Read the rest of the book and find out who comes out  the winner!!!!	1999-10-20
Very emotional and tender	&quot;Range of Motion&quot; was my fourth EB book.  I loved it just as much as the three previous ones.  Lainey keeps herself from falling apart when her husband is in a coma.  Her children make it very hard for her to keep it together.  Elizabeth Berg is a spectacular writer, and I plan to  read more!	1999-10-12
All of her books are good, but this was super!!1	&quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; has to be one of the best books I've ever read!!!  Anyone who has lost someone to cancer knows that it's a long, painful battle.  Ruth tried to make her last days as painless and fun as possible.  She never lost her humor and wanted to die peacefully. Ann, her  closest friend, doesn't see things quite the same.	1999-10-12
Nora never disappoints!!!!	The Calhoun Women.. &quot;Catherine and Amanda&quot; is the first 2 part book about 4 sisters.  In this book, Catherine &quot;C.C.&quot; meets Trent, and Amanda meets Sloan.  I give Nora credit for making up original  names for her male characters.  These Calhoun sisters will win your  heart!!!  C.C., with her black hair, is an auto mechanic, Amanda, with her  honey brown hair, is a hotel manager, Lilah, with her flame red mane is a  naturalist, and Suzanna is the blonde with the children.	1999-10-04
Stephen King is the best!!!!!!	&quot;Hearts&quot; was a good book!!!!  &quot;Low Men  In....&quot; was really good with Bobby, Carol, and Ted.  The &quot;Hearts&quot; story was long and boring, but &quot;Blind Willie&quot; was great.  &quot;Why  We're....&quot; was another dragged out story, but all-in-all this was a  good book!!!!!!  Keep 'em coming, King!!!!!	1999-10-01
So boring I could hardly wait to get it done!!!	In all of my years of reading Sandra Brown books, I have never come across one that was below  four-stars until now.  &quot;The Alibi&quot; was very boring and I found myself skipping paragraphs and hoping the next page  would prove fruitful.  All I can say is that Sandra Brown should stick to  steamy romance novels and do us all a BIG favor!!!!	1999-09-28
One of King's Best!!!!!!!	I'm not a fan of short stories but..... &quot;Hearts&quot; was definitely a winner!!!!!  I especially liked the story of Bobby and Ted and Blind Willie was awesome, too!  The other stories weren't as good, but held my  attention enough to fininsh the book in 5 days.  Go buy this book; you  won't regret it!!!!	1999-09-21
Shane's story was the best!!!!	&quot;The Fall of....&quot; was the best of the 4 Mackade series!!!  I wish a man like Shane was around to sweep ME off my feet!!!  Rebecca aka &quot;Becky&quot; to Shane was always a brainy nerd.  WAS a nerd.  Shane is  absolutely smitten with her and they end up falling hard.  This was the  best followed by Devin, Jared, then Rafe.  Nora has an exceptional talent  for writing books in a series.  Next I'm going to tackle the O'Hurleys!!!!	1999-09-08
All those Mackades need to live in my town!!	&quot;The Pride of....&quot; was once again, a great book.  These brothers have to be the best!!  Nora Roberts hit home with this series!!!!  Jared Mackade was married to a cool woman, until he decided she wasn't his type.   Along comes Savanna Morningstar and her son, Bryan.  Savannah soon shows  Jared what type of woman he really likes.  I have to say this one was my  third favorite.  Shane's story was the best!!!!	1999-09-08
Great Book!!	&quot;Thumbelina&quot; was a bit hard to get used to at first but look out!!!!  After her mother dies when she is fourteen, Thumbelina learns fast what it's like to be in the real world.  <br />This review slot is for the  book by Andrea Koenig, not the &quot;Children's&quot; version with  pictures!!!!!	1999-09-08
Judy Blume NEVER wrote a bad book!!!!	&quot;Wifey&quot; was my first take on adult fiction.  I loved it sooo much I had to buy another copy after my friends all were finished reading it.  Great book, but read it BEFORE &quot;Summer Sisters.&quot;	1999-09-02
Yum!!!!!! I love those MacKades!!!!	&quot;The Heart of...... was just wonderful! As a matter of fact, I like this one even better than &quot;Rafe.&quot;  Cassie Dolin and Devin Mackade were meant to be together.  Joe Dolin, Cassie's ex will do everything in  his power to prevent that from happening.  Find out who wins the girl in  this 3rd installment of the MacKades.	1999-09-02
Oh how I love those Mackade brothers.	&quot;The Return of... was terrific!!  What better way to spark interest than to write about gorgeous men!!!  Rafe was all that and then some!!  Regan was cool to a point, but she had her moments and rafe deserved  everything he got, including her!!!	1999-08-30
Not as good as the rest of the MacGregors.	&quot;Rebellion&quot; was a historical romance and since historical books are my least favorite, I gave it a 3.  I read it because I love the MacGregor series and felt that I shouldn't miss any.  To the reviewer from  So. California:  If you check the front of &quot;MacGregor Brides&quot; it  should give you a chart of the family tree along with sequence of most of  the books.  Hope this helps!!!!	1999-08-23
Nora Roberts is a reader's dream!!!	&quot;Brazen Virtue&quot; was a great &quot;love-mystery&quot; mini-novel.  I am used to reading Nora's romance stories, so this one threw me a bit.  It was  wonderful nonetheless. The sister of a murder victim helps her next  door neighbor catch the criminal.  I give it a thumb's up!!!!!<br />Also, try  the Mackade Brothers' series.	1999-08-23
Not as good as I had hoped, but bearable!!!	&quot;Mother of Pearl&quot; was not all that easy to read.  I did love the characters of Valuable and Jackson.  The rest of 'em, with the exception of Neva, really didn't grab my attention.  All I can say is, Melinda, if you  write another book, take up with Billie Letts or Fannie Flagg before you  do!	1999-08-20
Elizabeth Berg is wonderful!!!	I Read &quot;Durable Goods&quot; and loved it so much I knew I had to read the sequel &quot;Joy School.&quot;  Katie is just wonderful and reminds me of myself at that age.  I too was infatuated with a guy who was 10 years  older.  Nothing became of it, of course, but it was a good learning  experience.  Katie's friend Taylor is a trip and I loved her tricks and  wildness.  Elizabeth Berg you are terrific!!!	1999-08-18
Very good and very weird!!!!	The only reason I give &quot;Hannibal&quot; a four instead of a five is because I did not like the part about Hannibal in Italy.  It was too boring and I found myself craving Starling in her 5.0 Mustang.  I agree with the  reviewer who said the ending was a bit far-fetched.  I can hardly wait to  see this as a movie.	1999-08-16
short, sweet and non-binding.	&quot;The Girls' Guide To.....was a cute book.  I'll admit it's hard to follow most of it but if you don't like deep reading, it's great.  Jane a.k.a. Janie has a bit of growing to do and the characters in the book are  doing their best to help her. I think I like Archie the best of all the  characters.  This book is somewhat along the lines of &quot;Local  Girls.&quot;	1999-08-03
A short, sweet book on life.	&quot;Local Girls&quot; was my 1st Alice Hoffman book and it was not disappointing!!!!  Gretel and her friend Jill are typical teenagers with not-so-typical families.  This book was short and sweet, and I read it in 3  hours.  I will surely read more of Ms. Hoffman's books in the near future.   She has a great way with words and makes you feel like you know the  characters.	1999-07-26
I just can't get into this one like I did w/the others.	&quot;High Five&quot; may be an OK read, but I can't seem to get into it.  I'm almost halfway through it and it's not really holding my interest.  And, Janet, if you read this, I think you should know: '53 Buicks do NOT  have seatbelts or E-brakes that pull up!!!!! Stephanie is NOT driving a  'Vette!!  Hopefully I will make it through this one.	1999-07-13
Surprisingly good!!!	When I picked up &quot;Granny Dan&quot; I was a bit skeptical.  Historical romance is not my forte, but this book is good.  Danina is a bit naive but she's a wonderful character.  This book is  interesting enough to read in a day and I recommend it to all Steel  fans!!!!	1999-07-09
What a great little book!!!!	&quot;Durable Goods&quot; was a bit too short for my liking but.... I loved it.  Katie and her friend Cherylanne are on the verge of womanhood and are typical teens.  Her sister Diane is just about a woman and is  breaking away with her boyfriend.  I can hardly wait to read Joy School!!!!	1999-07-01
Not up to the usual standard.	&quot;A Certain Smile&quot; was an interesting book but not as good as some of the previous books by these authors.  I did enjoy the food descriptions throughout the book, even though other readers could not stand  them.  I wish the ending had been a little more complex and workable. I  enjoyed the characters of Miranda and Li, however, I could not stand Sheng.   Miranda's children should have been in the picture a lot more than they  were.	1999-06-29
A very interesting look at life!!!!	I read a lot of books; some I dislike and some I love.  This book was very good!!  Amy and her friend Stacy are the epitome of me in high school; smoking outside the school and hanging out in cars.  I especially loved Fat  Bev.  She was the icing on the cake and made Isabelle look like a  green-eyed monster! Isabelle acted much too old for her age. I wish the  book had been longer, but it was good nonetheless.  I can hardly wait for  another book by this author.	1999-06-28
This book was good, but I like her others better.	&quot;American Icon&quot; was not your typical Pat Booth book. I will say this much: I think I like her old books better.  This book was good, Kate and Peter and Donna and Steven are interesting enough, but it lacks all the  steamy scenes of her early books.  Try it, you'll like it!!!	1999-06-15
Jackie Collins is by far the best!!!!!	&quot;Dangerous Kiss&quot; was such a great book that I stayed up WAY later than I should have to read it!!  Lucky is the best!!!  &quot;Chances&quot; was my first Collins read, and I was done by the end of  the summer with the rest.  I especially love the fact that the chapters are  short and interesting. I wish Jackie could write faster because she simply  ROCKS!!!!!	1999-06-15
What A Great Book!!!!	&quot;Crazy For You&quot; was a great book, almost as great as &quot;Tell Me Lies.&quot;  Quinn has a lot on her plate: A man who is crazy about her needs to save her from another who is just plain crazy.  I can hardly wait  for her next book to come out.	1999-06-03
This book was the pits!!!!!!!	Daniel-Ian was a very boring book.  I was disappointed in it because it lacked the spark of her others.  Ian's story was definitely boring: It took me forever to drag myself through it.  I hope to like Serena-Caine  better!!!!!.	1999-05-11
A must read for &quot;Beaches&quot; fans!!!!	&quot;When I Fall In Love&quot; was a great read. Iris never fails to hold my interest.  Lily and Charlie start out on one foot and finish on the other.  It is a book that I read in 2 days.  It shows readers how people  act in show business.  I recommend it to anyone who read her other books  and even to people who didn't.	1999-04-28
One of King's Best!!!!!!	&quot;The Girl Who..... was one of my favorite King books so far!!!!  I started it on Wed. night and finished Fri. afternoon(I work 9 to 5). Trish talks like she's 40 and she's as smart as a whip!!!  This book was very  true-to-life. I just wish it was longer.  I hope for a sequel, or at least  another book that mentions this wonderfully smart creature!!!	1999-04-23
Nora never disappoints me!!!!!!	&quot;The Perfect Neighbor&quot; was another great read of Nora's.  I love &quot;The MacGregor&quot; and his clan and I can't wait to read &quot;Daniel-Ian&quot; and &quot;Serena-Caine!&quot; I think I'm out of  order!  Well, I think Nora is the best author I've found.	1999-04-22
Better than &quot;The Klone and I&quot; but not top-notch!	&quot;Bittersweet&quot; was a decent Steel read, however, she still lacks her old spirit.  Don't get me wrong, I've read all of her books, but this one was not as interesting as some.  I can hardly wait for &quot;Granny  Dan.&quot;	1999-04-22
This book has to be better than this to get an award!!!!	&quot;Charming Billy&quot; was not worth the wait I endured to get it. Oprah must be losing her marbles to recommend some of her recent books.  This book took me forever to read, and I'm a very fast reader.  I could  hardly wait to finish it and take it back!!!	1999-04-13
very realistic read!!!!!	&quot;Jewel&quot; was a finely told story of a woman and her six children. I especially loved the way Brett Lott used the accents.  This book was really good.  It took me a while to read it, but it was not boring in the  least.	1999-04-06
This is not the Sandra Brown I know and love!!!!	I never miss a SB novel, but this one I could have skipped.  It lacked depth and was very superficial.  I hope she writes new material soon!!!	1999-04-02
True Nora Roberts!	The MacGregors-Alan-Grant was a good book.  I have to say the first story was very boring, but I gave it 4 stars because of &quot;One Man's Art.&quot; Grant and Gennie were great!!!  I agree with the first review: Grant's eyes were brown in one story and deep green in the next.  Bear in  mind that those two stories were written years ago, and were done  separately.  I have not read the first book &quot;Serena and Caine&quot; as  of yet.  I expect it will be very good.	1999-03-10
Freddie and Nick really light this book up!!!!!	&quot;Waiting For Nick&quot; was a good book.  We finally find out what happens when Zack's little brother and Natasha's daughter finally get together in one city.  They definitely have the sparks flying in this book.  I was mad at Nick for being a jerk, but Freddie held her own.  I recommend  reading the other books in the series first so you can understand this one.	1999-03-03
This book was soo good, I hope for a sequel!	&quot;Crazy Ladies&quot; was a great read!!!!!  It starts with Gussie when she was 18 and the mother of Dorothy.  Gussie later gives birth to Clancy Jane.  Clancy was Gussie's favorite because Dorothy was always an evil  child.  Later in the book comes Bitsy, Mack, Violet and DeDe.  These women  all tell the story in their own words, and believe me, it's great!!!!!   Life, death, the works!!!!!	1999-02-24
This book was good!	Irish Rose was a quick read.  Nora Roberts rarely writes something I can't read.  The book was about a girl raised in Ireland, who comes to the U.S. to work.  She falls in love with her boss.  I recommend this to any fan of  Nora.	1999-02-24
A quick read	&quot;Sweet Anger&quot; was a quick read.  I failed to enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed some of her others.  Why in the world would a woman fall for a man who tried to finger her dead husband?  It seems to me that Kari Stewart  was rebounding any way she knew how.  This is not one of my favorites.	1999-02-08
Rachel and Natasha are the greatest!!!!	&quot;The Stanislaski Sisters&quot; were wonderful stories.  In &quot;Taming Natasha&quot;, &quot;Tash&quot; falls for Spencer Kimball, a music teacher.  Natasha was stubborn and snippy with Spence, but after  taking his class, she decides there's more to him than she first thought.   This one is my favorite of the two. In &quot;Falling For Rachel&quot;,  Rachel is the public defender for Nick LeBeck, an out-of-control teen with  an older brother named Zack Muldoon.  Nick falls for Rachel, and Rachel  falls for Zack.  Great ending to this story!!!!  I can hardly wait to read  &quot;Waiting For Nick&quot;!	1999-02-03
Billie Letts has my attention for sure!!!!!	&quot;The Honk and Holler&quot;....was absolutely fantastic!!!  Caney Paxton was injured in Vietnam and when he came home in a wheelchair, he never went outside.  MollyO, his faithful partner at the &quot;Honk&quot;,  is a mother of a teenage daughter who has run off.  Together the run the  &quot;Honk&quot; and have regular customers every day, but not a booming  business.  Then along comes Vena Takes Horse, and the whole place changed.  Vena decided Caney needed &quot;curbside sevice&quot;, so she took to  carhopping in the parking lot.  Caney falls in love with Vena.  Also on the  working crew is Bui, an immigrant from Viet Nam.  Vena and Bui finally get  Caney outside in a surprising way.  This is a great story, and I loved it  almost as much as &quot;Where The Heart Is.&quot; Ten thumbs up for this  one!!!!	1999-01-26
Wow!!! What A Great Book!!!!	Novalee Nation is stranded in a WAl-Mart parking lot after her no-good boyfriend leaves her there. Novalee sets up house in the Wal-Mart after hours, and decides life isn't so bad after all. She meets Sister Husband,  who invites her and her baby Americus, to live with her.  Novalee gains  many friends throughout this book, one being Forney Hull. This is a great  book, and is hard to put down until it's finished.  Oprah deserves an  &quot;A&quot; for this one!!!!	1999-01-25
An OK read, but not the best.	&quot;What Looks Like Crazy&quot;.... is supposedly a great book.  I didn't think it was too great.  Sure, it was easy reading, but it was not very interesting.  It took me longer to read than most books. Ava was a  character who you almost felt sorry for, but something held you back.  I  did however like the character of Eddie.  He was described to a  &quot;T&quot; and was in my opinion the best character in the book.	1999-01-25
What A Great Collection!!!!	&quot;The Boys Of My Youth&quot; was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Jo Ann Beard tells a tale of her life in short stories which are perfect to read in bed.  I loved the stories of her childhood the best,  especially with her sister Linda.  Their mother is a sharp-tongued, beer  drinking woman, their father a barroom lush.  Her and Linda get into more  than their share of trouble. This was a great book!!!	1999-01-20
More of the same V.C. Andrew's ghost written material	&quot;Olivia&quot; was an OK sequel to the &quot;Logan&quot; series. I did, however find myself rather bored and could hardly wait to finish it and read something else. This &quot;ghost-written&quot; material is the  pits. Belinda is an airheaded brat who always has to have her way and finds  out in the end where all that playing gets you. Olivia is purely  cold-hearted and loves playing a real-life general to all in her path.   Read this ONLY if you read the rest and need to finish the series.	1999-01-20
Much better than the first four books!	After reading the first 4 books in this series, I really didn't think this one would be any better.  Boy, was I ever wrong!!!!! RUNAWAYS was really great!!! The 4 girls set off on their own, after a few bad experiences with  their foster father. I read this in 2 days and had I had more time, I would  have been done in a day!!! If the 1st four books disappointed you, this one  will change your mind!!!! I can hardly wait for the new book  &quot;Olivia&quot; to come out!	1999-01-06
Nora is the best!!!!	&quot;Convincing Alex&quot; was a cute book about one of the Stanislaski siblings. Alexi is tall, dark and handsome and a member of the Police force.  Along comes Bess McKnee, little rich girl working on a new plot for  her soap opera.  She decides to use Alexi as her next mission.  Alexi does  not find Bess amusing at first, but soon warms up to her a lot. I can  hardly wait to read the &quot;Stanislaski Sisters.&quot;	1999-01-04
