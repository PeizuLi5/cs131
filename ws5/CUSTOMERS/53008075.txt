classic in the genre	Originally written in 1912, Zane Grey's most famous book (and his best) is universally considered a classic of the Western genre. That's not to say it is the best western written, or that Grey is the best western writer. The book is pretty good, I rather enjoyed it. There are negatives, one is the way he portrays Mormons, though I'm not sure if it is \\"accurate\\" since I'm not sure how Mormons acted in the 19th century, but it could be considered offensive. Grey's characters are also weak. They tend to be either stereotypical or one-dimensional. And his dialog is laughable. But Grey shines in his landscape descriptions. Truly a beautiful picture he can paint with words. His stilted dialogue is made up for by his beautiful descriptive passages. The book is also rife with symbols--Grey can work (whether intentional or not) in many levels. It has it's problems, but it is an enjoyable book. Any fan of the Western should read it, and maybe even thoughs who don't visit the genre often.	2005-09-14
wonderful collection	I loved Curious George when I was a kid, I mean I loved this monkey. And revisiting him or 20 years later, I found that I still love George. And it is great to find all the books in this one, nice, hardcover collection. I read it to my nephew and neice, and they loved it, as I'm sure your kids will too (and more than a few of you adults).	2005-08-22
brilliant	C.S. Lewis, besides being a great fiction writer and a fair poet, is a briliant mind. His theology, well, his theology is the theology that you want to read. When you read this book you can really see one of the greatest minds at work. For the faithful as well as the unfaithful intellect, this is a book to read.	2005-08-22
actually pretty good	In my search for my faith, I was recommended Strobel's Case for Christ. It has turned out to be a good choice. Sure Strobel doesn't present everything or even both sides (interviewing a rebuttal expert would have been a welcomed addition). And some of the arguements were weak, like the section on archeology (though I feel that was more the fault of his expert than the evidence out there), the chapter \\"Was Jesus Convinced That He Was teh Son of God?, the psychological evidence, the chapter on the evidence of his appearances after death, and the final chapter, the circumstantial evidence. But even after that is said, Strobel's book makes a strong case for the life of Christ as the Son of God. The book makes no apologies for being a book supporting Christianity, but then that is what it is. It's sure to be a true joy for those with faith and I think is valuable for those searching, though only as a starting place and not where you want to stop.	2005-08-22
how it should have been	Sylvia Plath, though at times seems more famous for her death than her work, is one of our greatest poets. She helped usher in a new ages of poetry, of personal poetry. She is the author of \\"Daddy\\" which is on my list of top ten poems, and found in this collection. When she died, she had this manuscript on her desk. Ted Hughes published it, but with some major changes. Her daughter Frieda Hughes (also a poet) has published the restored version, the last version Plath herself had created. And this is a very different book, not as dark, since some of her last poems, her darkest, were not in this collection originally (though Ted Hughes put them in his version). It's true we don't know exactly what the final version Plath would have published, since she was constantly revising the book, but this is a valuable book to have. And not just because of the poetry. It also contains facsimilies of the manuscript of the the poem \\"Ariel\\" and you can see genius at work. This is a valuable book and even if you have her Collected Poems (and you should), you should still pick up this book.	2005-08-08
is alright	This book contains the complete paintings of Toulouse-Lautrec (made famous by John Leguizamo in the recent film Moulin Rouge). Lautrec is an ok painter, though he does have several that really shine. My biggest fault with the book was that while it does contain all of his paintings, most are in thumbnails, and black and white on top of that. Still, maybe it is that Lautrec doesn't deserve (because his talent isn't that great) a more 'complete' book like Van Gogh or Picasso do.	2005-08-08
great	This books contains the Pulitzer winning photographs from 1942-1977. These are truly some of our greatest pieces of photojournalism, and it is great to see them all in one place (with a great page-length essay on each). This is a book that should definitely be updated periodically, and it is. So go for one of the later books that have more of the photos. And enjoy, see some of the best photojournalism ever done.	2005-08-08
nice intro	Well, Degas is one of our greatest painters, and his work should be well known, or at least much more well known. Sure this book is slim and doesn't cover much, but it is a nice intro to his work, and can lead you on to more Degas. It's brief, but hey, it'll do it for you.	2005-08-08
nice, but rather basic	McDowell wrote this little book to help 'prove' Christ lived. I say he does a fairly good job. He keeps it a little simplistic (try Case for Christ for something more), but raises some good points. This book isn't going to change anyone's opiniont, but for Christians looking for more, or someone that is riding the fence or searching, it might help. More could have been done, but McDowell gives a nice, if basic, start.	2005-08-08
amazing book	I have to say that I found this to be an amazing book, though not quite what it is advertised to be. Pagels does discuss the gospel of Thomas somewhat here and there and she includes Thomas's book at the end of her book, but this book is more about the Gospel of John and early Christian history and the formation of the church and biblical canon. I didn't quite get what I was expecting, but I still got a great book that taught me a lot. This is a great book for anyone who has questions about Christianity. It might answer some questions.	2005-08-01
a valuable resource	Dr. Amador has written a valuable resource for the families of the serious mentally ill. (to be honest, it is of some help to the actually mentally ill, or at least those of us who have a grasp on our illness) He speaks from both a clinical experience, from working with the mentally ill for years, as well as from personal experience, his brother is a schizophrenic. The book is loaded with valuable information, and written in such a way that any layman can understand what he is saying. I'm glad to see that someone has tackled this subject, and in such a way that we all can benefit and understand what he is saying. This book can really help many members of the mentally ill community. I only hope that more professionals learn about it and can recommend it to the family members of their patients. <br /> <br /> --a reader with bipolar disorder	2005-07-25
wow	You know, I've found that as Rowling's series goes on, it only gets better. As you read the six books, you can see Rowling's evolution as a writer. Her characters get fuller, the plot thicker, and her skills just improve greatly from one novel to the next. I though Order of the Phoenix was great, and that perhaps she had reached her apex as a writer. I was wrong. Book six is a great book, one of the best works of fiction I have read this year (providing, of course, you've read the first five books and have gotten to know and care about the characters--and that is something Rowling does well: makes you really care about these characters and what happens to them). It is by far the best of the series (after reading Phoenix I was ready for the next book, but had no trouble waiting, but I tell you, waiting for the final book is going to be agony, the story has gotten that good). It's also the most mature and darkest of the books, while still being appropriate for younger audiences. But it is a dark book, which I'm sure is one reason why I liked it so much. People say that a book is so good that you can't put it down, but this one that isn't just a saying, it is the truth. Especially the last 150 pages or so. I stayed up later than I had planned to because I couldn't go to sleep until I finished the book. This book is really the capstone of the series. In fact, it's so good, that I recommend reading the Potter series just so you can get to this book and read it with the full impact that is intended.	2005-07-19
a brief survey of a master of painting	\\"Colour possesses me... That is the meaning of this happy hour: colour and I are one. I am a painter.\\" --Paul Klee <br /> <br />This book contains 48 full-color plates. They are of high quality and full page (I'm not sure the exact dimensions of the book, but it is quite large). I'm not sure how I feel about Klee's work as a whole, since there isn't a large enough sample contained here, but the paintings contained in this book are amazing, or most of them are at least. Klee was truly an astounding artist. That, though, brings up my only fault with the book, it is such a brief book that you don't get enough of Klee's work. Hopefully there are other surveys of his work out there, one that is more complete. And if not, I hope that one soon will be, from what I've seen here, he certainly deserves one.  <br /> <br />The book starts with a medium length essay by Douglas Hall, who I understand to be one of the world's leading experts on Klee. It's not as inclusive as a book-length biography, but Hall definitely gives you a fair sense of Klee's life and a good idea of how to look at Klee's work. He goes in depth on several of the paintings represented within.  <br /> <br />I believe this book is out of print so you will have to go to your local library and check out a copy, but it is worth doing so, so that you can get an introduction to one of our more important artists.	2005-07-16
great memoir	Hamill's memoir is great prose. He discusses growing up in New York in the post WWII years and his early years as a newspaperman, though not much time is spent on his life in the business (I wish he had spent some more time on what it has been like for him to be a reporter). It some ways Hamill fits the stereotype of the hard drinking, tough newspaper reporter, but he also breaks that mold with a sensitity and intelligence rarely seen in his line of work anymore. And this is a nice study of art, it'll give you some good artists to start with, and what it's like to struggle with being an artist. Hamill makes no excuses for his drinking or the ways that it affected his life, but unlike many other drinking memoirs, he doesn't preach, and the sole focus isn't to push a 12 step program, rather it is to warn about the dangers of alcoholism and tell the story one man's (interesting) life.	2005-07-15
touching	This is a great book of photographs. I hate to use the word touching, because it is so cliche, but it really is a touching collection. It trully honors women and womanhood. The photographs are wonderful (though there are these occassional blank pages scattered throughout that sort of threw me off) and there are a smattering of great quotes that celebrate womanhood.	2005-07-14
truly a love story	The subtitle of this book is a love story, and that is what this book is, a love story between one woman and alcohol (it seems all she writes are love stories, Pack of Two is a love story between her and her dog, also a great book). It's the story of how alcohol slowly takes over, consumes, and ruins the lives of an alcoholic. But it is also the story of hope. It is the story of how one alcoholoc found help and recovery in the walls of AA and regained her life. It's an uplifting book and one that anyone with a substance abuse problem should read, though you don't have to be an alcoholic or addict to enjoy this book or get something out of it. Knapp is a wonderful writer.	2005-07-13
ultimately a love story	Knapp basically writes love stories (she's known for Drinking: A Love Story, which is a memoir about her love for alcohol and battle with alcoholism), and Pack of Two is basically a love story about a woman and her dog. It's a sweet, touching memoir. I was expecting something a little more scientific, something that would make me understand the mind of a dog better, and though this is a memoir of a writer's experience with her dog, I think that I understand my dog better for reading this book. I think this book is a must for any dog lovers. <br />	2005-07-12
satire at its finest	Jon Stewart and the writers at The Daily Show are a funny group of guys, all you have to do is watch The Daily Show to see that. And this book reflects their humor. It is smart, political humor. It is topical. It is satire. It is parody. It is hilarious. But I knew it would be. What I didn't know (and I had know clue of because they never hinted at it) is that they put it in a textbook format. It took me back to my middle school days, except I learned more about politics in this book than I ever did in my school days (much as I learn more about current events from The Daily Show than I do from CNN). I can't recommend this book enough, unless of course you watch Fox News religiously.	2005-07-10
Just keeps getting better	Volume 1 was a good start, volume 2 was where King hit his stride with the series, volume 3 is where the series really got really, really good. Jake is back. Eddie and Susannah (formerly known as Odetta/Detta) are fully developed as characters. The story is fleshed out and much more takes place. Even Roland is a more three dimensional character in this installment, whereas he was almost a two dimensional stereotype in the other two volumes. I've said King hit his stride in volume 2, and the story really did, but this is where it gets really good and really sucks you in. It works on many levels. The only problem is the cliffhanger that King leaves you with at the end. Sort of a cheap shot, especially when you consider how long it takes King to write another Dark Tower book. Though now that the series is complete and you can read it all from start to finish, the cliffhanger isn't that big of a problem. But it sure was back then. If you weren't real keen on volume one, you have to give volumes 2 and 3 a try. And even though 3 is better than 2, if you didn't like 2, I'm not real sure that 3 will bring you into the saga. ALthough it might. give it a try.	2005-07-10
poetry in prose	This is the latest book (both in terms of publishing and in order that I've read) that I've added to my \\"book club\\", that is to say, my favorite books--books that I think everyone should own, or at least read at least once. This is a very poetical book. Canty's prose is a lyrical prose. It's a melancholy book that has a certain hopeful hopelessness to it. It's the story of an over-the-hill, overweight poet who is past his artistic prime who gets a teaching position in an out of the way school. His marriage is over as is his career. He has lost his talent and his life to alcoholism. While at this school he meets a troubled young student. These two people are drawn to each other and in each other find each other's salvation, of a sorts. It's a haunting story, one that ranks with any of the finest pieces of literature written. This is a book that you simply must read. And the cover art fits the story wonderfully.	2005-07-10
here's where the series really picks up speed	Volume 2 is really King really starts to hit his stride. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Gunslinger, but The Drawing of the Three is where the story really starts to pick up and become the classic it has become. It is the story of Roland picking up two of his three companions, the heroin addict Eddie, and the crippled, multiple personality Oddetta/Detta. King's characters are vivid, and you have to wonder, where does he come up with this stuff (come on, lobstrosities...).  Even if you weren't a big fan of volume one, you have to try volume two before you give up on your quest for the Tower. I think you'll find you'll want to continue on.	2005-07-09
the beginning of a saga	Somewhere around 30 years ago  Stephen King began a saga (one which many of us wondered if he'd ever finish) of epic proportions: The Dark Tower. Personally, I think it is his best work. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, Jake, the man in black, and the Dark Tower. It's a series of interrelated long short stories. And you can tell it is an older piece of King's, it reads like an older work of King's (even though he has somewhat revised it slightly in this latest edition). But still, even though it hasn't the narrative speed the other volumes has, it has its charm, and it is vital in introducing us to the character of Roland and Roland's quest. If you haven't started this series yet, why wait? He's finished the story. Get to it.	2005-07-09
what a narrative should be	In his Reaper Essays Jarman espouses the positive characteristics of the narrative poem, and then in his book-length narrative poem, _Iris_, he puts in practice what he puts forth in theory. He uses long lines--ten feet of iambic pentameter. The story is of a young mother, Iris, and her search for family and for the meaning in the poetry of Robinson Jeffers. Section one is as good as you are going to find in narrative poetry. I will admit that section two is rather weak. But he rises again in section three, wich is rather good, it doesn't rise up to what you find in section one, but then what could, but still, it is quite good. I highly recommend this book as an example of what narrative poetry should be.	2005-07-07
hilarious and poignant	I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show and one of my favorite segments is Lewis Black's segment, so I ran out and bought his book when it was published. And it doesn't disappoint. It's part memoir, part satire, part rant, and very funny, but it is funny in and intelligent way. You have to have the right sense of humor for this book. If you voted for Bush, don't bother buying this. But if you like intelligent, insightful humor, then this book is definitely for you.	2005-07-01
Pretty Good King Story	King wrote Eyes of the Dragon as a \\"children's story\\" for his young (at the time) children, because they were too young to read his books. King actually pulls off writing for a younger audience pretty well. The narrator has a distinctive voice. And this one is supposed to tie in pretty closely with the Dark Tower series. It is your typical coming of age fairy tale story. Well-written.	2005-07-01
Review of abridged audio cd	This is the only audio book that I own--I've always enjoyed reading rather than listening to a book being read to me (live readings are an exception of course). But Fox's memoir was recommended to me, in the audio book version rather than the print version. And this is very good. You get the sense that Fox is sitting in the room with you just talking, telling you the story of his life. And what a life it is. It is full of struggle and you realize just how long and how serious his disease is. It is truly an amazing story and I highly recommend this book... in the audio version.	2005-07-01
phenomenal	This is a phenomenal study of the artistic spirit and alcoholism. Dardis takes our three greatest writers of the last century, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and Hemingway, and the greatest American playwrite, Eugene O'Neill, and studies the effect their alcoholism had on their work. It's a frightening tale for any writer battling addiction. It's a critical/biographical/sociological study of the best American letters had to offer at the turn of the last century. Read it.	2005-06-30
nothing spectacular	This book claims to have an interesting premise, and I quote from the back, \\"This elegant and moving collection grew out of Hilda Raz's experience with her son's journey to a transgender identity.\\" And while she does touch on it in several poems, she leaves so much of this unmined. I didn't find any of the poems in the book to be particularly outstanding, and as a whole the collection was rather weak, though it did have some highlights. It starts with a great poem by Rilke. Tough to live up to, and she does not. You get a couple of good lines and stanzas here and there, but there are so many really good collections of poetry out there, that you can safely avoid this one.	2004-12-29
Bollingen Prize winner	I know Gluck has won all kinds of awards and honors, but to be honest, I found this collection to be mediocre (though her poem \\"Youth\\" is pretty good). It isn't bad, but it isn't something that I'd recommend anyone run out and buy.	2004-12-29
Great introduction to contemporary American poetry	This is a great anthology. It should come to no surprise, since R.S. Gwynn is a well-respected anthologist, and has the highly successful Longman Pocket series (I highly recommend his Longman Poetry: A Pocket Anthology). And April Lindner brings a nice sensibility to this project. They cover the full range of poets and poetic schools, each with header notes. And unlike many other anthologies of contemporary poetry that I've seen, this one is affordable and has one of the best mixes of poets I've seen. My only complaint is that you won't find any poems by either Gwynn or Lindner within, and both are phenomenal poets. But I understand that they had limited space and chose to cut themselves out. Hopefully in the next edition...  <br /> <br />So, if you are looking for a good introduction to contemporary American poetry, you won't find a finer anthology than this one. I highly recommend you add it to your shelves.	2004-12-29
Pulitzer Winner	This is the second book of Gluck's that I have read (also read The Seven Ages), and I'm not very impressed with her. Sure she has won all kinds of awards and accolades, but I have to disagree with the academy here. Her work isn't bad, just mediocre and rather uninteresting, though this book is better than The Seven Ages. There were a few really good poems found within this collection. Not enough to really pull it off though. And this is the book that won the Pulitzer (which just goes to show you that though the Pulitzer is a well-respected prize, they generally award it to books that are NOT the most deserving). I suppose you have to read this book for yourself to understand, and who knows, maybe you'll be like so many others and like it.	2004-12-29
interesting anthology	Kennedy has put together an interesting anthology, a collection of 'hate' poems--poems devoted or about the theme, emotion, idea of hate. And you'd be surprised what you'll find inside. It's a pretty good mix of poems. Section 1 is \\"In Praise of Hate\\" and is by far the best section. You'll find some of my favorite poems: Frost's \\"Fire and Ice\\", William Blake's \\"A Poison Tree\\", \\"WC Williams \\"The Savage Beast\\", Thoreau \\"Indeed indeed, I cannot tell\\", and Dylan Thomas' \\"Do not go gentle into that good night.\\" You'll also find poems by Frank O'Connor, Yeats, Eliot, J.V. Cunningham, Snodgrass, and A.D. Hope. Section 2, \\"Nearest But Not Dearest\\" has one of my top ten poems, Sylvia Plath's \\"Daddy\\", as well as poems by Shakespeare (Lear's curse on Goneril), Shelley, Frank O'Connor, Ted Hughes, Alan Dugan, and John Ciardi's poem \\"Censorship.\\" Section 3, \\"Sexual Skirmishes,\\" while not having any truly spectuacular poems, does contain poems by J.V. Cunningham, Margaret Atwood, Snodgrass, Robert Graves, William Meredith, Anthony Hecht, John Donne, WC WIlliams, and Gary Snyder. Section 4 is titled \\"Personal Animosities\\" and contains the poets Ted Hughes, D.H. Lawrence, Jonathan Swift, William Blake, Pope, Tennyson, Robert Graves, Joyce, Ginsberg, Dickinson, hardy, SNodgrass, Cunningham, Robert Browning, A.R. Ammons, and Robert Frost. Section 5, \\"Collective Detestations,\\" has poems by Milton, D.H. Lawrence, Heaney, Coleridge, James Wright, Kunitz, and Philip Larkin. You'll find H.D.'s \\"Helen\\" in section 6, \\"Nobles, Statesmen, Prelates, and Top Brass.\\" There you'll also find the poets Andrew Marvell, Pope, Shelley, Lord Byron, Ben Jonson, THomas Gray, Tim Steele, Robert Burns, Richard Wilbur, cummings, Milton, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Siegfried Sassoon. Section 7, \\"Poets, Critics, and Scholars,\\" contains John Skelton, Dryden, Swift, Pope, Burns, Landor, Robert Browning, Hemingway, Roethke, Nemerov, Cowper, Donald Hall, and a great poem by John Frederick Nims called \\"Eminent Critic.\\" The short section 8 called \\"Offending Race of Humankind\\" contains poems by Shakespeare (Timon's curse of Athens and mankind), Milton, Swift, Nims, Housman, Levine, and Kingsley Amis. \\"Dmaned Abstractions\\", section 9 has poems by Pound, Spenser, Blake, Poe, Kipling, cummings, Galway Kinnell, Yeats, and Philip Larkin. You'll find \\"The Crow\\" a great poem by Robert Creeley in section 10, \\"This Vile Created World\\". You'll also find Shakespeare (Lear's speach to teh storm), Pound, Ransom, Shapiro, Herman Melville, and Snodgrass here. Section 11 is \\"Self-Loathing\\". This is where you'll find William Cowper's poem [LInes written during a brief period of instanity], Peter Davison's \\"The Cost of Pretending\\", and Stephen Crane's \\"The Heart.\\" YOu'll also find Whitman, Emily Bronte, Gerard Manley HOpkins, Cunningham, Betjeman, Roethke, and Robinson Jeffers. THe final section is \\"Against Hate\\" which has a great poem by Gary Gildner called \\"First Practice.\\" Also is Auden, Tennyson, John Scott, Gibbons Ruark, Anne Sexton, Bly, Harry Edwards, Yvor Winters, Linda Pastan, and ending the book is Edwin Muir. This anthology is out of print, so it may be hard to find, but it is worth it.	2004-12-26
Surprisingly good	Apparently this book was some sort of runaway bestseller in England (and from what I've heard, it isn't doing too bad here either), though this surprises me. I wouldn't have thought this book would be interesting to anyone who wasn't an English student or teacher, writer, editor, or someone else in the field. It goes to show you, you never can tell what is going to catch on. The book is well-written and really delves into matters of punctuation. One warning, it was written in England, so some of the rules are a little different than what we have over here.	2004-12-25
great long poem	This book is divided into two sections. The first contains a handful of Wiman's shorter poems. And to be honest, there is nothing particularly spectacular about them. That being said, section two is a long narrative, the title poem. And it is pretty good. It covers the life of woman growing up in West Texas in the early part of this century. Wiman writes very well in her voice and keeps her an interesting character. The story is an interesting one and he keeps the narrative flow going quite well. While I wasn't impressed with the poems in section one, I will be buying this book for the title poem.	2004-12-16
extremely uneven	This collection of poems is extremely uneven. Lumsden's early work, _Yeah Yeah Yeah_ and _The Book of Love_ contains an overall work that isn't too bad (and here is where you'll find the great poem \\"Always\\"). But it isn't enough to carry the book. The new poems are weak and trite. And the previously unpublished sonnet sequence, Cavoli Riscaldati and his collection _Roddy Lumsden is Dead_ is just plain bad. There's nothing real great here. And I had such high hopes for this collection. <br /> <br />Always <br /> <br />After the full-day's westward drive you find <br />the house familiar from a photograph, <br />its brass-hung door thrown wide. <br /> <br />A meeting party welcomes you: up front, <br />the matriarch, corn hair tied in a bunch, <br />the husband of few words <br /> <br />and, in behind two sniffly, smutty boys <br />you'll take a good few days to tell apart, <br />a gran'ma, blunt and blouse. <br /> <br />It's then that you sense her, in and down the hall, <br />so vague, at first you take her for a shadow <br />or portrait on the wall, <br /> <br />the daughter who, that night, will steal in slow <br />to visit you with kisses coarse and sweet, <br />to gift you with her heat, <br /> <br />and who through the remainder of the week <br />won't speak again, although you send her notes, <br />whose name you never know. <br /> <br />And always this will whittle at your wits-  <br />the way she gave her nightdress to the floor, <br />one finger to her lips <br /> <br />to call aboard the silence of the land <br />to forge the night-time colours in her hair-  <br />until you grow unsure <br /> <br />of what was real and what was in the wind, <br />of all that being meant before and since <br />that single word she said. <br />	2004-12-11
you've gotta have this	I haven't read Jean Valentine's work, but I cannot imagine her book being more worthy of the National Book Award than Justice's Collected Poems. This book is phenomenal. Justice almost doesn't write a bad poem, and he writes many great ones. He has a formal mastery and a mastery of free verse. Justice has a way with words, metaphor, imagery, the line, with everything that makes a poem great that few of his contemporaries have. And this spans his career. You get his early great work, which includes the poems \\"On the Death of Friends in Childhood,\\" \\"Thus,\\" \\"Women in Love,\\" \\"A Winter Ode to the Old Men of Lummus Park, Miami, Florida,\\" \\"Counting the Mad, \\"Men at Forty\\" (his best poem), \\"To the Unknown Lady Who Wrote the Letters Found in a Hatbox,\\" \\"The Grandfathers,\\" \\"The Telephone Number of the Muse\\"--to his midcareer greats (my favorite being \\"My South\\"), and even in his seventies he still continuted to write great poems (see \\"Ralph: A Love Story\\" in the New Poems section). He's truly a master. <br /> <br />Men at Forty <br /> <br />Men at forty  <br />Learn to close softly <br />The doors to rooms they will not be <br />Coming back to. <br /> <br />At rest on a stair landing, <br />They feel it moving <br />Beneath them now like the deck of a ship, <br />Though the swell is gentle. <br /> <br />And deep in mirrors <br />They rediscover <br />The face of the boy as he practices tying <br />His father's tie there in secret, <br /> <br />And the face of that father, <br />Still warm with the mystery of lather. <br />They are more fathers than sons themselves now. <br />Something is filling them, something <br /> <br />That is like the twilight sound <br />Of the crickets, immense, <br />Filling the woods at the foot of the slope <br />Behind their mortgaged houses. <br />	2004-11-30
gripping	Though this is a long book, it takes little time to read. That is because Dan Brown writes a book that is gripping and interesting. His characters come to life. He is the master of the cliffhanger--each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and there are over a hundred chapters in the book. And it is full of all kinds of arcane knowledge. This is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it to everyone.	2004-11-17
good story, weak ending	I haven't read a Koontz novel in a quite a while, but I remember enjoying his work. So it really came to no surprise that I found myself enjoying The Taking. It is well written, full of suspense, though the characters are as fully realized as they could be. The ending is weak though and overly religious. This book does remind me of a cross between Stephen King (specifically \\"The Mist\\" and The Stand) and M. Knight Shymalan. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend the book, but for some light reading, it's enjoyable.	2004-11-06
worth getting	Most of us in America have little idea of what is going on in the British poetry scene. This anthology helps remedy that. Admittedly it only gives a partial sense of what is going on over there, but still, we get a good idea. And it is filled with some great poetry. Sure there is a few bad poems and some mediocre poems, but there is a lot of great poetry in this anthology. There are great poems by Michael Donaghy (though the editors missed a couple of Donaghy's best poems), James Fenton, Carol Ann Duffy, Glyn Maxwell, Andrew Motion, and Roddy Lumsden. And at least one really good poem by Ian Duhig, Christopher Reid, Anne Rouse, and Jo Shapcott.	2004-11-02
great collection	This is the book Maxine Kumin selected for the 2003 National Poetry Series. And it is a great book. It's divided into five sections, each named after a city in Louisiana. The best by far is the first, New Orleans. I will say Natchitoches, the final section was pretty weak, except for the poem \\"On the Departure of My Guest.\\" Kane writes in form excellently. She does a lot of villanelles, and though I thought I'd get tired of reading so many of them, I didn't. She handles the villanelle very well. And, as you would guess from the title, alcohol plays a big part in this book. Many of the poems have bartender or a bar or something alcohol related in the title. But once again, you don't get tired of it because she handles it well. This is a really good first collection. If you are a fan of Kim Addonizio, Everette Maddox, or Sara Cortez, then you'll definitely like this book. Some poems to take note of are: \\"Maraschino Cherries,\\" \\"Villanelle for Thel,\\" \\"Mapleworld,\\" and \\"Booker Again.\\" Once again, this is a great book.	2004-10-14
another fine collection by kooser	Although I didn't think this collection was quite as good as Delights & Shadows or his Selected Poems, Weather Central is a fine collection of poems. I recommend \\"Four Secretaries\\", \\"In Passing\\", \\"A Statue of the Unknown Soldier\\", and \\"Weather Central.\\" The poems seem to be a bit longer than what he usually writes, though the rest of Kooser's characteristics are here. He still is plainspoken. He is still a simple poet. He's still a poet everyone can love.	2004-10-06
shows promise	It isn't that she is a bad poet or that the poems were bad. They just weren't great poems and they didn't personally reach out to me. My biggest fault with the poems was that they seemed to be held at a distance from the reader. There was a certain amount of coldness for lack of a better word. They were very musical, both in subject matter (most poems dealt with music in one way or another) and in her style of writing. Schoerke handles both formal verse and free verse very well. I think she has a lot of promise as a poet and I'm curious to see where she develops from here.	2004-10-06
great collection	Ted Kooser is the poet of the common man. He is known as a regionalist, though his poems speak to people from all over the country. And his selected poems show you exactly the skill of this poet. Kooser is the master of the short poem and of the simple poem. He is a pleasure to read. This collection contains such fine poems such as \\"Selecting a Reader\\", \\"Spring Plowing\\", \\"A Summer Night\\", \\"Carrie\\", \\"A Hairnet with Stars\\" and \\"Abandoned Farmhouses\\" (which might be his best poem). I highly recommend this collection.	2004-10-06
kooser's best book	I think Kooser's latest book is his best book yet. The poems are concise and written in that plainspoken style Kooser has perfected. And Kooser speaks a poetic language we can all understand. There are five poems that really stand out in the collection. \\"Tattoo\\" deals with the fading and aging not just of a man's tatoo, but in a way, of man himself. It's a simply elegant poem. \\"At the Cancer Clinic\\" is perhaps the finest poem in the book. Very elegant. Very simple. And wonderful. \\"A Rainy Morning\\" compares the operation of a wheelchair with the playing of a piano, which is a fresh and vibrant metaphor, at least in Kooser's hands. \\"Memory\\" is atypical of Kooser. It is longer than most of his poems and is one marathon sentence that employs more poetic tricks than one is used to seeing in his poetry. But it suceeds and very well. And finally \\"Mother\\" which I think you can only appreciate by reading. Kooser's poems speak (much like his predecessor Billy Collins) to the common reader. That isn't to say that his poems aren't worth rereading. You gain much by revisiting a Kooser poem. He is one of the best writing today.	2004-10-06
Truly, one of the giants	When you think of the best poets ever, T.S. Eliot is one of those that comes to mind. His work is well crafted, intelligent, beautifully written, and has a flow to it that few poets can match. And this is a fine collection for the Eliot lover or for the reader unfamiliar with Eliot. It's divided into several sections. The first section is his Prufrock section, poems from 1917, which contains probably his finest poems: \\"Prufrock\\", \\"Preludes\\" \\"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\\", \\"Hysteria\\", among others. Then there is the Poems 1920 section which also contains many fine poems (\\"Sweeney Erect\\" and \\"The Hippopotamus\\" being my favorites). Then follows his masterpiece The Wasteland. Then The Hollow Men which is followed by the wonderful Ash Wednesday. Then the Ariel Poems (which contains \\"Journey of the Magi\\"). Then there are two unfinished poems, \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" and \\"Coriolan\\" which I thought were weak. Maybe they would have been great had he ever finished them. Then there is a section called minor poems followed by the mediocre \\"Choruses from 'The Rock.' And then there is what I consider to be his true masterpiece, \\"Four Quartets.\\" And the book finishes with some occasional verses, one of which is a sweet and touching poem to his wife. This is a great collection of poems.	2004-08-28
as good or better than Turco	Wow, this book has made quite an impression. There is nothing I can say to top what has been said already, but what I can do is add my two cents of approval. I actually prefer this book over Turco's Book of Forms. It reads better and explains the forms better. This books covers a wide variety of traditional and experimental forms of poetry. And Finch and Varnes pulled together a diverse group of poets, from R.S. Gwynn and Dana Gioia to Maxine Chernoff and DJ Renegade. From Anthony Hecht to Paul Hoover. There's Tim Steele, Jan Hodge, X.J. Kennedy, Agha Shahid Ali, Maxine Kumin, Charles Bernstein, adn Billy COllins. You get all styles of poets and poetry within. For any serious poet, this is a must have book. And it is loaded with great examples of each type it discusses.	2004-08-27
an american giant at his best	Robert Lowell is a giant in American poetry. He is pretty much unanimously considered one of the best of his generation. This book combines two of his volumes of poetry. One of those volumes is his masterpiece Life Studies--the reason why he is a giant in American poetry. This is his seminal work. No matter how you look at it, this is an important book of poetry. And an excellent book of poetry. Most of the poems are good and there are several phenomenal poems within. Life Studies alone belongs on any serious poetry connoisseur's shelf. Also in this book is arguably Lowell's second best collection (only Lord Weary's Castle might be better) For the Union Dead, which contains another masterpiece, \\"For the Union Dead\\" (and a favorite of mine \\"Hawthorne\\"). This is a book that poetry lovers of all kinds should have.	2004-08-16
you don't even have to know who he is	You don't have to be a fan of Lenny Bruce to love this book, you don't have to really know who he is (I really only know him from a few recordings and by reputation). This book is funny. This book is still a valuable piece of social satire and criticism. This book is an interesting story. This book is a piece of history. This book is great. This book should be read.	2004-08-16
a dark poet	Weldon Kees has been recommended to me by more than one person. And the reason is that he is a very dark poet, and a very interesting one at that. Kees is slightly outside of academia, though his reputation is getting bigger. I found his earlier work to be better than his later work, that's not to say that there isn't good stuff in his later work, just that I preferred his early work. I'd also recommend you did up a good biography of Kees, since he also has an interesting life.	2004-08-15
an american master	To My Sister; The Heron; No Bird; Elegy for Jane; She; Her Reticence; The Meadow Mouse; and of course, My Papa's Waltz--these are all some of the great poems that Theodore Roethke wrote. Roethke is one of our American masters. I found that when he was on his game (as he was in the poems above, among others) his poetry was phenomenal, but when he wasn't, his poetry could be awful. His earlier work is better than his later work, though he seems to have gotten most of his recognition for his later work. Still, for the poetry lover this is pretty much a required volume for your shelves.	2004-08-15
wondeful collection	Fenton has put together a great collection of essays/lectures covering a wide variety of subjects. He has some great essays on Plath, Auden, Moore, among others. There are a few dull essays. Don't get me wrong, they are intelligently written, it is just that the subject matter is dull (for example, Wilfred Owen's juvenalia). But on the whole this is a great collection for all poetry lovers.	2004-08-12
not bad	I'd put this book at the lower end of the four star spectrum, almost three stars, and maybe it is the strength of his previous collection, Local Men, that helps me to give this such a high rating. But I do think Whitehead is a poet that is underappreciated and not as well known as he should be. He has the wonderfully concise poems written in the most interesting of voices under the most ridiculously long titles. Whitehead is the perfect blend of colloquialism and intelligence. I do recommend you pick up his collections of poetry. They are hard to get a hold of, but worth finding.	2004-08-12
i expected better	After all the hype, after all the wonderful things I had heard about James Fenton, I was expecting a great collection of poetry when I picked up Out of Danger. Boy was I disappointed. Fenton spent too much time trying to be political or to vague in his writing. There were a couple of bright spots in the collection. The title poem is one of the best he has ever written and there is another poem, \\"In Paris With You\\" which isn't a great poem, but it is a charming one that I think you'll find as wonderful as I do.	2004-08-12
amazing	Without a doubt Philip Larkin is one of the most loved and most respected poets in the English language. And all you have to do is read his poems to understand why. He has technical mastery, a command of the English language, and he speaks to all of us not just the professors and intellectuals. And there are any number of poems of his that are wonderful and that we can all love. Here are just a few of my favorites: <br /> <br />Traumerei; At Grass; Mother, Summer, I; Reasons for Attendance; I Remember, I Remember; Church Going; Maiden Name; First Sight; The Whitsun Weddings; Letter to a Friend about Girls; Faith Healing; High Windows; Sympathy in White Major; This Be the Verse (my absolute favorite); Cut Grass; The Old Fools; Morning at last: there in the snow; The little lives of earth and form; and Aubade.  <br /> <br />Read him and you'll love him too.	2004-08-12
good anthology	This book caused a bit of controversy, but I'm not sure why. What it is, is a collection of poems that Keillor thought were good poems. It isn't meant to teach out of or to be representative of anything other than one man's personal tastes. And what taste he has. Sure there are some poets and poems missing. And there are some bad poems in here. But most are good poems and then there are some truly great poems in here. But I'll let the poets included speak for themselves. Here is a partial list of SOME of the poets you'll find within: <br /> <br />Ginger Andrews, W.H. Auden, Hillaire Belloc, Wendell Berry, John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, William Blake, Robert Bly, David Budbill, Charles Bukowski, Robert Burns, Hayden Carruth, Raymond Carver, Billy Collins, Wendy Cope, e.e. cummings, Roy Daniells, Emily Dickinson (and you'll find a lot of her in here), Tom Disch, Stephen Dobyns, Stephen Dunn, Ralph Waldo Emerson, B.H. Fairchild, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Robert Frost, Erica-Lynn Gambino, Deborah Garrison, Dana Gioia, Linda Gregg, Donald Hall, Robert Hass, Seamus Heaney, Geof Hewitt, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Langston Hughes, Randall Jarrell, Erica Jong, Donald Justice, X.J. Kennedy, Jane Kenyon, Galway Kinnell, Maxine Kumin, Stanley Kunitz, D.H. Lawrence, Li-Young Lee, Ursula Leguin, Denise Levertov, April Lindner, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Thomas Lux, Walt McDonald, Herman Melville, William Meredith, W.S. Merwin, Robert Mezey, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Frederick Morgan, Howard Moss, Lisa Mueller, James B(all) Naylor, Howard Nemerov, Frank O'Hara, Sharon Olds, Linda Pastan, Robert Phillips, Theodore Roethke, Kenneth Rexroth, Kay Ryan, May Sarton, Anne Sexton, William Shakespeare, Charles Simic, Louis Simpson, Gary Snyder, William Stafford, Wallace Stevens, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joyce Sutphen, May Swenson, Sara Teasdale, Henry David Thoreau, John Updike, Walt Whitman, Richard Wilbur, Oscar Wilde, C.K. Williams, Hugo Williams, William Carlos Williams, James Wright, W.B. Yeats	2004-08-12
interesting	Fenton's Intro to English Poetry is an interesting book to read, but not because it will teach you anything. It is too short. He covers just about everything, but each chapter (which covers a different topic) is only a couple of pages long. He just doesn't go into it enough. This book is not for teaching. This book is not for beginners. What this book is for is for those who know what they are doing or have an idea and are interested in what Fenton has to say. And it is interesting.	2004-08-12
pretty good vietnam novel	I'm going to say, despite the lackluster title (which is pretty dull and doesn't draw anyone in), this is a pretty good book.<br />Carl Melcher Goes To Vietnam was originally published as an e-book and was short-listed (along with such high profile authors as Joyce Carol Oates and David McCullough) for the Frankfurt E-Book Award. <br />It's a pretty good book. There is something familiar about the novel. But that is because, like all good stories, it feels like coming home, to use an old cliche. It has well drawn characters, and Clayton very skillfully draws you into the drama of his people. The one weakness of the book is a slight predictability. Many times you are able to see things coming long before they happen, but still, the journey is fun, even if you know the outcome. It isn't like most Vietnam novels, and I'd recommend it.	2004-07-19
POTTER!!!!	Harry Potter is the pop culture phenomenon that has gotten children to read again. And it really is a well-written, wonderful series. Quite engaging for both young and old. In fact, I sometimes wonder of those of us a bit older might be getting more from the books. As the series goes on, the books become increasingly complex (and long). This Potter book is 800 pages, but after the first couple of chapters, they just fly by as the story, intricate, complex and drawn out pulls you in. This is by far the best book in the series, and while I wouldn't stand in line for hours at midnight to buy it, I would recommend this book.	2004-07-14
good collection	First of all, you have to realize Dana Gioia isn't just an average American talking about British poetry. It isn't like, say me for example. Gioia is extremely well informed and knows what he is talking about. So you get a really good collection of essays. But that is what this is, just a collection of essays that are only connected by the fact that they discuss British poets. Now don't get me wrong, these are great essays and you can't go wrong reading them, I just wish that Gioia had rewritten them to make them more cohesive as a whole, to really give us a picture of British poetry. Several of the essays were just reviews of books, and the Larkin essay was a review of Andrew Motion's biography of Larkin. Gioia would have done better to have discussed Larkin, Burgess, Ted Hughes, Amis, Dick David, Gunn, etc, like his opening essay (The Barrier of a Common Language: New British Poetry in the Eighties) and his essay on Fenton and Causley. These are well written and good essay/reviews. I just think that we would have been better served by something that was more cohesive and not just a collection of previously published essays and reviews. Still, they are good.	2004-07-08
weak first collection	Vanessa Haley's first collection of poems is a rather weak one. The language is more or less uneventful and flat and the poems are unremarkable. That isn't to say that there is nothing good about this collection. The opening poem, about a photograph of her mother, is a really good poem (which gave me high hopes for the rest of the collection) and there is a great poem on the death of her cousin, &quot;For My Cousin, Found in a Ravine&quot;. But there are so many better collections of poetry you can pick up instead.	2004-06-25
solid collection	Yezzi's collection is a pretty solid collection. It isn't one of those collections that makes your stomach drop, but it is an enjoyable one to read, one that you are sure to find poems to love (without a doubt you'll get a kick out of \\"Upon Julia's (...)\\" and I also really enjoyed \\"Woman Holding a Fox\\" and the title poem).	2004-06-25
stunning first book	While not as good as her second or third book (she really grew as a poet), Rhina Espaillat's first book is a great debut. She has mastered meter and rhyme and does it so seemlessly and beautifully you don't even notice it happening. You also find a few poems in her native Spanish (untranslated). And some simple drawings, also by the poet. Espaillat is one of my favorite poets and this is a worthy collection by her.	2004-06-25
Espaillat's weakest book	This is Rhina Espaillat's longest and weakest collection of poetry. Following three great books of poetry, she has produced a work that is simply not up to the standard I have become used to seeing from her. The poems are not as original nor is the language quite as seemless or beautiful. Not that there aren't some good poems (&quot;To Diana&quot; and &quot;Shop Talk&quot; are among the best she has written), but this just isn't what I've come to expect from an Espaillat collection.	2004-06-25
sort of an american wendy cope	Gail White has mastered the formal poem. Gail White has mastered the shorter lyric. Gail White has mastered the use of humor. Gail White is sort of an American Wendy Cope, only funny. If you like some humor in your poetry, and who doesn't, then pick this collection up, you won't be disappointed.	2004-06-24
disappoints	I trust the Richard Wilbur Award books. Generally they are great books (for example, books from A.E. Stallings, Rhina P. Espaillat, and A.M. Juster). And I expected Carper's book to be another one of the great ones, after all, it is mostly sonnets, and I love sonnets. But I found that though they were technically well-written sonnets they didn't hold the magic that truly wonderful poetry contains. There were some good poems in the book, and I thought there were three great poems: &quot;Why Did The&quot; was hilarious; &quot;Flypaper&quot;; and &quot;A Late Rembrandt Self-Portrait&quot;--I could see it, you knew just exactly which one Carper was writing about. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy this book, but I'm not going to recommend it either.	2004-06-24
one of the greatest poetry collections	After the Library of America edition of Robert Frost's poetry, this might be the best collection of poetry there is. Not only is Hardy one of the best poets ever (easily top five in the English language), but Mezey does a great job at putting together this collection. He selects the best of Hardy's poetry and a highly representative selection as well. His introduction is very well written and highly informative. It's like taking a quick class on Hardy. The poems are very much annotated, almost too much, but the notes are at the back of the book, so they are unobtrusive. There is a chronology and Mezey includes a few quotes, some of them quite witty, from Hardy. And all for an affordable price. You really can't beat this, and Hardy is one of those poets that should be on everyone's shelf.<br />A quick list of my favorite Hardy poems: Hap; Neutral Tones; At a Hasty Wedding; The Last Chrysanthemum; The Darkling Thrush; Mad Judy; The Ruined Maid; The Man He Killed; Channel Firing; Ah, Are You Digging on My Grave?; Without Ceremony; The Haunter; The Voice; His Visitor; She Charged Me; At Tea; Over the Coffin; In the Moonlight; Near Lanivet, 1872; Something Tapped; The Ballet; A Backward Spring; At a Country Fair; A Night in November.	2004-06-24
stunning debut	This is a reprint of Fairchild's impressive first collection. He didn't make any changes in the poems. You get some real stunning poems like &quot;The Men&quot; and &quot;Kansas Avenue&quot; in here. It isn't The Art of the Lathe, but you can see the genesis of Fairchild's impressive talent here.	2004-06-24
a beautiful collection	The Walt McDonald First Book Winner is one of those awards that I watch for. One of my favorite books of poetry (April Lindner's Skin) won it. And now another winner has become one of my favorites. Catherine Tufariello has written a wonderful and beautiful book. It is a collection of formal poetry that shows a mastery of someone that you would have expected to have been writing much longer than she has. The book is divided into five sections. Section one contains seven well written poems. Section two contains several of my favorite poems. &quot;Snow Angel&quot; is a wonderfully written villanelle (which is difficult to do well). &quot;The Mirror&quot; is a sonnet that deals with divorce is such an original way. &quot;Ghost Children,&quot; another sonnet, takes on the inability to have children--describing the features of their unconceived children in such beautiful language that you can picture the child and mourn its loss. It's a masterful poem. One of my favorites, &quot;Keeping My Name,&quot; takes on the issue of her last name, and it is a mouthful. After all the seriousness we've had, this bit of lightness falls in perfectly here. Section three are translations of Cavalcanti, Guinizelli, and Petrarch. Section four starts with Lorenzo Lotto's Annunciation and then goes into a series of biblical poems, several of which (&quot;No Angel,&quot; &quot;Rebekah I,&quot; and &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;) are truly some of her best work. It's really a great collection of poetry and after reading it, it has become one of my favorite collections, one I'm recommending to everyone I talk to.	2004-06-24
a narrative joy	This book has the daunting task of trying to follow Fairchild's collection The Art of the Lathe, and I don't know that anyone could follow a collection that good, but Early Occult Memory Systems is a good try--it is a strong collection. It's longer than your normal poetry collection. It contains two of my favorite Fairchild poems, &quot;Brazil,&quot; and &quot;Rave On.&quot; And the centerpiece of this collection is Fairchild's long narrative &quot;The Blue Buick,&quot; which truly shines at some points. With this collection Fairchild proves again what kind of phenomenal poet he is.	2004-06-24
nothing special	This collections starts off with a great line: &quot;The sea comes in like nothing but the sea&quot; and the poem that follows is an ok poem. The problem is that that ok poem is the best poem in the book. And it is a problem when an &quot;ok poem&quot; is the best poem you've got. Now, don't get me wrong, Maxwell can write a good poem. I've heard him read from his next collection, and it is some good work. But the poems in _The Nerve_ are weak and not very spectacular. They are too quiet for lack of a better word. Maxwell can do better than this. Let's just hope he does.	2004-06-24
great book	The Richard Wilbur Award usually signifies a good collection of poetry, and A.M. Juster's book is no exception, in fact, it is a really good collection of poetry. Juster has mastered the sonnet and shorter poem, but where he really shined here was his long narrative, &quot;The Secret Language of Women,&quot; which is such a phenomenal poem. It's really one of the better narratives I've read recently. This is definitely one of those collections you want to add to your poetry shelf.	2004-06-24
what happened	What happened here? Fennelly's debut collection of poetry was one of the best collections I have read. It was really phenomenal, so when I heard that her new collection came out, I got very excited and ran out and bought it. Then I read it. This is really a bad book. The language is flat. It is syrupy. And I know children are a joy, but for crying out loud, find a new topic. It's not that they were pretty much all (with one or two exceptions) motherhood poems, it's that they were bad motherhood poems. No, avoid this book and go grab Open Houses if you don't already have it. This collection is really a disappointment.	2004-06-17
the best potter yet	Rowling's longest thus far in the series is the best so far. It is the most fleshed out and has the most detailed and intricate plot.	2004-06-06
waited for this	Ever since I read Mason's The Country I Remember, I've been anxiously waiting for his next collection of poems, and finally it is here, _Arrivals_. While it doesn't have anything as ambitious as &quot;The Country I Remember,&quot; it does have one of the best poems Mason has written, &quot;New Zealand Letter,&quot; in fact the best poem he's written outside of his great narrative. This book is also loaded with many other short gems, such as &quot;The City,&quot; and &quot;Winter 1963&quot; which is a great poem dealing with both the deaths of Robert Frost and Sylvia Plath. And it has one of the best things that Mason has ever written, his narrative &quot;The Collector's Tale.&quot; This poem alone is worth buying the collection for. This is a wonderful collection of poetry.	2004-06-05
Well done Ms. Rowling, well done.	While I'm not sure I'd say this addition to the Potter saga is as good as the first or second book, it has to be close. It is a well written, highly entertaining story with plenty of twists and turns, and I'll be honest, it gripped me enough that I finished it in a single day. Well done Ms. Rowling, well done.	2004-06-04
a cult classic	This book could be called nothing other than a cult classic. It inspired one of the greatest films of all times (another cult classic), and while it isn't as good as the movie, it is a pretty great book. Full of satire, political commentary and philosophy. A book well worth reading.	2004-05-29
informative collection	Gwynn has put together an entertaining, well-written and highly informative collection of essays on the New Expansive movement in poetry. If you are interested in narrative or formal poetry, either in reading or writing it, then this is a great collection to read. It is a revision of the earlier Feirstein edition, one that is much more up to date. <br />There's Dana Gioia's wonderful essay \\"Notes on the New Formalism\\" (also found in his Can Poetry Matter) and his great essay on \\"The Dilemma of the Long Poem.\\" Other essays on the narrative come from Dick Allen, Frederick Feirsein, Christopher Clausen and Thomas M. Disch. Mark Jarman's essay on Robinson, Frost and Jeffers is included as is the phenomenal essay by Dave Mason \\"Other Lives: On Shorter Narrative Poems.\\" Which might be the best essay in the book and a definite must to read. You'll also find the introductions from Annie Finch's A Formal Feeling Comes which includes such poets such as Rita Dove, Marilyn Hacker, Marilyn Nelson, and Mary Jo Salter among others. Tim Steele has an essay in here, which later became a chapter in his remarkable book Missing Measures. There are also essays by Keith Maillard, Meg Schoerke, Wyatt Prunty, Paul Lake (always a joy to read), Robert McPhillips, and Brad Leithauser's great essay \\"Metrical Illiteracy.\\" In fact the only weak essay contained is the idiotic \\"The Neural Lyre\\" by Frederick Turner and Ernst Poppel. Schocking that even they could believe what they write. Still, Gwynn points out in his introduction that he has trouble resolving himself to all contained in the essays but all the essays contained are influential in one way or another. For those interested in contemporary poetry, this is one of those books on prosody that should be read.	2004-04-25
3 1/2 stars	I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting out of this book, but I almost got it. This is my first Palahniuk novel. I haven't read Fight Club yet (though I've seen the movie and it is one of my favorites). It's an interestingly dysfunctional novel with some of the most interestingly dysfunctional characters. But there is little cohesion to the story. Some of the most interesting episodes we only get the beginning of and Palahniuk doesn't finish other than in telling us later rather than showing us at the time. The characters tend to be irritating and as a whole the story is a bit unbelievable. It's a good effort that falls just a bit short.	2004-04-25
beautiful	This is beautiful work. I hate to use cliche words, but Jacobik writes with a gracefulness and musicality (and music is everywhere) that makes her poetry a true joy to read.	2004-04-18
solid collection	Baker's collection of poems is a pretty good collection. Not a particularly great one, but one that is good and worth reading, especially the first section which contains two phenomenal poems: <BR>&quot;Piano Music&quot;<BR>From two storie sup in the visible traces of rain, <BR>the still steam of the city washed our window<BR>with a blue brush...<br />see, it starts so wonderful.<br />and: <BR>&quot;Abandoned Depot, Canada Geese&quot;<BR>so black was the night sky that the handful<BR>of stars only increased its dark pressure.<br />wonderful those two poems are.	2004-04-15
what was he thinking	I'm not quite sure what Eliot was thinking when he wrote this particular set of verse, and coming from such a 'serious' poet as he was. I suppose that regardless of the quality of the poetry, it is still important to read because Eliot himself is important in the canon. But I have to wonder. It gets rather sing songy at times and there doesn't seem to be much technical mastery to the poem. And I hated the subject matter.	2004-04-06
GREAT	Here we have Uncanny X-Men #145-161. We have Starjammers, Dr. Doom, and all sort of goodie. I just wish it would have been in color.	2004-04-02
good bio on sylvia plath	This is one of the better biographies of Sylvia Plath (as is the Wagner-Martin biography, though Stevenson is much more thorough). Supposedly Stevenson comes down on the side of Ted Hughes, but to me the biography seems objective and fair. Even in those biographies written to make Plath look like a victim, she still comes across as tempermental and difficult to live around. I think Stevenson's biography is fair, if at times a bit ponderous to read. I'd suggest Silent Woman as a companion piece (it's a biography of Stevenson's biography). Bitter Fame has three appendices--memoirs of Sylvia written by others--Lucas Myers, Dido Merwin, and Richard Murphy. You get a sense of dread as you approach Dido's little memoir. I'm sure Plath was difficult and I'm sure Dido has her reasons, but you get the impression that she wrote her memoir just to 'get back at' Plath. To show her up so to speak, even though its tone isn't much different then what else you'll find in the book. Anyway, regardless of what type of person Sylvia Plath was, difficult or not, you cannot deny her genius, which is far greater than those who she came in contact with or have written about her.	2004-03-27
a wonderful kind of strange	Schickler's collection of stories are strange, but in a wonderful way. They are slightly surreal and absurd, but still believeable in an out there kind of way. Schickler's voice is one that draws the reader in to his world, and I look forward to reading more of his work. <br />The stories in Kissing in Manhattan (which is a wonderful title for the book--I can't think of anything more appropriate) all center around one odd apartment building, Preemption, and the main characters and events of one story are secondary to the next. The best story in the collection is \\"The Smoker,\\" which is an odd sort of love story that first appeared in The New Yorker and then later in the O. Henry Awards. All the stories in this collection relate to love, or sex at the very least. There is the very touching \\"Jacob's Bath\\" and \\"Telling It All to Otis.\\" \\"Kissing in Manhattan\\" is a very strange sexual tale that contains no sex. One of the weak spots of the collection is \\"Duty,\\" which is the only story that is told in first person. It is an interesting story, but it is a bit jarring to go from a certain distance between reader and narrator and then to jump in this close. It's a good story, but Schickler should have trusted the voice and distance that worked so well for the other stories. The other weak spot was the final story \\"The Green Balloon.\\" Even though all the stories in the collection relate to each other (and they add to each other by reading each other), they can be taken as seperate stories. With the exception of the final story. It wraps up events from other stories and you can't understand it or truly enjoy it without having read several of the other stories. Still, this is a great collection from one of American letters' great new voices.	2004-03-22
a useful book	The NA book is quite a useful book for those who need it. It comes from the AA text and a need for a text specifically for drugs. I found it isn't quite as dry reading, and for those who have a drug problem, more pertinant than the AA book alone, though you should supplement the NA text with the AA text. If you or someone you know has a problem with drugs, this book is an absolute must to have.	2004-03-21
one of those scifi classics	The Forever War is one of those science fiction classics that we all know and love. It is similar to Heinlein's Starship Troopers (and as good as FW is, it doesn't hit that divine exquisiteness that ST does) in that it is an anti-war novel that is written in a very socio-philosophical/political way. This book takes on every way war can possibly affect life, and a few ways we haven't thought of yet. It is a wonderful book. Enjoy it.	2004-03-21
a short story master	Bobbie Ann Mason is one of the modern masters of the short story, and to see why all you have to do is pick up this collection. The stories all have a melancholy feel and are simple stories of rural Kentucky. They do at times tend to be very similar, so it is best to break this collection up with something else. But reading this shows you the skill Mason has with the short story, and why so many students love her work. I especially loved the touching story &quot;Drawing Names.&quot;	2004-03-20
The gripping conclusion	This is a fitting conclusion to one of the best stories I've seen. Gotham destroyed in an earthquake, cut off from the rest of the world (no one in, no one out), fought over by various gangs, led by the police, super villains and the Batman himself. The series has been loaded with drama, suspense, action, great art--all in all you have to love it.	2004-03-16
highly original	Exiles is a highly original series. It is sort of a Quantum Leap X-Men. You get various X-Men from different realities/dimensions or what have you. They come together to fix something that has gone wrong in different dimensions (just like Quantum Leap). The charactes are original and interesting as are the stories. I love the art. All in all, this is really good.	2004-03-16
new x-men #13-18	Millar keeps up the high quality of storytelling he has shown us so far. I really don't know what else to say that hasn't been said already.	2004-03-16
weak art	I found the art in this book to be rather weak. It wasn't bad, but nothing real great. The story on the other hand is a pretty good one. It really goes into the psychology and guilt of Banner. What would it be like if you had a monster inside? And it has a killer ending.	2004-03-16
Ultimate War	Here we have two new Marvel creations meeting and fighting: The Ultimate X-Men and the Ultimates. The art is back up to par in this book. The story still as strong as the previous books. Even this far along they've kept it fresh.	2004-03-16
a new breed of x-men	The Ultimate line is what Marvel created to try to bring new readers to Marvel. They created a great story here populated with characters that are familiar as well as fresh. I also liked the art. If you want to jump in at the beginning of the X-Men, this is a great new place to start. If you are an old fan, this is a great addition to what we already know and love.	2004-03-16
great	While the art is still at the same level, the story is my favorite of all the volumes. There are more twists and surprises. It makes you think. It is a great story.	2004-03-16
Vol 3	This latest volume is fitting with what we have seen Bruce Jones produce. You've got a great story with some really good turns within. The art is still of good quality. I hope they can keep it going.	2004-03-16
the beginning	This is the beginning of a great new story arc. After the great earthquake, seen in Cataclysm, Gotham is cut off from the outside world. No one in, no one out. Now it is ruled by gangs and our hero, The Dark Knight is missing in action. You've got the first two parts of this arc, and it is gripping.	2004-03-16
well done	This is a really well done book. I've been away from the comics for some time now, so I'm not sure what's been going on, but it is easy to pick this volume up and be back into it just that easy. They have a great new look and I love the uniforms. It's all very well written and the art is great as well. They keep you interested in the story.	2004-03-16
not the best	This isn't the best of the X-Men I've been reading lately. Claremont has produced some of the greatest X-Men stories of all time, but here he falls short. Their time in the Savage Land gives an okay story, maybe one that would be really good if it were someone other than Claremont. The other X-Treme X-Men that I've read are pretty good though.	2004-03-16
Gotham's darkest hour	This continues the storyline of the battle for the ruined Gotham. It's a well told tale.	2004-03-16
Vol 2	The Bruce Jones story line continues here. And it is just as good as in the previous volume. The story and art continue its level of quality and this one, like volume one, has some nice turns to it.	2004-03-16
Vol 1	Great beginning for the Bruce Jones story arc. Great story. Great art. Good for all Hulk fans.	2004-03-16
should have kept the old beginning	I just really couldn't get into this. The characters aren't sympathetic. I'll admit the story is original, though not real great. The mutants aren't all that interesting--neither look or power wise. Wolverine makes a brief appearance, though nothing spectacular. This just didn't draw me in the way X-books usually do. I wish they hadn't changed it.	2004-03-16
Claremont does it again	Claremont takes some of our favorite X-Men characters and gives them a make over. What he creates is a fresh story for us. Remember, the X-Men have been around, in various forms, for quite a while and they need a shake up every now again. Great story, great art. Read it.	2004-03-16
level of quality still tops	Grant Morrison has bred new life into the X-Men. The stories and characters are fleshed out, fresh, and kept interesting. I love what has been done here. The art is still as good as in the previous volumes.	2004-03-16
New X-Men #118-126	The quality keeps going on here. The X-Men are still very fresh and interesting in this volume. The story still great. The art still good. The New X-Men stories are much more character driven than what I remember.	2004-03-16
uneven	I found this Cable book to be pretty uneven. Sometimes it was really good, sometimes not so much. The art stayed pretty much the same throughout, somewhere in the middle of good and bad. There was a pretty good no dialogue issue contained within as well as some notes at the end. I'd only recommend this for the Cable fan.	2004-03-16
great followup	What we have here is a great follow up to vol one of the Ultimate X-Men. We introduce more characters and get this new take on the Weapon X story. Well done story at that. Still gets high marks for art and character.	2004-03-16
Gotham in ruins	This is the second volume of the No Man's Land story, where Gotham lies in ruins, cut off from the outside world, battled over by gangs (including the police), and Batman and his team fight for the good of Gotham. It's a gripping storyline.	2004-03-16
still going strong	This contains New X-Men #21-25. And it is still going strong. The story is well written with great characters. The art is a little spotty here, but it is such a great story that that can be forgiven.	2004-03-16
one of kerouac's finest	I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool. I can't recommend it enough.	2004-03-16
disapoints	This is supposed to be one of those classic Marvel storylines. You can tell they were trying to write it that way. And it does have some interesting moments (turning Wolverine to rubber) but as a whole it isn't just that great. You get a lot of minor characters who are all powerful doing major things. It's just not that great of a story.	2004-03-15
a Claremont classic	The Fall of the Mutants is another one of Chris Claremont's classic stories. It takes place when the original X-Men have formed X-Force and Wolverine leads the X-Men. Storm and Forge are elsewhere. And this is when the supposed death of the X-Men happens. Very good for those of us who remember it and those who are new to it.	2004-03-15
I rather liked it	I found this collection to be rather enjoyable. It is a good story, though it does weaken at parts. And on the whole, the artwork was pretty good. I don't really see what there is to complain about.	2004-03-15
pretty good	I love it when they team up The Hulk and Wolverine--they are two of my favorite characters. And they usually manage to keep it an interesting story, which they do here. They've got six hours to rescue a sick boy from drug dealers. I will say the artwork is real uneven. And as an added bonus, they've tacked on the issue of The Hulk where Wolverine makes his first appearance. Don't that just take you back.	2004-03-15
pretty good	What you've got is a good story with good art. All I can really say about it is that if you like the Hulk or Todd McFarlane you should get this.	2004-03-15
bring down Gotham	What we have here is a major earthquake that pretty much destroys Gotham. You get to see what Batman and company would do in the face of a major natural disaster. On a scale that we've never seen (after all, they do close it off). It's a great story with really good art. It helps keep Batman from becoming stale.	2004-03-15
i liked it	This storyline I wasn't aware of until I came across this TPB in a bookstore. And I'm glad I did because it is a great story with one of my favorite characters starring in it. And I loved the artwork. I'd love to see more books done like this.	2004-03-15
classic	This is another one of those classic comic storylines: The Dark Phoenix Saga and the death of Jean Grey. There really isn't much more you can say than that. If you are familiar with it you know how great it is. And for you recent X-fans, those that aren't familiar with it, it is one of the classic stories and one that if you haven't read yet, you're not really that much of a fan.	2004-03-15
what happened	I want to know what happened here. You've got two of the coolest comic book characters (outside of Marvel): Batman and Spawn. This should have been great. But it was hampered with a weak story and minimal contact between our two superheros. Even the artwork wasn't that great. Come on guys--you could have done better.	2004-03-15
uncanny x-men #416-420	First of all, the artwork is pretty weak. That being said, I liked the story. We've got werewolves here that give the X-Men a good run. There are some great little twists and turns in here. And it is interesting to watch the Juggernaught fight on the side of the X-Men. Other than the art, it's pretty great.	2004-03-15
really for Wonder Woman fans	I'll start off by admitting that I'm not a huge fan of DC comics--other than Batman. And I'm not really a Wonder Woman person (and this is a WW story). But this really was alright. It is a story of betrayal and has an interesting philosophical/morality bent to it. It has dragons. Good writing. And an interesting artwork--almost painterly.	2004-03-15
uncanny x-men 394-399	I'm not real sure what to say about this colletion. It's a middle of the road story. Not real great, but not real bad. It brings up some issues, but never really deals with them. The art is good except for #398. I guess the hard core fan would like it.	2004-03-15
overall pretty good	Just when you thought you had seen it all, Marvel does this. They've taken some of our favorite characters and turned magna on them. And you've got some of the best here. The Hulk has one of the more interesting changes--he's become a huge Godzilla-like creature, and he is what threads the stories together. The Spider-Man story is a good one. Keeps the basics and turns it samuri like. Really well done. Everyone's favorite, the X-Men are here. They are real uneven. I think a better job could have been done on them (Their Wolverine is really weak). Iron Man has recieved an update and is inhabited by Ms. Stark. And Stark Industries threads some minor Marvel characters into the story. Dr. Strange has been turned into a much cooler character than he ever has been before. The Avengers have become the Iron Avengers (a Power Ranger type team) consisting of Captain, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Vision. They combine to become Ultimate Iron Man. And they battle Apocalypse (who has a much better look) and his Horsemen: Sinister, Juggernaut, White QUeen, and Archangel, and theirs is a good transformation. America, Nemo is an megalomaniac leader of Atlantis bent on taking over the surface world. The Fantastic Four have been given a real interesting change, one that I'm not quite sure how to describe. Ghost Rider, who I normally don't like, gets an interesting theological bent and turns into a good story. The Punisher is weak. Real weak. I won't even go into her other than this: S&amp;M. And even Thor, mostly unchanged, makes a brief appearance. <br />I'll say this, it was interesting, and as a whole, quite enjoyable.	2004-03-15
a Claremont classic	Here we have another of Chris Claremont's classic X-Men stories. Here you have the X-Men we are all familiar with, including Wolverine, Beast, Rogue, Gambit, Psylock, and Cyclcops. This is the first few volumes of the Claremont created X-Men series that happened in the 90s. Very good work in here. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys anything X-Men related.	2004-03-15
a good wolverine collection	I found this to be a good Wolverine story. Good art. A lot of fun to read. That is until #186, which is the Punisher story that just seems to be tacked on for no real good reason (oh there is a slight connection--feeble though). And it is drawn like some (bad) Saturday morning cartoon. It's the only weakness in an otherwise good book.	2004-03-15
uncanny x-men #410-415	I liked this story. There's a good tension that runs through it as well as a thread of hope (which explains the title). It's got some interesting twists in it. And the art is good.	2004-03-15
the beginning	This is a must for X-fans. This is the story of the beginning of the X-Men. Not X-Men #1, but what came before. How the professor got the original team. It's really well-done.	2004-03-15
it was interesting	It was interesting to see this new take on some old favorite characters--Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Wasp, and Giant-Man. And surprisingly Wasp and Giant-Man's story was one of the more interesting ones. It's pretty well done.	2004-03-15
it was ok	This was ok. It was really a Spider-Man collection. The first story teams him with Wolverine fighting Sabertooth. It was pretty good. The second story has Hulk in it. They fight--more or less evenly. It was a good story. The third story teams him with Iron Man. It's not such a good story. And it is drawn kind of cartoony.	2004-03-15
a Claremont classic	I remember when Inferno happened. It was one of my favorite comic storylines of all time. So I was real happy when I found this TPB that collected it all in one (rather thick) volume. It's one of those classic X-Men stories. Inferno also bled over into several other comics and I wish they had been included here (or maybe Marvel will release a companion volume that contains them)--those like Spider Man, Daredevil, and the X-Terminators. Still, even with just the X-Men and The New Mutants, it is a must have volume.	2004-03-15
mediocre	Over the years, Batman is one of the few comics that I've stayed interested in (and the only DC), but I really didn't think Gauntlet was that great. It's Robin's right of passage, but the storyline is only mediocre. And even the art isn't that great. But I still like Batman.	2004-03-15
interesting	I'm not much of a DC fan and I am a big fan of Marvel, so I thought that this would be interesting, getting to see Stan Lee &quot;create&quot; the classic DC characters. And it was interesting if not great. I think he did a great job with Batman, though he's the one DC character that needs no tweaking. The Wonder Woman story was pretty interesting, though not something I'd want to see a whole lot of (though certainly better than her original version). His Superman was weak. There isn't a whole lot you can do to change Superman, so Stan Lee was sort of doomed from the start. His Green Lantern was basically Silver Surfer. Beside what can you do with Green Lantern. It was all very interesting though.	2004-03-15
classic	This is one of the classic Wolverine stories. It's Chris Claremont and Frank Miller teamed together--and that alone should tell you how great this is. I remember when it came out in the original 4 part limited series (which I have). It's great. And now with this TPB I don't have to reread the original comic books and risk damaging them. And have I mentioned that this series is great?	2004-03-15
from the WB's series	If you liked the WB series X-Men: Evolution (which was rather well done) you'll enjoy this as well. It covers the origin of all the characters. That is, how Prof. X found all of them. It's a nice start to the comic series.	2004-03-15
a must have	The Weapon X story is a classic. It is one of the greatest Marvel stories told. And it is all collected here in one inexpensive volume. If you like the X-Men, if you like Wolverine, or if you just like comic books, you should have this.	2004-03-15
classic	The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's classic novels or novella or story, whatever you want to call it. Many consider it to be his finest work (it played a big part in his winning of the Nobel Prize). I put it with his finest work, like A Farewell to Arms, though his best work is found in The Complete Short Stories, The Sun Also Rises, and The Garden of Eden.<br />The novella carries a tone of depression and tiredness and a feeling of religiousity. Many have pointed out the Christ-image of the story, and make no mistake, it is there. The story divides itself into three parts of the narrative. Before he goes to sea, the battle with the fish (which is the bulk of the narrative) and the fight with the sharks--where much of the Christ symbolism kicks in. The novella is written in the type of prose we have come to associate with Hemingway: that of the tough, terse declarative prose. This is truly a classic.<br />What I wish most about this novella is that it was included in The Complete Short Stories, where it truly belongs. With the greats. To truly appreciate it read it as the ending of The Complete Short Stories.	2004-03-14
a late masterpiece	The Garden of Eden is one of Hemingway's unpublished manuscripts. Though he worked on it for something like fifteen years, he never completed it, or at least to his satisfaction. But even in its 'incomplete' state, it is one of my favorite books. I can only imagine what it would have been like had he lived long enough to finish it to his satisfaction--another The Sun Also Rises perhaps. Still, even though the manuscript claims to be incomplete it has a solid flow of story, and pretty polished off. And while the ending isn't typically Hemingway, it is a strong ending. In fact, there isn't much about this book that is typical Hemingway. It's much closer and much more complex than the other Hemingway pieces I've read. It's more emotional. The prose flows more and has a lyrical quality. It's a sensuous story of love, sex, emotion, and madness. It's not the first Hemingway I'd start with, but definitely one of the first few you should read. It will help solidify your respect for the author.	2004-03-13
An American Classic	This is a straightforward tale told in simple straightforward language about the love (brotherly) and dreams of two men, George and the simple Lennie. It's a beautiful story and few written can equal it.	2004-03-13
no Gatsby, but still good	Tender is the Night is no Gatsby (though what is), but it is still an important novel. It is more personal than the other of Fitzgerald's work and covers happy days in France through the madness and alcoholism that follows. As great as this novel was, there were some weaknesses. It did seem to get weaker as it went along. Part One is the best, Part Two is weaker and weakens as it goes along. And Part Three is the weakest of all--even Fitzgerald himself admitted that. Still, it is well written and you can see why Fitzgerald is an American classic.	2004-03-13
a magical experience	Now, I love Hemingway. What I've read of him has been great, but I found The Sun Also Rises to be a wondrous experience while reading it (as I did The Complete Short Stories). Perhaps I should have waited before writing this review as I am still struck dumb by the sparse beauty of Hemingway's prose. This is a tender, absorbing, gripping story of a group of American and British expatriats and their vacation in Spain for the bullfights and festivals. This has become one of my favorite books.	2004-03-11
well written essay	As far as I know, Donaghy's well-written is only available in the UK. Which is truly a shame since it is a really good essay on poetry. It's scholarly without being stuffy and Donaghy's sense of humor seeps in but never overpowers the essay. And you'll be surprised with what all Donaghy has to say.	2004-03-09
great book on the biography and sylvia plath	Malcolm has written a great book on the difficulties of writing a good and fair biography. She uses Sylvia Plath, and specifically Anne Stevenson's Bitter Fame as her example. What you get here is an interesting book that engages the reader and at times almost reads like a novel. The book is gripping and before you know it, you've finished it. Also, Malcolm claims to be on the &quot;side&quot; of Ted Hughes, but I still think she gives a fairly balanced view of the whole situation. But, this isn't a biography of Sylvia Plath. This is a biography of a biography.	2004-03-08
one of our important confessional poets	Anne Sexton has secured her place as one of our most important confessional poets (though I prefer Plath and Lowell over her work) and an important feminist poet. Her poems are polished, but still give that feeling of rawness. It's a good combination. Her later work is rather weak, but the work from her early and middle periods is excellent.	2004-03-08
about rave culture	The first thing I noticed about this book was its inconsistency. At times Reynolds writes interestingly, but often his style borders on dull. There are some great passages in here. This book covers electronic music, ecstasy, and rave culture. He covers the history as well. I wouldn't say that this is the definitive book on the subject, but well worth a glance through.	2004-03-08
reissued and expanded	Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Richard Aldington, Amy Lowell--all those most associated with the Imagist movement, the leaders of the movement are in this anthology, as well as some poets you don't quite expect (such as Carl Sandburg, e.e. cummings &amp; Wallace Stevens). Also within these pages are T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Marianne MooreT.E. Hulme, F.S. Flint, Archibald MacLeish, John Gould Fletcher, Herbert Read, Max Michelson, and Adelaide Crapsey. This is an important anthology because of how important the Imagist movement, and the poets involved in it, was to the creation of modern poetry. Pratt explains it best in his essay/introduction to the anthology. Which is yet another reason to pick up this book, Pratt's essay is truly one of the best about the Imagism. I can't recommend this enough.	2004-03-03
juvenile but has potential	I found O'Brien's first collection to be a bit juvenile--a lot like what you would find in a creative writing workshop. Okay, but not something you'd expect to see in book form. But I think O'Brien has a lot of potential to develop as a writer. He has some talent, now he needs to perfect his craft. Which is one of the things publishing in magazines and journals does, lets you know if your work is up to the 'standards' of being published. But on to the book.<br />One of the negatives of this book were the 'interviews' which felt like fillers, as if he had to reach a certain page count and this was his 'cute' way of filling in the missing pages (and please, don't patronize us with a not at the end, those who didn't realize it was fiction probably shouldn't be allowed to read grown up books). &quot;The Writer&quot; which is the opening story had some potential, but in the end fell flat. O'Brien seems to have been trying to write some sort of parable but it didn't pull itself together at all. I'll admit &quot;How About This&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot; I didn't even finish reading. They were that bad. <br />That isn't to say that there weren't some positives because there were. &quot;How to Survive New England Weather&quot; is workshop fiction but it is good workshop fiction. And I fully didn't expect to like &quot;Existential Dilemma&quot; at all, but it turned out to be rather interesting. But on to the true gems of this collection. &quot;Dinner With Caitlin McRay&quot; is a charming story about a friendship with a woman with bulemia. And &quot;Toby Grey&quot; is the best story in the collection. It's a teen angst/coming of age story that I have little bad to say about. &quot;Dinner&quot; and &quot;Toby Grey&quot; are really the two stories in the collection that O'Brien should have kept and made sure the rest were up to their quality. But he shows potential and I'd gladly read more by him, if only to see how he develops as a writer.	2004-03-03
Poems for Paula	Fred Morgan's second to last book is, like all his other books, dedicated to his wife and co-editor of The Hudson Review, Paula Dietz. But this book more than the others is a tribute to his love for his wife. That being said, most of the poems in this collection are pretty weak. The only one I found any interesting was the opening poem. If you want to pick up a collection of Morgan's poetry, go with his latest collection, The Abiding One.	2004-02-29
a really good collection	The One Abiding is Morgan's best book of poetry. There are several poems throughout the book that are quite good and &quot;Washington Square&quot; is a brilliant poem itself. I found this book to be stronger than Morgan's Selected and Poems for Paula and stronger than The Night Sky, which I did like.	2004-02-29
great anthology	This is a great anthology. The best you are going to find unless you go with one of the giant anthologies. This one is cheaper and definitely less heavy than, lets say Norton's anthology. And because it is a 'pocket anthology' it cuts out the weaker poems making this a strong group of poems.	2004-02-27
Looks like a good diet	The South Beach Diet looks like it might be a good diet. It doesn't ask you to starve yourself nor are you denied certain foods (and the ones we enjoy the most) for the rest of your life. It doesn't require additional excercise (though it helps). It changes your blood chemistry and since it is a cardiologist that developed the diet, it is heart healthy. Also, it does allow some carbs and unlike Atkins requires that you eat until full, but still in moderation. There are a lists of good foods and foods to avoid as well as meal plans and recipes for all three stages of the diet (stage one lasts only a couple of weeks; stage two until you reach your ideal weight; stage three after you reach your ideal weight). It looks good, but since I've just read the book, it is still to early to tell.	2004-02-26
i finally read it	After all this time I've finally started to read the Harry Potter series. I had planned on avoiding it still, but I figure anyone who makes a study of popular culture, the Potter series is a must. It surprised me by turning out to be quite good. I wouldn't have expected it to create the mania it did, but still I found it to be a well-written and entertaining book. Not at all offensive. And a little simplistic at times.	2004-02-26
another winner from addonizio	I very excitedly waited for Addonizio's latest collection of poetry to come out, and even though I didn't have the money, I bought it within a couple of weeks of its publication. And I read slowly so that I could savor this collection. Addonizio is a phenomenal poet--probably the best of her generation--a mix of Anne Sexton and Edna St. Vincent Millay. I will admit that this is the weakest of her collections (though it would be hard to top Tell Me and The Philosopher's Club). Even so, it is great work, especially \\"First Kiss\\" and \\"Stolen Moments\\" which are classic Addonizio. Also of note are \\"Dear Reader\\" and \\"Fever Blues\\" and \\"California Street\\" which is definitely one of the best in the book. She also writes a well done sonnenizio (it's explained in the book) and a very workable paradelle. I can never say enough good about the work of Kim Addonizio, and her latest collection is no exception.	2004-02-26
Book 2	The second book in the Potter series is as good as the first book. Nothing amazingly spectacular, but a good read for people of all ages. It is a little simple at times, but on the whole, almost believable, though you'd think that the wizards in training would have a little more respect for their elders. But self-sufficiency is important. Let me put it this way, I wouldn't not recommend this book.	2004-02-26
great bio	Middlebrook wrote a pretty good biography of one of our more important poets, though I'll say that Sexton is an example of the artist being more interesting than the art. What makes this biography so exceptional is the access Middlebrook had--she had access to Sexton's psychiatric tapes. Middlebrook can really give a full account of Sexton's life and psyche. And believe me, that woman was really screwed up.	2004-02-25
excellent biography	Meyers has an excellent biography of Fitzgerald, based heavily on letters, journals, and other writings. Meyers also gets pretty into an analysis of each of Fitzgerald's books and some of his better short stories. I will say that the first couple of chapters are slow going, but it gets better when Fitzgerald meets Zelda. And Meyers gives a pretty good portrait of her as well. This is really a first rate biography.	2004-02-19
an interesting selection	Giroux has selected an interesting group of work for Lowell's Collected Prose. There is writing on Frost, Bishop, Eliot, Berryman, among others. You get pieces of Lowell's 'autobiography' as well as some of his earliest writing (one of which was published in his school's paper). There are also two interviews and Lowell's letters to Presidents Roosevelt and Johnson. There is some really good stuff here, though I'll admit, unlike his classmate Jarrell, Lowell isn't always that great. Still, it wasn't a bad book.	2004-02-16
this is pretty awful	most collections of poetry i find hard to be anything but ambivalent about, so i get real excited when i come across a great collection. i can even get excited about coming across a collection as bad as this one. at least it makes me feel something. the topics are banal or preachy. bottum has only the most basic grasp of form and what he does know is used ineffectively.	2004-02-16
this is all you need	I know that the new Collected Poems has recently arrived, and it is a massive tome. But you don't really need it. Most of what Lowell wrote after &quot;For the Union Dead&quot; isn't that great. And in the Selected you get a great selection from what is effectively Lowell's first book, Lord Weary's Castle--which is a pretty strong book. There is also a generous selection from Life Studies and For the Union Dead (though I've bought the book that contains both complete collections). Lowell was a pretty important poet, but really, the Collected just goes overboard. This is all you really need.	2004-02-16
a good starting off point	This biography is a well-written, entertaining biography. It seems to be a good place to start your study of Plath. Trouble with the Hughes caused there to be much less quotes from Plath herself than we would have liked to have seen. And it seems a bit short to cover one of our most important poets in just under 250 pages. But still, it is a good book and a good place to begin.	2004-02-16
and yet another anthology	On my ever growing shelf of poetry anthologies, I have added Poulins' Contemporary American Poetry. It is a fair selection of poems. Of course it is a matter of opinion as to who is missing and who should be in there (no Hecht or Thom Gunn, which is a big loss). There are excellent selections of poems for Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Bly, Gwendolyn Brooks, Rita Dove, Alan Dugan, Robert Hayden, Maxine Kumin, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and W.D Snodgrass. There are other excellent poets in here (such as Marilyn Nelson and Andrew Hudgins), but the selection of poems isn't the best work they have. For content you might want to look elsewhere, there are important poems and poets that are missing here.<br />What I do like about this anthology is the way it is put together. Before each poet's selection there is a full page picture of the poet--so you can see what they looked like. It's not important, but it is nice to see. And they bios at the end are great. They cover the poet's life and a little critical work about the poems themselves. The Notes on the Poets is what truly makes this anthology worthwhile.	2004-02-08
This is a great book	In Country is a great coming of age novel as well as an anti-war story. Sam, our lead character, has to come to terms with the Vietnam War killing her father, and what he had to do over ther, and seriously messing up her uncle and several other veterans. It is a great story along the lines of The Bell Jar or any other coming of age story. It is good. I highly recommend it. This is Mason at her best.	2004-02-08
another great first book	It is always a joy to me when I come across a great poet's first book. Finding a good collection of contemporary poetry can be difficult, and finding one that is the poet's first book gets downright hard. Luckily I found Jennifer Reeser's first book. This book has it all: beautiful language, a wide range of subjects, and technical prowess. She writes lyrics, dramatic monologues, and narratives. You'll find sonnets and the lesser known sapphics as well as other forms. I have no doubt that Reeser will one day take her place with those great women poets of the past and present.	2004-01-31
amazing	One would never expect to find something in the Bible that is so sensual, so erotic. Poetry yes, eroticism no. But it  is there in the Song of Songs. Solomon's poem (and you couldn't call this book anything other than a poem) is beautifully written. This is one of my favorite books in the Bible.<br />What I like about this edition is that one, it is pocket sized. Two, it contains only the Song of Solomon, so that you can read it on its own, separated completely from the rest of the Bible. And three, A.S. Byatt has a great introduction (longer than the poem itself) to the Song of Solomon. Very informative and good reading. It is a shame that this is only readily available in the UK.	2004-01-31
weak neruda	Now I like Neruda. I think he is an important poet, and I fully expected to love this collection. But as I read it I found that I didn't really like any of the poems. There were a few that were almost passable, but only a couple. I don't know if it was Merwin's translation, Neruda's writing, or just me not connecting with the poetry. I say read Neruda, just not this collection.	2004-01-30
weaker than i expected	I really expected a lot out of this collection, but I found it to be rather weak as a whole. In fact, many of the poems were a stretch as to if I'd even call them love poems. &quot;Because I Don't Know&quot; stands out as both a great poem and a great love poem. But one of the other of the best poems &quot;Strawberrying&quot; is a stretch, I think, to call it a love poem, though there is some sensual imagery in it. I just thought that this collection would be better than what it is.	2004-01-29
It's really quite good	Grotz's first collection is a rather impressive one. Yes it has its faults. It does sag in the middle, but the first section is wonderful and the final section is quite good. But the books also has its positive points. Grotz covers a wide range of styles and subjects in her poems. And though none stick out as a truly phenomenal poem, there are many good poems in the book. I look forward to seeing more of her work as she matures.	2004-01-28
gets a bit weighty	Donald Hall's collection The Painted Bed sort of does more of the same, lamenting the loss of his wife. A poem or two is one thing, but whole book? There are some good poems in this book, both of the long poems are pretty good (&quot;Kill the Day&quot; &amp; &quot;Daylillies on the Hill&quot;). Hall's painted bed is just too much, though I also thought &quot;Impossible Lovers&quot; was pretty good.	2004-01-26
couldn't hold me	Matt Braun is a pretty fair western writer. Some of his books are blah, but he also has some really great stories to tell. I started to read Hickok &amp; Cody, and while I'm sure it isn't badly written, Braun just couldn't hold my interest. I only went through chapter 2. I had to stop because there are too many phenomenal books out there to spend time reading something that doesn't just grab me.	2004-01-26
young adult novel	I knew this was a young adult novel when I picked it up, but it had an interesting premise. The novel works out more or less, though its ending seems a bit forced and contrived. I found myself rooting for one set of people when Klause takes us in reverse, and rather abruptly. It's really the ending that I've trouble with.	2004-01-26
I'm not sure what to make of this book	I'm not quite sure just what to make of Go Ask Alice. It claims to be a 'real diary' but there are parts of it that make me wonder. I could see this written, completely ficticiously, as an anti-drug book. Still, real or not, it does try to examine the drug issue and does an ok work of it. I'd say for a better choice pick up William Burroughs' Junky.	2004-01-26
powerful memoir	I'm not a big fan of bike racing, so I wasn't sure how much I'd like to read a biographer about a bike racer. And written by him--just because he is a good athlete doesn't necessarily make him a good writer (but he has Sally Jenkins there to help with that). But this memoir wasn't just about bike racing. It was about cancer and surviving it. In fact, more about cancer than racing. There was something spiritual about Armstrong's experience, both on the bike and with cancer. Even if you aren't a big fan of the sport, this is still a good memoir to read.	2004-01-25
his best since I, Vampire	I think that Vampire's Violin is Romkey's best book since I, Vampire (little could top it). Romkey's vampire world was starting to get a little stale and then he writes this novel. It's a haunting, beautiful tale. Romkey's use of language is as beautiful as his first half of I, Vampire. It's a story of vampires, music, love, and a violin. And a divine book.	2004-01-25
a novel of conformity	Sinclair Lewis is best known for his novel Main Street. But Babbitt is a fine novel. H.G. Wells said of it: &quot;I wish I could have written Babbitt.&quot; It's a novel about George F. Babbitt and the city he lives in, Zenith. Some of the greatest lines in the book are descriptions of Zenith, not the least of which is the opening lines. Lewis creates in Babbitt the total conformist and we follow him through his conformity and into thinking on his own. Babbitt is simply a man who wants to be liked by everyone. Babbitt gives expression to the glibness and irresponsibility of the professional social climber. Lewis gives us one of our modern classics.	2004-01-25
powerfully moving	A Separate Peace is a great story set at a boarding school during WWII. Knowles writes beautifully this story about friendship, tragedy, innocence, and war. Read it slowly so you can savor Knowles's words. You can get something from every page of this novel.	2004-01-23
classic children's book	Sound won a Newberry. And because it is a pretty good book. It's a coming of age story for a young black male. It's about family, death, love, and god. Sounder is at the core--not physically there, but in the boy's mind (and I don't know that Armstrong ever named any of the characters except the dog). He isn't there except at the beginning and the end. But hey, this is a great book. Get it for your kids and enjoy.	2003-12-22
it's no myth that this book is great	This 2-in-1 is volumes three and four in Asprin's hit Myth series. Both are great stories and great books. Myth Directions deals with the game the gang plays in order to win the Trophy (...Tanda...). And Hit or Myth is truly hilarious as Skeeve has to pretend to be the king and avoid marriage. These are great books.	2003-12-20
another fine myth	Book five has Skeeve wandering around in searching for Aahz in a dimension where magic doesn't work and humans are the monsters. It's hilarious--a world of vampires and werewolves. <BR>Little Myth Marker brings in Markie, who adds a new level of hilarity to the gang. And Skeeve goes into his high stakes Dragon Poker. Marvelous.	2003-12-20
no myth-stake, skeeve and co. are back	This is the final volume (as I understand it anyway) to Robert Asprin's Myth series. It's sad to see all our old friends--Skeeve, Aahz, Tanda, Guido, Bunny, etc--but the book does feel like it is time. It doesn't feel like Asprin has any more to add to the series, and he wraps it all up rather nicely. This is also one of those revolving viewpoint novels, though Skeeve's pov is included. It's a nice end to a great series.	2003-12-20
two great myth books in one	Asprin's Myth series combines traditional fantasy with humor and satire. He gives us multiple characters that are believable and you grow to love very quickly. Many authors couldn't handle juggling this many primary characters (not to mention the whole slew of secondary characters) and this complicated of a series. It's myth-fastic.	2003-12-20
the dog IS a toy	The title sums this all up: The Dog is Not a Toy (House Rule #4). It perfectly describes the relationship of Bucky and Satchel, and Rob. The playfulness--the edgy playfulness and biting wit. This is pretty much the only strip worth reading now that The Far Side and Calvin &amp; Hobbes are retired.	2003-12-20
one of oprah's few hits	Oprah's book club has done a lot for the state of contemporary literature, though most of her picks aren't that great. But every now and then she'll pick a good book. Where the Heart Is is one of those good books. It's a sweet story, without becoming saccharine. It's got a great hook--a pregnant woman lives and gives birth in a small town Wal-Mart. Who wouldn't read that? Letts gives you great characters that you can't help but care for in spite of yourself. Letts does flirt with the boundaries of cliche and emotionalism at times, but she never quite crosses that boundary--too badly at least. It's a good book.	2003-12-19
400 of the finest pieces of art	I've just added The Portable Picasso to my list of greatest art books. First of all, Picasso is one of the best artists that lived, only Van Gogh is better and Matisse comes close. This inexpensive volume collects 400 of this master's art in a portable, easy to look at volume. This is just a wonderful book.	2003-12-19
classic	Silverstein's The Giving Tree is one of those timeless classics that you read and loved as a kid, and have found that you still love to read it thirty years later. It's a simple story of unconditional love and friendship. Truly it is about family. And the simple, elegant line drawings are perfect for this story. Every child--every adult should own a copy of this book.	2003-12-19
pretty solid intro	This book is a pretty solid introduction to music history. It's not too detailed, the author keeps it pretty simple. He does try a little too hard to be funny, especially those footnotes. There are nice illustrations as well.	2003-12-19
an interesting little book	This is an interesting little book. I'll admit it is only for the fans, and the hardcore fans at that (those like me, who might have a little obssession for Jewel). The book isn't even written by her. What it is is various remarks made by those who know Jewel. Nothing great, but it has a great cover photo.	2003-12-19
weakest in the series	Myth-ion Improbable is the weakest of the Myth books. That's not saying much though, since the series as a whole is such a great collection of books. This is the only one that I give four stars to. I think it is because it had been so long since Asprin had written a Myth book, and he had to refind his rhythm. And this book interrupts the sequence (it is book 11, but it takes place between 3 &amp; 4). Asprin seems to have to stretch a little with this episode, which he hasn't had to do in any of the others. But don't let me give you the impression that this is a substandard book, because it isn't. It's a great book too. And I'm glad he wrote it.	2003-12-19
pretty solid anthology	Webb's definition of what 'Stand Up Poetry' is contains all that I love in poetry--including humor, sensuality, sexuality, and more. In fact, Webb's introduction is a great one. I'd recommend you read it, if nothing else. Now, I wouldn't say that all the poems are great, or that even all of them live up to Webb's criteria, but you get a lot of good work in here. You'll find Kim Addonizio (two wonderful poems by her), Charles Bukowski, Lucille Clifton, Wanda Coleman, Billy Collins (always a pleasure to read), Stephen Dunn, Russell Edson, Paul Hoover, Maxine Chernoff, Dorianne Laux, Bob Hicok, Thomas Lux, Pattiann Rogers, James Tate, David Trinidad, Fred Voss, and B.H. Fairchild's phenomenal poem \\"Body and Soul.\\"<BR>as well as good work from Kurt Brown, Philip Dacey, Barbara Hamby, Deborah Harding, Tony Hoagland, Suzanne Lummis, and Dan Nielsen. <BR>Trust me, this is an anthology you want to read.	2003-12-19
an amazing story	Krakauer tells the fascinating story of a young man, from a well-off family, who hitchhiked alone into the Alaskan wilderness and turned up dead. It is a fascinating story, and one that Krakauer tells well. His prose is informative and flows well. He has a good sense of story. This is an amazing book--and I recommend you pick it up and read it.	2003-12-19
not as strong as i remember it	Like many people, I read this book first when I was a small child. And it has been maybe 20 years since I've seen it. I picked it up to reread it (doesn't take long) and I found that it wasn't as strong of a book as I remember it to be. I'm not talking about the simple language, after all, it is written for a child. Rather, the characters are one dimensional. And the children seem far to quick to accept Sarah as their new mother.<br />But, it is a children's book, and doesn't have to stand up to the close scrutiny one gives an adult's book. It is a touching story about love and the creation of a family. It helps to teach accpetance, even love of a stepparent. I do recommend this for the kids.	2003-12-19
my first year with this series	This year I decided I'd like to pick up the New Stories from the South and check it out this year. Not bad. There were a handful of really good stories and a handful of really bad, and quite a few in the middle. It's not a bad addition to reading the Best American Short Stories (especially since both Pushcart and the O. Henry Awards are weakening). I won't say this is the best selection I've come across, but it's pretty good. I look forward to next year's edition.	2003-12-19
a myth is born	I first ran across Asprin's Myth books many years ago at the public library, and they've stuck in my head ever since. You can imagine my surprise when I ran across the complete set in paberback at the local bookstore. Asprin was one of the pioneers in this genre of humor/fantasy books. He has great characters, well rounded and believable. He spoofs whatever he can in the genre. And he does it well. If you haven't read these books, then you need to get started. And since this is book one and two, this is the place to start.	2003-12-19
the last action hero (i hope)	This is a cute book that covers those 'skills' that are 'essential' to being a real life action hero. This was cute the first time it was done. But now you just get the feeling that they've run out of ideas. I hope this'll be the end of this series, or at least it'll be the last one I buy.	2003-12-19
pretty solid	This year's Best American Mystery Stories is a pretty good collection of stories. In fact, most of the stories are pretty good--we've all the usual suspects in this volume. I'll say the best two stories in the collection are by two Christophers, Chambers and Cook. This is a good collection to read.	2003-12-19
for the buff only	This really isn't that interesting of a book. It's a collection of Civil War recipes--but nothing you'd want to eat. Really, this is only for the Civil War buff.	2003-12-19
disapointing	For the past couple of years I've been seeing Bob Hicok's work in various journals and anthologies. I always found the poems interesting and pretty good, if not stellar. And I've seen some good reviews for Animal Soul, so I was rather excited when I finally picked up this book. And I found it a bit disapointing. I'll admit, these weren't the most awful poems I've read, but Hicok's rambling all over the place in a single poem weakened the good work. And I found that his line breaks generally seemed arbitrary and disrupting to the flow of the poem. But the poems I've read of Hicok's that I like should be in his next book, so I'll keep my eye open for it.	2003-12-18
another mediocre volume	What we have here is another mediocre volume in what should be a great series. And this year's looked promising, but you'll find very few poems worth noting inside.	2003-12-18
solid collection	There's little I can add to the reviews that the other reviewers haven't already said, and said well. I'll just chime in with my opinion: it's a solid collection of essays and I'd recommend it.	2003-12-18
the best  year yet	This year's edition of The Best American Essays is the best one I've read so far. Almost every essay is worth reading (there are a few that weren't very good), and half of the essays are phenomenal essays. Pick any essay in this collection (go with Spufford's &quot;The Habit&quot;) and you can't go wrong. This is what all the various best of volumes should be like. Excellent.	2003-12-18
good	I don't know what else to say about Billy Collins that I haven't said elsewhere. He's a remarkable poet, who does his thing and does it well. Picnic, Lightning is a pretty solid collection of poems, though if you have Collins's selected poems there's no need to pick this one up. Those that weren't included in the selected aren't very good, with the exception of &quot;I Go Back to the House For a Book,&quot; which I think is a marvelous poem and should have been included in the selected poems.	2003-12-18
phenomenal	Since Gary Larson retired The Far Side and Bill Watterson retired Calvin &amp; Hobbes, and since Jim Davis has farmed out Garfield (which has lost its edge as a result), I've had a hard time finding a strip worth reading. Then I came across Get Fuzzy. This strip is hilarious. In Bucky (the cat) you've all the edge and humor that was in Calvin &amp; Hobbes and the old Garfield. Satchel (the dog) is a talking Odie, though a bit smarter. And they interplay with their strait man, Rob. It adds up to the best strip I've seen in years.	2003-12-18
a new low	Prize Stories now has a new editor. I never thought I'd miss the old editors, but I do. This year's collection has reached a new low. There are almost no stories within this volume worth reading. Anthony Doerr's &quot;The Shell Collector&quot; is a phenomenal story. The other stories worth reading are by: Robyn Joy Leff, Marjorie Kemper, Tom Johnston, Tim O'Brien, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Other than that, I'd just skip this edition all together.	2003-12-18
you must experience it...	This is a great strip. You have the loveable Satchel, the edgy Bucky--who is hilarious and the heart of the strip--, and the straight man, Rob. Bless him for all he has to put up with. This is a good collection of a great strip. With the loss of The Far Side and Calvin &amp; Hobbes, this is all that is left--worth reading anyway.	2003-12-16
it's only logical to buy this book	I can keep this short and sweet. Get Fuzzy is the best strip currently being produced. This is a great collection of the strip. Buy this book.	2003-12-16
a long exhibition	I've said before how much I love Gary Larson's work. You won't find much in here that you won't find in the galleries. What does make this book worthwhile is the Wiener Dog Art Gallery in the center. You won't find it in the galleries (at least not like this). Each pieces is in color and a full page, with a hilarious caption beside it. The gallery alone makes this book worth the price.	2003-12-16
wow	This book really surprised me. I never expected Nimoy to be such a great photographer. We know him as Spock, and we've seen his acting. We know his poetry has pretty much been ranked as one of the worst ever, but Nimoy really found his voice with the camera. This book is sensual, artistic, and never crude. It's beautiful work, and I look forward to seeing more of his work.	2003-12-16
a tearful farewell	This book is the last six months of Far Side cartoons. Plus 13 new cartoons. They are phenomenal. And now, a moment of silence for The Far Side...	2003-12-16
great for the X-fans	There isn't a whole lot to say about this book. It's an 'encyclopedia' of the X-Men. It covers them and their history pretty well and also delves into some of the alternate X-Men. If you are an X-Fan, I'd definitely get this book, otherwise, go to something else.	2003-12-16
unnatural	Why should you pick up Unnatural Selections when you have all the Galleries. Because in the center of this book you'll find, full-page in full color on glossy pages. It's the evolution of life as only Gary Larson can tell it.	2003-12-16
a nice new take on a classic	What Maguire tries to do here is give us a different perspective on L. Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz. Maguire tells the story from the Wicked Witch's point of view. Here we see a more sympathetic witch, one who is not a bad person, but has had her life take same bad turns. In this Dorothy and her crew are a bit more...well, wrong. It's an interesting idea that Maguire has turned into a good story.	2003-12-16
seems to get worse every year	I don't know what is going on with the Pushcart series. It used to be such a valuable volume to read, but lately it gets weaker with every passing year. I'm not going to even talk about the poetry contained within. None of it is worth mentioning. And in their prose there are only four pieces that are really good. Sit down with this volume at your book store or library and just read them, don't purchase this book.<br />Mark Ray Lewis &quot;Scorduatura&quot; (fiction)<BR>Cornelia Nixon &quot;Lunch at teh Blacksmith&quot; (fiction)<BR>Jeffrey A. Lockwood &quot;To Be Honest&quot; (memoir)<BR>Bradford Morrow &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (fiction--though it has a weak ending)	2003-12-16
I love this little sponge	What can I say, I love SpongeBob. He's funny, and works on two levels, one for the kids and another for the adults. I will say that this book is only for the collector. It's moronic and rather silly, even for SpongeBob--so if you collect SpongeBob stuff, it'll look good next to your stuffed Patrick, but otherwise, skip it and pick up one of the dvds.	2003-12-15
phenomenal	This is a phenomeal book--it's a classic dark comedy. Humor runs through this novel, even at its darkest moments--and there are a few laugh out loud moments. The book has a deeply philosophical bent to it. The characters are likeable, even the most annoying of the bunch, and the storyline is plausible, even if it stretches here and there. I do think the ending is a littl weak, but overall you are dealing with a great story: humor, philosophy, anthropology, and the apocalypse. You just can't go wrong.	2003-12-15
another mixed bag	I've been reading this series for a few years now, and I've found as a whole, it's a pretty mixed bag. Sure, you get some great stories, but you get some really bad stories, and many that are just middle of the road. Here's this year's breakdown:<br />I'm going to say that this year's introduction, written by guest editor Walter Mosley, was especially well-written--It's a great intro to an anthology such as this. Other highlights were Sharon Pomerantz's &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;, ZZ Packer's &quot;Every Tongue Shall Confess&quot; (which has appeared in a few other of these 'best of' anthologies), Nicole Krauss's &quot;Future Emergencies&quot;, Ryan Harty's &quot;WHy the Sky Turns Red When the Sun Goes Down&quot;, and, what is the best story in the collection, Anthony Doerr's &quot;The Shell Collector.&quot; <br />This year's stories that don't belong in any best of anthology were written by: Marilene Phipps, Dean Paschal, Louise Erdrich, Edwidge Danticat, Kevin Brockmeier, and Dorothy Allison.<br />Everybody else's work just isn't worth mentioning, either as great work or as poor work--it's that middle of the road work i mentioned.	2003-12-15
a step down	This is the second year of the Best American's newest series, The Best American Nonrequired Reading. Last year's volume was an interesting mix of work. This year is another interesting mix of work, though I will say that it is not nearly as good as last year's volume. <br />Let's focus on the best pieces, which includes Zadie Smith's introduction (skip the weak forward by Eggers). There is also a great article by Mark Bowden (who brought us Black Hawk Down), David Drury, Aamanda Holzer (great way to tell a story, by listing songs), Chuck Klosterman, Daniel Voll, and David Sedaris, who is great as he always is. I'd skip the pieces by Sherman Alexie, Lynda Barry, Michael Buckley, Dylan Landis, Andrea Lee, Nasdijj, and John Verbos--they're pretty weak. Still, the stronger pieces do make up for the weaker ones. But I do hope Eggers is careful, or next year he'll run the risk of turning this into another mediocre Pushcart-type volume.	2003-12-15
surprisingly good	I imagine I picked this book up the same reason everyone else did. The rumors and ideas we had of Traci Lords, and we wanted to read about it. But as it turns out Traci isn't the 'porn queen,' and little of that work can be found. Traci found her voice with this memoir. You really feel the hurt and despair the young Traci felt. We travel with her through the rough times, the porn time (which, thankfully, she didn't go into graphic detail--through it all Traci was tactful), and finally the good times, when her life turned--when she changed her life. I didn't expect this book to be all that well written and maybe not even intersting. But I was wrong. Traci wrote an engaging and powerful book. Read it. I think it will surprise you too.	2003-12-15
the best of a great American poet	E A Robinson has long been respected in American poetry--by poets such as Frost and Yvor Winters. It's no wonder why, Robinson has a command over form and language we don't often get to see. Just look at poems as diverse as &quot;The Valley of the Shadow,&quot; &quot;Eros Turannos,&quot; &quot;The Mill,&quot; and &quot;Aunt Imogen.&quot; Or you could look at his three most famous poems, the poems that we know Robinson for: &quot;Richard Cory,&quot; &quot;Reuben Bright,&quot; and &quot;Miniver Cheevy.&quot; I don't need to tell you why you need to read Robinson, that should be evident already. Mezey's edition is a great one because it is an inexpensive edition that contains the best poems by Robinson--and notes to many of them. There are also three appendices. One contains various quotes from Robinson himself as well as a brief selection of comments by other poets and critics on Robinson. And as a special treat there is the introduction Robert Frost wrote for King Jasper. And Mezey's introduction is well-written and informative.	2003-12-15
another childhood classic	Sendak's _Where the Wild Things Are_ is another of those classic books from my childhood--this one even won a Caldecott. It's a simple story with some good artwork--perfect for kids. It even contains the underlying theme of home. I loved it as a child, and I'd recommend it for your kids.	2003-12-15
a reintroduction to a great poet	Winters is best known as a critic and as a teacher--he's taught some great poets, and they in turn have taught some great poets... We have a lot to thank Yvor Winters for. But people sometimes forget that Winters was a poet as well. Some of my favorite poems are: &quot;Jose's Country,&quot; &quot;October,&quot; &quot;Full Moon,&quot; &quot;Sleep,&quot; &quot;The Passing Night,&quot; &quot;The Fable,&quot; &quot;The Fall of Leaves,&quot; &quot;Moonlight Alert,&quot; &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,&quot; and &quot;The Journey.&quot;<br />Thom Gunn edited this addition to the great new series Library of America is putting out, 'American Poets Project.&quot; Gunn himself is a great poet, and brings a good sensibility to his selection of Winters' poetry. You get some phenomenal poems in this collection. Gunn also includes the one short story Winters wrote. And surprisingly, it is a pretty good story. This is a great edition of a poet I'm afraid that we have almost forgotten. We have to thank Library of America for creating this new series, and Thom Gunn for his selection of Winters poetry.	2003-12-15
It's really quite goodq	I picked this book up, probably like most people, because of the subtitle and cover of the book. It got me interested in it. I read the synopsis and decided to get this book. And let me tell you, it was not a mistake. This is a wonderful book. It's well-written, highly entertaining, and helps you to understand the plight of the transgendered. Boylan is a remarkable author. I have no trouble highly recommending this book.	2003-12-15
one of the best in american poetry	Elizabeth Bishop is one of the greatest American poets we've ever had--only Frost and perhaps maybe Whitman are more important. She is certainly Emily Dickinson's equal, and in my opinion, a finer poet. When discussing American poetry, Bishop can't be ignored. Her imagery, her use of form, her command over the language is rarely matched, and this collection contains all her work. There's her first book, _North &amp; South_, which is one of the finest volumes of poetry produced. You'll find poems like &quot;The Map,&quot; &quot;The Man-Moth,&quot; &quot;The Weed,&quot; &quot;The Imaginary Iceberg,&quot; &quot;Seascape,&quot; and the masterful poem, &quot;The Fish.&quot; _A Cold Spring_ follows, containing &quot;At the Fishhouse&quot; and &quot;Letter to N.Y.&quot; &quot;The Armadillo&quot; (Bishop's poem to Robert Lowell), &quot;Filling Station,&quot; &quot;Visits to St. Elizabeths&quot; and &quot;Sestina&quot; (one of the few poems in this form that actually works) follows in _Questions of Travel_.  Then there is a selection of uncollected work (1969) before we hit _Geography III_ which contains two of her best poems, &quot;Cruso in England&quot; and &quot;One Art&quot;--which is in my opinion her best poem. The collection rounds out with some more uncollected poems, juvenalia, and some fine translations. Overall, you have an important book by one of our most important poets.	2003-12-14
400 masterworks of art	If you ask who the greatest artists that lived are, you are going to hear Leonardo, Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Picasso, and of course, Matisse. Whether he was painting, drawing, or making a collage, Matisse's work will strike you--move you. And this edition is a nice, inexpensive collection of one of the master's works. There's an informative, well-written introduction and then there are 400 pieces of his art. The reproductions of Matisse's works are pretty good (though some span two pages, which always irritates me since you miss so much in the fold) and this isn't some giant tomb. It's a smallish paperback book you can carry with you on the bus or train or anywhere you wish to look at Matisse's work--even at a Picasso exhibition...	2003-12-12
middling	I'm gonna have to go with middle of the road with Lerner's work. His A.R.T.H.U.R. work is interesting (experimental work) work, but not that great, nor will it be 'important' in the future. The poems selected from his second book, The Directions of Memory, are the strongest here, especially &quot;A Birthday Car to my Best Friend.&quot; Also of note is one of his earlier poems, &quot;Through Literature to Life.&quot;	2003-12-12
one of our greatest 'anti war' novels	Hemingway has proved himself as a short story writer--his are some of the best ever written. He won the Nobel for The Old Man and the Sea. And he showed us his skill at creative nonfiction with A Moveable Feast. But I hadn't yet read a full-length novel written by what is one of the quintissential American authors. I chose to start with A Farewell to Arms. And this is a wonderful book. It's a beautiful, though tragic, love story set during WWI--on the front lines. We get to watch this love unfold. And Hemingway gives us what has been called the definitive antiwar novel without ever preaching. I did find a little fault with only one thing. Hemingway's language is just a little simplistic at times. But even still, it is a beautiful story.	2003-12-12
close to god	This is one my must have books. It is a masterpiece of spirituality. I'll be the first to admit, its literary quality isn't much. It is rather simplistically written, but the message behind it is so powerful that you have to read it. It will take you to enlightenment.	2003-12-12
pretty good	It's actually pretty good (I had read another collection of Barker comics that wasn't so good, so I had my doubts). A couple of the stories seem to make little or no sense, but as a whole, they are well written stories. Most of the art is pretty good too. All in all, the collection is, well, pretty good-- and Gaiman is here too.	2003-12-06
it's a pretty good intro	Greenberg and Jordan's book is a pretty good introduction to the work of one of our modern masters, Chuck Close. Chuck Close is a phenomenal painter, both before the onset of his disease and even more so after. You won't find many books on him, or many that contain his work. Until something a bit more 'adult' or comprehensive comes out, this is a good selection. It discusses his life and work. There is also a brief chapter on what is a portrait. They finish it off with a list of museums that have some of Chuck Close's work. It's a nice intro to a great artist.	2003-12-01
brilliant	Gary Larson is by far the most genius, the most innovative cartoonest ever to hit the world. This gallery has a forward by Robin Williams and tons of Larson's best work. You can't not love his sense of humor (and definitely check out the Prehistory of the Far Side).	2003-12-01
a bit over the top	Coulter's work is a bit over the top. She has some pretty good ideas (though not all), but then she just keeps speaking. Treason loses all credibility because Coulter won't stick to her philosophy or the facts (though I'm not sure of the accuracy of all her facts), but she has to go into name calling--let me tell you, not a page goes by that she doesn't call someone or some group some name. Like I said, there are some good ideas contained within the book, but you have to wade past so much dreck to get to them. Pass this one by.	2003-12-01
pretty fair, for the most part	Al Franken's book is for the most part pretty fair and evenhanded. He tries to stick to the facts, and unlike Coulter, he doesn't spend that much time name calling (though it does happen here and there). He generally backs up what he says and doesn't get too rabid. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with everything he says, but he does try to keep it fair. Add that to Franken's wit and great writing style, and I'd say if you want to read a book discussing today's politics, then pick up Franken.	2003-12-01
mediocre at best	The book/movie has a great premise, a world where werewolves and vampires exist in a secret society. The werewolves tend to be the more dangerous to humans and the 'high-society' vampires (the werewolves are more like your trailer park trash and Hell's Angels types) hunt them. One of the vampires falls in love with a human turned werewolf (I can see Jessica Alba playing the vampire part, but they casted Kate Beckinsale; and Ewan MacGregor as our werewolf--they casted Scott Speedman, whoever that is)l There are some bright spots, but over all, it reads a bit amateurish. Now to be fair, this is a novelization of a movie (I haven't seen the movie) and they tend to be weak (except for Alan Dean Foster's novelizations of the Alien movies). What I wish is that this was an idea that a good writer had gotten, instead of Hollywood. This would make a great limited series, of say four or five books. But this is what we got, and I suppose it isn't bad for a novelization, but on the whole, it is weak. I'm not sure how the movie is, but I think you'd do better watchint it instead of reading it.	2003-10-16
what a sick man	Gary Larson created The Far Side comics and did so much for the world of comics. He broke taboos, he did disgusting things, he used intelligence with his wicked (and twisted) sense of humor. When you talk about the greatest cartoonists and strips you mention Garfield (old Garfield before Davis fielded out all the work), Calvin &amp; Hobbes (which fits perfectly with Larson), and The Far Side (I'd also include the relatively new strip, Get Fuzzy). This book collects Larson's work, new work, and work he never showed. You have to see it to believe it, and it is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.	2003-10-08
how could you not like it	After I don't know how many years, Marvel decided to take a big risk and reveal the origin of one of its most popular characters (if not their most popular character), Wolverine. It was a big risk because part of what makes Wolverine so popular is the mystery of who he is--his past. Jemas and crew did a great job here. It's a great story and the artwork is brilliant. Yes, it seems like just the first chapter in Logan's life, so I look forward to more like it. Jemas took one of their great characters and really filled it out. I include this book in my masterpieces of literature.	2003-10-08
one of the classics	Are You My Mother? is one of the classic children's books, like Pokey Little Puppy or Green Eggs and Ham. It is a wonderfully simple book full of love. It belongs on your required reading shelf.	2003-10-08
great first collection	Fennelly's book is the winner of the 2001 Kenyon Review Prize in Poetry. You have to read David Baker's (poetry editor of Kenyon Review) to really understand why. Then you have to read Fennelly's collection of poems, and you really understand why. It is a phenomenal collection of poems. There are countless poems in this collection that are great. This is a poet to watch.	2003-10-08
pretty good introduction	First, I'm not sure if this is the edition I have. This review is for Robert McPhillips THE NEW FORMALISM: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION, published by Volcanic Ash books. But I think the two match up somehow. So here goes.<br />Robert McPhillips has written a nice introduction to the group of poets that have the moniker, New Formalists. This is not an in-depth book on the poets or their movement, but it is a good place to start, and I'm curious to see where the criticism will go from here (this book should have been published years ago, but that's another story). <br />Chapters 1  and 2 covers the emergence of the New Formalism and just what it is--a good intro. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on Timothy Steele and Dana Gioia, respectively. And any study of the New Formalism has to include an in-depth study of them. 5 is Gjertrud Schnackenberg and the 'High Style.' This is one of those questionable chapters, I'm not sure how important she is to the 'movement.' Chapter 6 deal with narrative poetry, and McPhillips rightly discusses Dave Mason, Mary Jo Salter, Andrew Hudgins, and Robert McDowell. This is where I would have put Paul Lake, but he appears in the Steele chapter. 7 deals with verse satire and light verse, which is a very significant part of the New Formalism. Here McDowell discusses R.S. Gwynn, Tom Disch, and Charles Martin. The final chapter deals with the 'Revival of the Love Lyric.' I hadn't realized it had gone out of style, but still, this is an important chapter. McDowell briefly mentions poets that deserved more space, like Michael Donaghy, Kim Addonizio, Marilyn Nelson and Kate Light. A.E. Stallings is mention, but there definitely should have been more on her. And where was Tim Murphy? But like I said, and as the title says, this is just a 'critical introduction.' I look forward to the work that comes from this book.	2003-06-25
Carter's Nobel lecture	This is what it says it is, Jimmy Carter's Nobel Prize Lecture. It's brief. Carter doesn't really say much of anything in it, but he doesn't make a fool of himself. He's a great humanitarian, and this is his Nobel lecture. read it and enjoy	2003-06-25
This is awful	This collection of poetry is just awful. None of the poems have been published in a journal, and for good reason, they're not very good. It's poorly written with the intention to shock, but without the originality, skill, or edginess you find in cutting-edge poetry. Lennon goes over the top in his attempt to shock, and instead creates poor poetry. You want to read a poet who skillfully plays the edge between risqueness and over-the-top, but still staying on this side of it, then read Kim Addonizio or Sarah Cortez. Avoid this book. I  think Story Line, which normally publishes good work, published Lennon to try to give it an edge to its reputation. Let's just hope Story Line goes back to publishing quality work again.	2003-06-23
it's a phenomenal collection	This book was a National Book Award Finalist, and deservedly (This Time by Gerald Stern won that year, but I haven't read it yet, so I can't compare). <br />Fairchild was born in Houston, and grew up in West Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. His upbringing very much shows in his work. This is the poetry of the blue-collar working class. This is very much the poetry of the west and of Texas. Fairchild writes mostly longer narratives and dramatic monologues (most with longish lines). Some of the best poems of his are: \\"Beauty\\" the 10 page narrative of the working man, and this poem is phenomenal. It is one of the best contemporary poems written. And in fact, the only modern day narrative that is better is Dave Mason's \\"In the Country I Remember\\", though not by much. There is also one of the best baseball poems in recent years (or maybe the best baseball poem ever), \\"Body and Soul\\", a great narrative that runs a few pages and touches on the truth of the human soul of the working man. Also of great note is \\"Keats\\" (it'll surprise you) and \\"Cigarettes\\" a poem that finally gives us a reason to smoke. Or at least an understanding. The other poems in this collection are also great, those four are just the best.<br />There are two signs that clued me in that this was going to be a great book (other than the finalist of the Nat'l Book Award). The first were the blurbs. R.S. Gwynn, the modern day Pope, says \\"[Fairchild] measures a world inhabited by those for whom life has made its meaning plain by constant subtraction...both real and mataphorical, that figure so prominently in this collection.\\" Dana Gioia says of this collection: \\"Fairchild boldly plundesr the territories of prose to expand the possibilities of contemporary verse...These fluent poems are amnivorously intelligent. The reader never knows what will come next; but, as deeply psychological in their probings as a novel, they alwasy cohere.\\" Tim Steele, one of the greatest of the modern metricists, says \\"Fairchild bringssympathetic insight to the people...he has a gift for focusing on those moments when lives constrained by psychological or economic circumstances are touched by beauty and significance.\\" And Wyatt Prunty calls the poems \\"remarkably textured, genrous, haunting\\" . <br />And the other sign of this books importance is Anthony Hecth's introduction. No more needs to be said.	2003-06-22
Rant on brother	I rather liked this little book. I remember the essay in The Atlantic Monthly. I liked the essay then, and agreed with much of what Myers said. So it was nice to come across the essay in full like this. He takes on the pretentiousness of today's literary scene (and I've read a lot of the prize winners, so I know [what] wins). I haven't read much of the authors he used as his examples (Paul Auster, Don DeLillo, David Guterson, Cormac McCarthy, and Annie Proulx), but it doesn't matter. Myers doesn't get into plot or characters. You don't have to be familiar with the books (though it would help, I'll reread the chapters of this book as I read the works by those authors). He takes on the language they use. And nine times out of ten, Myers is right. This essay/book should get more attention. It's the equivalent of Dana Gioia's Can Poetry Matter?, only for the world of fiction.	2003-06-19
major drop in work	A Kiss in Space is a major drop in quality of work. Anyone who has read Salter's books Sunday Skaters or Unfinished Paintings knows Salter is a top notch poet, but A Kiss in Space is just not up to the standard I'm used to seeing from her. I hope her latest book is back up there.	2003-06-19
winner of the x.j. kennedy poetry prize	I'm not sure how this book won the X.J. Kennedy Poetry Prize. The collection isn't uneven, I found most of the poetry to be bad or dull. There are two great poems in there: her prose poem \\"The Wind\\" and \\"West of Tucson\\" and I'd also say \\"Irish Holiday\\" is worth noting. This book is nothing like her latest, Brave Disguises, which is a phenomenal book. But I can see in this collection how she is developing the voice and poetics she now has. Be forewarned, there is little narritive or even much linear structure within this volume. The Surface of Last Scattering seems to be saying something, the problem is, I'm not quite sure what. Check out those three poems I mentioned, then just skip to Brave Disguises--you won't be disappointed there.	2003-06-19
Feel This Review	The title, a pun on Abbie Hoffman's book, _Steal This Book_ (Garofalo did play Hoffman's wife in the movie, Steal this Movie). And it goes from there. I honestly expected to really like this book. I find Stiller to be hilarious, and Garofalo is funny as well as an excellent 'social conscience' and I might have grown up with a crush on her. The two make an excellent team, and I figured between their wit, intelligence, and what they have to say, that this would be a great book. Alas, that is not the case. It's in the humor section, and the book tries too hard to be funny (unlike Seinfeld's Seinlanguage, which is Jerry writing, and without effort, being interesting and funny). I was a little worried that Garofalo's politics would get in the way, but I figured Stiller would help keep her under control, keep it from being too preachy. But the book tried too hard to be funny (and you can never quite tell if they are being serious or 'funny'--knowing their beliefs and politics). It starts with a false table of contents, which I missed at first, and after I 'discovered' it, I thought it would annoy me, but it did not. Then there is the tounge in cheek Acknowledgements, followed by a Preface by Stiller and a Foreward by Garofalo. Then the book goes downhill. There is a warning about copies the book, based on the FBI warnings on video tapes. This is one of those cases where you aren't quite sure if this duo is being humorous, serious, or some combination of the two. Then you get rotating chapters written by one or the other. They just tried too hard to be funny, and it comes off forced. And you would have hoped that their appendices would have been a little serious, to get an idea of what books, movies, etc really did influence them. But no. I had worried about it being too preachy, but unfortunately, it wasn't serious enough. There is a fine line between parody and mediocre humor. It's tough to stay on the right side of the line.	2003-06-18
good collection of essays	Mason's collection of essays is a wide-ranging and overall pretty good collection of essays. The title essay is sort of a 'literary memoir', and while I expected it to be one of the better essays, it really isn't. But there are some excellent essays on Auden, Tennyson, Frost, Heaney, Louis Simpson, J.V. Cunningham, Anne Xexton, and Irish poetry. And then there are the essays meant to further the cause of the New Formalist movement. They almost sound like propoganda, but they are well written, enjoyable essays that make sense. And my favorite essay is \\"Other Lives: On Shorter Narrative Poems.\\" Mason is a phenomenal narrative poet, and anyone with an interest in narrative poetry should read this essay.	2003-06-01
atypical Twain	This isn't your typical Twain piece. It's still well crafted, like your typical Twain, and it makes its social commentary, like your typical Twain, but it does so without the biting satire that you find in most of Twain's work. It's a phenomenal piece of literature. It is his protest, his anti-war piece (written around 1905 in response to the Philippine-American War), and it is relevant still today--perhaps more so in today's world. The line drawings by John Groth add a sense of movement and urgency that works in counterpoint to Twain's words. This is an important piece of literature. And I'll leave with Twain's words on \\"The War Prayer\\":<br />'I have told the whole truth...and only dead men can tell the truth in this world. It can be published after I am dead.'	2003-06-01
one of the world's greatest	It's hard to fit a review of any of Kafka's work in such a short space, but especially a review of his short fiction (or rather parables, which is more what they are). He was a master of the short story, the likes of which we have seldom seen before or since. This volume contains most of his short stories, those that aren't included here are included elsewhere, where they are more fitting (such as \\"The Stoker\\" as the first chapter of Amerika). Kafka's short story \\"The Metamorphosis\\" is possibly the best short story ever written. It is certainly the most well known. But I'd like to draw your attention to a few other stories by him--examples of what makes Kafka great: \\"Before the Law\\", \\"In the Penal Colony\\", \\"A Country Doctor\\", \\"A Report to an Academy\\", \\"A Hunger Artist\\", \\"The Burrow\\", \\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\\", and \\"Jackals and Arabs.\\" Read this book.	2003-06-01
one of the finest volumes of poetry	Alicia Stallings' first collection of poetry is one of the most amazing books I've read. Not only is she the best poet of her generation, but one of the best of any generation. This book is amazing. Her education in Classics shows in her work. Section I takes different myths and creates the most amazing poems, like her dramatic monologues from Hades and Persephone. She takes also Apollo, eurydice and others. But there is more to this collection than just classical mythology. Just see \\"The Man Who Wouldn't Plant Willow Trees\\" to see Stallings at her very best. I will say, section II, titled A Bestiary, is rather weak. With the exception of the final poem, \\"A Lament for the Dead Pets of Our Childhood,\\" I found most of the poems weak. But despite that, Stallings technical skill, her beautiful use of language, and her all around skill makes this one of the best collections I've read.	2003-06-01
This is fantastic	Gray Jacobik's third collection, Brave Disguises, won selected by Marilyn Chin for the 2001 AWP Award Series in Poetry. And it is no surprise, this book is absolutely great. It's been added to my list of favorite collections of poetry. Jacobik writes with a clarity and beauty, a style that brings the poems straight into the reader. I don't think you can read this book and not love it. It's just that good.<br />Section one contains poems about art. You'll find \\"Pollock's Painting\\" here whose form mimics the energy and movement of Pollock's work. Also there is \\"The Clarinetist\\" which deserves its place among the great poems about music. <br />Section two contains poems about, as cliche as it sounds, about the human condition. These poems have a confessionalistic feel to them, but not the overtalky or poorly written style you find in most confessional poems (I'm not saying these are confessionalistic poems, that's just the best way I can describe them right now). In here you'll find \\"Breasts\\" which you have to read to believe, but I couldn't have put it better myself, \\"The Tapeworm\\" another that defies explanation, and \\"The Aftermath\\". Also there is \\"The Shabby Truth\\" which is the best poem of the book, and one I feel will be read and studied (or should be) for years to come. It's about a mother's relationship with her son, and the parallel their lives are taking. It's a warning. It's phenomenal. I'd say more, but I'd hate to spoil the poem for you. (Even if you don't buy this book, you should find this poem, first published in Diner, and read it). <br />The final section is the weakest of the book. It's more of those philosophical poems. I didn't really like it much. There were two poems of interest. One is an interesting poem about the homeless folks we see standing on the corners with their signs. The other comes from a line in Ginsberg. I can't repeat the title here, but it is a good poem (page 64).	2003-06-01
This is a phenomenal book	Missing Measures is a great book. Steele is a remarkable scholar. The book is well researched and written in a style that is easy to understand as well as being a very enjoyable book. It's of interest to anyone who enjoys poetry, formal or not. This is a great text in literary history/criticism. And it is important for those who want to understand the Modernist movement.	2003-06-01
good little book	The Dover Thrift edition of this book is a pretty good value. You get a handful of the great ballads Child gathered--like \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\", \\"The Unquiet Grave\\", \\"Lady Isabel ad the Elf-Knight\\", and \\"Bonny Barbara Allan\\"--without spending the fortune you would on the complete collection. It's a good introduction to the ballad, and these are some of the best written of the ancient British ballads.	2003-06-01
really good manual of prosody	I've read a few of these 'manuals on prosody' and I found Corn's to be one of the better ones. He writes in an easy to understand style that would help any beginner. He covers everything pretty well. I still prefer Fussell's Poetic Meter & Poetic Form and Tim Steele's All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing (though Corn's is written in an easier style, Fussell and Steele are more comprehensive), but I'd recommend this to those who want to learn how to write in meter and form.	2003-06-01
one of the better volumes in this series	In each volume of The Best American Poetry, there are usually a handful of really good or great poems, but on a whole, I find them to disappointing. It's generally not the best American poetry in any given year. Nor is 1995's volume the 'best' but it does have a higher number of good or great poems in it. Richard Howard (1995's guest editor) does a better job than most of the other guest editors I've read. You find poems by Margaret Atwood, Rafael Campo, Ginsberg, Marilyn Hacker, Anthony Hecht, Andrw Hudgins, Kizer, Kumin, Mary Jo Salter, and a great series of poems by Molly Peacock. There is also a wonderful poem by Sally Ball. I wish the series would get back up to this level of quality.	2003-06-01
marvelous	Nina Cassian's Selected Poems is a wonderful collection of her work, translated by some other great poets and translators (Richard Wilbur, Dana Gioia, William Jay Smith, and Carolyn Kizer). This collection isn't just about the art of poetry, it is about the art of translation. I wish there had been biographical notes on the translators, but other than that, it's a wonderful collection. I recommend it.	2003-05-28
i didn't much like it	I know William Jay Smith is a respected poet, but I found his poems to be lacking something. His style seems to be stuck in adult mode, but with children's-poem-style. I'm probably not making myself very clear here, but I didn't find myself hating the book. I just didn't like it, and keep seem to work myself up into saying much about the book. And that should say it all.	2003-05-28
The Body's Fire Fizzles	I read a great review of this book in Tar River Poetry. The excerpts of the poems were great--fresh & exciting. So I ordered this obscure little book. Great title. Nice design. Unfortunately, the excerpts from contained in the review is all that was good about the poetry. The poetry is stale. And these little textual experiments, where the poet 'plays' with the typewriter, don't work. They seem pointless. Like he was doing it just because he could, not because it meant anything. It's an interesting look, the poems curving all over the page (I suppose in a fluid, flame-like movement), but pointless. The book does become almost good with three of the middle poems. \\"Between Two Rooms\\" has two marvelous stanzas, but instead of ending it there, the poet goes on and writes a third stanza that pretty much ruins the whole poem. Then the title poem follows, so much potential that never quite gets there. And the third poem that is somewhat interesting is \\"The Interview\\". But none of these are that good, and they don't make it worth ordering this book. Pass on it.	2003-05-28
30 years of solid poems	Linda Pastan's book covers thirty years of her poetry, from 1968-1998, and it is a book worthy of having. Somone told me that Pastan was by no means a _great_ poet, but that she was a very good poet. There's no more accurate description of her work. She's not going to be another Frost or Plath or Dickinson or Bishop, but her work is enjoyable and quite well-written. There is a preponderance of religous and motherhood contained within, so be prepared. But that doesn't detract from the book. She handles her subjects well and her language well. I'll say it again, it is a good book and one I think you'll enjoy.	2003-05-21
a great guide	It comes as no surpise (since Dorianne Laux is a great poet and Addonzio is one of the best of her generation) that this is a great guide to writing poety (I love the subtitle: \\"A Guide to the Pleasures of Writing Poetry\\"-- note the pleasures). And it's good for any level of experience. It has a lot to teach the beginner, a help to the intermediate, and even the advanced student of poetry can get some ideas from this book. The first section of the book covers some subjects for writing, including family, death, and the erotic. Most of the book discussing the craft of poetry. The chapters deal with images, simile and metaphore, the line, voice, dreams and experiments, meter and rhyme, repetition and rhythm, the villanell, panotoum, and sestina, grammr, and revision. Then they have a section titled \\"The Writing Life\\" which deals with self-doubt, writer's block, getting published, and the internet. Most of the chapters end with writing exercises, to help give you ideas for poems and practice at writing. And at the end of the book they have their \\"Tweny-Minute Wriitng Exercises.\\" Addonizio and Laux chose, in general, great poems to illustrate whatever they are discussing. And the book even has several useful appenices: Books on Poetry and Writing; Anthologies for Further Reading; Finding Markets for Your Poems; and More Resources for Writers. It's a great guide and useful teaching tool, and told in a conversational, interesting voice. It's a purchase no poet will regret.	2003-05-21
cute	Smith's Collected Nonsense is a cute book, and I'm sure children love it, as well as those of us adults who like light and nonsensical verse. It's well worth the money and the time. But Smith isn't one of the heavyweights like Shel Silverstein or Dr. Seuss, or X.J. Kennedy, or even a Nancy Willard. There were many pieces that weren't funny or that Smith missed the punchline or the poem just fizzled out. And a few are there to show how clever Smith is. Still many of the pieces were enjoyable as were most of the illustrations. I say if you are buying for a child, pick it up. If you are buying for an adult, go with one of those listed above.	2003-05-21
In the tradition of Byron and Stoker	I love vampire literature and movies, and there is quite a lot in that subgenre, but much of it is bad. And I love poetry. And i love literature and literary theory. But to be honest, I didn't expect much out of Paul Lake's novel. It calls itself a _literary_ vampire mystery, which is a bit pretentious (and Lake is known as a critic an poet, not a fiction writer). I thought anything that bills itself as a literary vampire story...well, let's just say I didn't expect much out of it. And pleasantly, I was surprised (though I shouldn't have been, Lake writes well-done and interesting essays, and he has a knack for the narrative poem, so I know he can tell a good story). It's a well written story with believable characters (half the fun is guessing who the characters are in real life--and believe me, you can recognize many of the poets within) and a well thought out plot. It even has a nice twisted surprise ending. The only gripe I have is that Lake spends too much time complaining about the state of contemporary poetry and how our poets are 'treated' (sometimes I got the impression that he only wrote the novel so he could complain about what all poets already know..and already comlain about). Other than that you get an interesting story that blends poetry, criticism, literary history, and vampires into a great novel (had one of the big publishing companies released this book instead of Story Line Press, more people might be familiar with the book, but unfortunately Story Line, great press that it is, has never had the money to set forth much of an advertising or publicity campaign).	2003-05-21
thank god it's a 'thrift' edition	I expected to really like Lindsay's poetry. I love Chicago and Chicago writers. Vachel Lindsay was a part of the \\"Chicago Renaissance\\" which included the poets Edgar Lee Masters (wrote the Spoon River Anthology, but I'm unfamiliar with his work) and Carl Sandburg, whose work I love. I had hoped with his association with Sandburg... Plus I had previously read \\"Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight\\" which is a superb poem. And \\"The Congo\\" has a great reputation. Lindsay's poetry just wasn't all that great--and I'm not saying that because of the performance pieces. I happen to like performance poetry, if it is well written (Marc Smith is a great example)--poetry is meant to be spoken. ... After all, he was part of the \\"Chicago Renaissance.\\"	2003-05-21
beautifully made  book	Fred Morgan is a much honored man in the world of poetry. He founded and edits one of the most influencial poetry (and fiction and cultural) journals--The Hudson Review. And I think that is what he is respected for and what he'll be remembered for. His poetry isn't that great. I found his New & Selected to be, as a whole, very weak. That's not to say there weren't some good poems (his triolets, \\"Centaurs\\", and \\"From a Forgotten Book\\" to name a few), but not that many. And certainly, we expect more from someone like Frederick Morgan. His generation produced some of our greatest poets-Richard Wilbur, Thom Gunn, Plath, Rhina Espaillat, Miller Williams, Larkin, Bukowski, and of course, Anthony Hecht and Gwendolyn Brooks- but I found his work to be lacking. I will say, U of Ill Press did make a beautiful book (as his Morgan's latest, \\"The Night Sky\\"). It uses quality paper for the cover and the pages, and is bracketed by two thick, almost construction-paperlike blue pages. And the cover is Raphael's Study for the Figure of Poetry, a stunning drawing (also reproduced as the frontspiece). The quality of the book is worth the price. It actually makes up for the poetry (as do the handful of really good poems inside).	2003-05-20
raw emotion	Dorianne Laux is a wonderful poet. I associate her with Kim Addonzio because of there manual on poetry the wrote together, The Poet's Companion, because they are friends, and because their work has a similar feel (though Laux doesn't write in meter and rhyme like Kim does sometimes). There is this raw emotion, but not just flopped on the page like so much bad poetry. In reading this collection, you see what a craftsman Laux is. Her poems feel raw, they feel spontaneous, but they are finely tuned pieces of art. <br />The book is divided into two sections, Smoke and Fire. The first section, Smoke, is the stronger section, with poems like \\"Ray at 14\\", \\"Prayer\\" \\"How It Will Happen, When\\" and others. The poems here feel like smoke when you read them. They touch you lightly, but powerfully, bringing forth all these images, sounds, smells, feelings. Like smoke, they sneak up on you, and then hurt you. <br />\\"What could be more sacred than her eyes,<BR>fierce and complicated as the truth. Your life<BR>rising behind them. Your name on her lips.\\"<BR>         --Prayer<br />\\"Death comes to me again, a girl in a cotton slip\\"<BR>         --Death comes to me again, a girl<br />The second section doesn't differ much. The poems don't come raging at you like fire. No burning here. They are much more like smoke, but it does contain some great work, and has \\"The Shipfitter's Wife,\\" a beautiful poem that was selected for the Best American Poetry 1999 by Robert Bly. I'm just surprised more of her work hasn't appeared there.	2003-05-20
it's my world	...<br />Every so often you come across a poet whose work changes you. For me it was poets like (to name only a few) Robert Frost, Gwendolyn Brooks, Carl Sandburg, Thom Gunn, R.S. Gwynn, Kim Addonizio, Anthony Hecht, and most recently, Everette Maddox. This guy's work is great. His poems are gritty, urban, personal, and without spiraling into the self-pit that the Confessionalists do or going off on poorly written tangents like the Beat poets do. Maddox writes like those groups, and others, wished they could. And he's relatively unknown.  It's hard to put into words what happens in his poetic world. The closest I've come to it is the work of Kim Addonizio. Maddox may be the most important unknown poet we have. If you love any of what I've mentioned--Confessionalists, Beats, Addonizio's poetry, New Orleans (no one has a better feel for the city than Maddox did), great poetry--than you have to read this man's work. Nothing is more real.	2003-05-16
Carver's poetic life	First I have to say that Marilyn Nelson is a wonderful person. And I think she is one of the best poet's of her generation. Her poetry is great, and her book, _The Homeplace_ is one of those books that everyone should own. But even great poets can write mediocre poems. This collection is a series of short poems, usually a dramatic monologue of some sort, that together are supposed to make up the story of George Washington Carver's life (it includes pictures and little biographical footnotes). Pretty much the same thing she did for The Homeplace. It worked in The Homeplace, but not here. The problem isn't so much Nelson's skill as a poet (few are better than her), rather it is Carver's life. It just doesn't make good poetry, or at least not 60 poems. I understand Marilyn wants to tell us about Carver, but perhaps prose would have been a better way to go about it (that and this book seems to be marketed for young children--I don't think they can fully appreciate the nuances of Nelson's poetry or Carver's life). That said, there are several good poems in the book, \\"Clay\\" and \\"Cafeteria Food\\" being my personal favorites. Well, not every collection is going to be great (look at Frost's later books), so I eagerly await the next book from Marilyn Nelson, be it poetry, essays, or fiction.	2003-05-16
pretty good collection	Stephen Dunn won the Pulitzer in 2001 for his collection of poetry, Different Hours. And unlike other Pulitzer winners (Carl Dennis' Practical Gods for example), this one might actually deserve the award. It is a pretty good collection. The poems are lyrical and interesting. Dunn isn't obsure. He doesn't ramble. It's a solid collection, with several really good poems (\\"Evanescence\\", \\"The Death of God\\", \\"Optimism\\", \\"John & Mary\\", \\"returning from an Artist's Studio\\", and \\"Story\\").	2003-04-24
nothing spectacular	One of the editors, Bob Grumman, suggested I read this book as an introduction to visual poetry. I'm not sure how good of an introduction to visual poetry I'd say this book is. Most of the work inside I would call visual art that uses text and words in the piece. There are a few 'visual poems'. But it is subtitled 'visio-textual art' so I guess it delivers on what it claims to. The problem is that most of the work inside isn't very good. This 'poetry' isn't mainstream because of the establishment or The Man keeping them down, it's not well-known because it isn't very good.	2003-04-22
masterful	Neruda is easily one of the 20th centuries greatest poets. The Heights of Macchu Picchu is an excellent poem (Tarn's translation is a good one). It weakens a bit towards the end, but the first 2/3 of the poems is wonderful stuff. And Robert Pring-Mill prefaces this edition with a great essay that really takes you into the meaning of Neruda's poem.	2003-04-21
a great game needs a great guide	Vice City is such a great game that you have to wonder if any strategy guide could live up to it. Plus it is a fairly simple game to understand and play. Some games, like Metal Gear, require the guide, others, like Grand Theft Auto, don't really need it. Now, I've only skimmed through it. I love this game so much that I don't want to spoil it by giving away the upcoming missions and actions. It has a nice intro to the game, the characters, the weapons, and the cars. I find that after you finish a few missions, it is good to go back and look at what the guide says, just in case you missed something. I haven't. What it does have that I like a lot is maps to where all the weapons can be found, where the hidden packages are, where the rampages are, and where you can find body armor, police bribes, and life. (Call it cheating, but that is what I primarily use the guide for, plus this game is so much fun, even reading about it is fun) Those maps alone make the guide a valuable addition to your vice (you wouldn't believe where some of that stuff is hidden). Vice City is so great, you should buy this guide--just to have it.	2003-04-10
is it worth it? maybe. maybe not.	Grand Theft Auto 3 is a fun game to play. It's not as great as Vice City, but it is still one of the better games out there. But, unlike Vice City, which I enjoyed reading about, GTA3 isn't as much fun to read about. The missions are fairly simple, and there are multiple ways to complete them, so the guide isn't the end all be all that it is in games like Metal Gear. You do get good desriptions of weapons and vehicles. And what I find most valuable are the maps to the hidden treasures, rampages, bribes, armor, life, etc. If you are having trouble completeing the game because you can't find all your hidden treasures and rampages, then this guide will solve your problems.	2003-04-10
The more he writes, the worse he gets	I think it is safe to say that Romkey has pretty well mined his vampire stories for all he can get out of them. Don't get me wrong, he started strong. I, Vampire is one of the finest books I'v read--I might be the only person to place it way up on my list of literature. He followed with two pretty good book, The Vampire Papers and The Vampire Princess, both well-written novels, though not of the caliber of I, Vampire. Then came two weak editions to his series, The Vampire Virus and Vampire Hunter. And now we have The London Vampire Panic, another weak edition to his work. It seems Romkey is running out of ideas. The first and last thirds of the book drag. The middle gets pretty good. There is the nice addition of Van Helsing--not the first time he's appeared in someone else's fiction, but Romkey throws a nice twist on the character (well done Mr. Romkey). But overall the book drags. And you can see where Romkey wants the reader to think of Stoker's Dracula. Roughly same time period, set in London, similar style, and Romkey tells the story through various letters and journal entries. But Romkey is no Stoker. I say stick with what you do best-- I, Vampire. But I think it might be time for Romkey to move on to new subject material.	2003-04-09
a great disappointment	The Best American Essays is one of those anthologies that I wait eagerly (highlight eagerly) every year. And nine times out of ten, it doesnt disappoint. So when I came across the inaugural edition (1986) at a used book store, I picked it up, and couldnt wait to get home to read it, especially since it included essays by Joseph Brodsky, Robert Fitzgerald, Stephen Jay Gould, Joyce Carol Oates, and Gore Vidal (among other great writers). Imagine my surprise when I read it and found that this was not a very good collection of essays. One would think that you would work especially hard to make the inaugural edition to be a phenomenal collection. But it was not. Barthelmes essay was disjointed and made little sense, and the essays by Cockburn, Brodsky, Fitzgerald, Gass, Wain, and Kennan were just plain dull. There were a couple of bright spots (well, more like dull twinkles in a sea of blahs): Gerald Earlys essay on Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Stitt was pretty interesting and fairly well written; Oates essay On Boxing; and Gore Vidals touching remembrance of Italo Calvino. What was nice to see in this collection was that the essays varied over a huge range of topics, and that no magazine dominated the collection (in fact, only The New Republic had two essays, every other magazine only had one). Id have to say the best section of this collection is Robert Atwans (series editor) forward (no, not the Introduction by the guest editor, the 3 page forward), where he eloquently describes the art of essay writing. Its a shame the rest of the essays werent as good.	2003-03-23
great collection	Of all the annual `best of' anthologies, Houghton Mifflin's Best American Science and Nature Writing has to be the best. I know it has only been out a few years, but in every anthology, 90% of the essays are phenomenal. In the 2000 edition I thought only Wendell Berry's and Wendy Johnson's essays didn't belong (I'm not sure that you could qualify Johnson's piece as science or nature writing). Otherwise you have great pieces by Natalie Angier, Richard Conniff, Paul de Palma, Helen Epstein, Anne Fadiman, Atul Gawande, Brian Hayes, Edward Hoagland, Judith Hooper, Ken Lamberton, Peter Matthiessen, Cullen Murphy, Richard Preston, Oliver Sacks, Hampton Sides, Craig B. Stanford, and Gary Taubes (most of them I had never heard of). And they range over all aspects of science, nature, and technology. Great collection.	2003-03-23
stunning ending	In this day and age we have more to fear from a biological holocaust than nuclear destruction (though it is still there), but Fail-Safe helps to bring back the terror of the Cold War. It's Dr. Strangelove without the humor (yes, I know Strangelove was based on another book). It's a what if scenario, an accident. There is no one to blame. No one went mad. A simple accident, that starts the bombs on their way. This book is tragic, and written full of tension. But the best part is how it ends, which is too good for me to spoil here. This book is worth reading if only for the last few pages. And to make you ask yourself, 'What would I do?'	2003-03-23
an uneven collection	Of the group of poets that studied under Miller Williams in the 70s, Adamo is my least favorite of the group. There were several good poems in the collection (and I think \\"Old Numbers\\" and especially \\"My Answer\\" are among the finest contemporary poems), but I found most of the poems to mediocre or just didn't make any sense.	2003-03-22
i might be a bit generous with the stars	I've found the O. Henry Awards series to be a pretty uneven collection of stories, but still one i eagerly await each year, because in each volume you find several good stories, and one or two gems. The 1999 collection is no exception. Sure I found most of the stories to be trite and dull, but hidden amongst the poorer work were really good stories by W.D. Wetherell, Michael Chabon, Charlotte Forbes, and Annie Proulx. And the second place story, Cary Holladay's 'Merry-Go-Sorry' is a great story that deserves to be anthologized many, many in the years to come. And Stephen King and Lorrie Moore's introduction were eloquently written, and a joy to read in their own right.	2003-03-22
always a joy to read	Matheson's I Am Legend is one of my favorite books--one I've read over and over, and always find something new to cherish about it. This is a book I highly recommend. Not just becuase it is entertaining and well written, but I Am Legend is a staple of both the horror and science fiction genres. But it is more than that. It is also one of the finer Apocalyptic novels (or novellas) written. And I believe might even deserve a place (no matter how small) in the sub-genrea of Utopian fiction. Matheson does a wonderful job of helping us understand the horrors of the end of the world, being alone, and even the sympathetic side of being a vampire (all with almost no dialogue). It's a beautifully written book.	2003-03-22
a great classic	Nevil Shute's classic book 'On the Beach' looks at the end of the world from a different angle--a nuclear war has raged in the Northern Hemisphere, over in a month, but because of the winds the radiation is slowly covering the Southern Hemisphere, none of which were involved in the war. It's the story of the last days on Earth as experienced by the innocent Australians. It is a sad book, down to the core. And you will find tears welling in your eyes as the characters of the novel attempt to deal with their upcoming fate. It's a story of love, hope, redemption, sorrow, and peace. this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone.	2003-02-26
not very mysterious	I don't buy the Best American Mystery Stories every year (like I do for the Best American Short Stories, Essays, Science and Nature Writing, and now Nonrequired Reading). What I do is glance at the editor and at the authors included within. This year's edition is edited by James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential and the rest of his L.A. Quartet). And it has a story by Joe Lansdale, \\"The Mule Rustlers\\" --which is a great story, with a nice, humorous twist at the end-- (Lansdale is the greatest Texas writer whose name isn't McMurtry); and a story by Joyce Carol Oates, \\"The High School Sweetheart\\"--which is a story very much in her style, and somewhat 'experimental', but isn't as good as what she normally does. The best two stories in this year's volume is Brendan Dubois' \\"A Family Game\\" (great twist of an ending) and Daniel Waterman's \\"A Lepidopterist's Tale\\", which really only kicks in at the end, and reminds me of an Oates story. Stuart M. Kaminsky, Fred Melton, Annette Meyers, Michael Connelly, Thomas H. Cook, Sean Doolittle, and Joe Gores also have good stories within. What detracts from the collection: the fact that while these may be good stories, there isn't a whole lot of mystery to them; John Biguenet's dull story \\"It Is Raining in Bejucal\\"; David Edgerley Gates' mediocre \\"The Blue Mirror\\"; James Grady's unreadable \\"The Championship of Nowhere\\"; amd F.X. Toole's story \\"Midnight Emissions\\", which I was unable to finish. When reading the collection you'll notice an unusual amount of sports stories--mainly baseball and boxing stories (or maybe not surprising since Otto Penzler edited the two books those stories came from). <br />If you are looking for really good 'mystery' stories, you probably want to move along, but there are 11 really good stories (that's over half) to read. Some you would call mystery, some you wouldn't.	2003-02-26
a new year of science	The Best American Science and Nature Writing series is always a great joy to pick up. This is the way to keep up with general science without spending hundreds of dollars on magazines and journals (well, not really, but it is a good series of books to read). This year Natalie Angier, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of _Woman: An Intimate Geography_ is the guest editor. None of the essays stand out as newborn classics, but they are good essays. And they cover the range of fields. <br />Anthropology - Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's \\"Mothers and Others\\" <br />Biology - Frederick C. Crews' \\"Saving Us from Darwin\\" originally published in The New York Review of Books (Crews attacks every form of creationism and the blending of science and religion, including Gould, but offers us no alternative idea or solution-that's what kept this essay from being an instant classic); H. Bruce Franklin's \\"The Most Important Fish in the Sea\\" (ecology/conservation science); Gordon Grice's \\"Is That a Mountain Lion in Your Backyard?\\"; \\"The Dirt in the New Machine\\" by Blaine Harden (which is both an ecology and technology essays); \\"Life's Rocky Start\\", an essay on the origin of life on earth and the importance of minerals, by Robert M. Hazen; Anne Matthews' \\"Wall Street Losses, Wall Street Gains\\" which is about birdwatching and the World Trade Towers; Chet Raymo \\"A Little Reminder of Reality's Scale\\" (a brief piece from the Boston Globe); Peter Stark's embarrassing piece (at least he should be embarrassed by this half poorly written `fiction' with facts on jellyfish-the most poisonous one there is) titled \\"The Sting of the Assassin\\"; Joy Williams' \\"One Acre\\" about her little plot in Florida that she tried to keep ecologically safe and sound<br />Medicine - Barbara Ehrenreich's essay about her fight with breast cancer \\"Welcome to Cancerland\\" (a great essay that is also included in the Best American Essays\\"; Gary Greenberg's touching essay \\"As Good as Dead\\" (about a young boy who has a brain tumor in his head and his incredible courage to continue living and dreaming and planning for his future); Judith Newman's\\"I Have Seen Cancer's Disappear\\"<br />Psychology - Roy F. Baumeister's \\"Violent Pride\\" (written in a pseudo-highschool-science fair report style. This could have been a great study, but...): Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Examined Life\\" (about the SATs and test taking); \\"Dumb, Dumb, Duh Dumb\\" by Steve Mirsky (again, about our test scores); Daniel Smith \\"Shock and Disbelief\\" which is about ECT of things-yes, the pros of electroconvulsive therapy<br />Physics - K.C. Cole's \\"Mind Over Matter\\" (originally in the L.A. Times); the heavy material of Dark Matter by Karen Wright (\\"Very Dark Energy\\" which first appeared in Discover<br />Computers - Clive Thompson's \\"The Know-It-All Machine\\" which goes into artificial intelligence<br />And the others: Burkhard  Bilger's essay on eating odd animals, \\"Braised Shank of Free-Range Possum\\"; \\"In the Realm of Virtual Reality\\" by Richard Conniff and Harry Marshall, which discusses pseudozoology (creatures like the Yeti and such); Garret Keizer's essay on sound and noise, \\"Sound and Fury\\" (from Harper's); Verlyn Klinkenborg's odd newspaper column, \\"The Pursuit of Innocence in the Golden State\\", which is about California, but more on a two sentence sociological statement; Robert Kunzig's \\"Ripe for Controversy\\" which discusses cheese and health regulations' Dennis Overbye's \\"How Islam Won, and Lost, the Lead in Science\\" ; Eric Schlosser's \\"Why McDonald's Fries Taste So Good\\"<br />and above all, these essays are easy enough for the layperson, but good for the expert as well.	2003-02-26
not a very good gimmick	This book is another gimmick from Stephen King, but unlike his other, more successful gimmicks, this one he didn't write himself. You pretty much have to watch the mini series Rose Red in order to really enjoy this book. It's written in a diary form, and is presented as the real thing (edited by fictional characters created by King). It's not really that poorly written, it's just not that great. Nor does it add to the experience of watching King's mini series. I'd say pass on it, even for the hardcore King fans.	2003-02-13
I love this book	I'm probably one of the few people who would rank this book up there with the best ever written. I might be the only person. But it is a great book, one I've read several times. Romkey takes the vampire tale and gives it a new twist. The first half of the novel, when David Parker first becomes a vampire, is a very lyrical novel. And the second half turns into more of an action sequence. And the two halves work well together. Romkey brings back just about every important historical figure, but it does keep it interesting. I've read most of what Romkey has written, including the other books in this 'series' and nothing else he has written reaches this level (that's not to say that his other book aren't enjoyable, most of them are good). I can't recommend this novel enough. It's great, and I think it should be one of those few books that everyone should read.	2003-01-26
Neal Simon did it better	Heller's memoir isn't badly written. It's more that his life is rather dull. Most of the book focuses on his childhood in Coney Island, where he has no bad memories and no exciting ones. The Depression didn't affect him. His father's death didn't affect him. Nothing affected him. And not much happened. As a result, the memoir tends to drag out. Chapters 8 and 9, titled 'Peace' and Psychiatry' respectively, were very good. That's the period of the war and afterward. Those are the chapters that get into his writing, and this is where the memoir picks up (though it drags again in the final chapter, when we go back to Coney Island and more discussion on what happened to the people he grew up with--which is to say, nothing interesting). And there is little insight into Catch-22 (and if you are Joseph Heller, Catch-22 is the most important thing you've done, an instant classic, and what everyone knows you for--there should have been more of a focus on it), which is truly a shame.	2003-01-26
definitely a classic in the genre	I'd give five stars for Nine Princes of Amber alone. It is such a great book (check out my review for it). Zelazny created an interesting series with the Amber chronicles. It's well-written and highly entertaining. There are 10 books, and they divide into 2 groups of five. The first five books deal with Corwin and his adventures in Amber. Theseare the better of the books. The last of the books deal with Merlin, Corwin's son, and what happens to him in Amber. You can tell that ther were some years between Corwin's adventure and Merlin's. And Zelazny's style changes. Corwin's books are in a more 'high' style, whereas Merlin's books feel more like a contemporary writer. The language changes. As good as Merlin's books are, I think Corwin's books are the best and it would have been stronger if Zelazny had stopped writing before he took up Merlin's saga. But still, this series is highly imaginitive, well written, and very entertaining.	2003-01-26
eh...	I'm gonna say that this isn't a bad strategy guide, though it is far from the best I've seen.I've looked through it and it covers the maps, levels, and enmies fairly well. And it looks like it would do the job. The problem is that the actual game isn't much fun, mostly because of its gameplay. The guide isn't organized all that greatly, but it will do the job if you are stuck somewhere (yeah, it doesn't give away too many secrets).	2003-01-24
This is what a strategy guide is all about	Not to be Captain Obvious here, but in discussing a strategy guide, the most important thing is the game. Not to worry though, Metal Gear Solid is a classic game (still good even though its sequels and a new game system has come out). It has a great story, great gameplay, and great graphics. Because it doesn't matter how good a strategy guide is (it could be the Holy Grail of strategy guides) if the game [isnt great]. So, onto the guide. This is a great strategy guide. It's good for the beginner (and will walk you through the game) or for the more advanced player (and will help when you get stuck). It has maps, tips, hints, backstory (and it is a good one), and discusses the characters. There's an interview with the creators and the upper levels are in a sealed part of the book, so you can't accidentally see it if you don't want to. This is the Holy Grail of strategyguides. If you have a Playstation or Playstation 2 (and you should by now) or any system that has this game (I'm not sure if others do), then you need to get the game and the guide.	2003-01-24
weak collection	I've picked up the last few years worth of the Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards, and usually I'm not disappointed, but this year I was. I've read most of volumes Dark has edited, and usually I agree with him on most if not all the stories, but I found this year's selection to be different. There are some good stories in the volume, but most of the stories are mediocre, dull, or just plain bad. But one bad volume doesn't spoil it for me. I still eagerly wait for next year's selection.	2003-01-18
excellent work	Betty Adcock's poetry is truly wonderful. She writes with clarity, grace, humor, and anyone who reads her poems, can't help but love them. This book has some of the best poems written, like \\"Southbound\\" and \\"Voyages\\". This book is a must for every person who loves southern poetry, and I recommend it for anyone who loves poetry.	2003-01-13
another year's :&quot;best of&quot;	I admire what Houghton Mifflin is trying to do with the Best American Series. But oftentimes I have to wonder about their selection of stories. Yes, most of the stories in this collection are good, and a few are even great, and a few are bad (Caroly Cooke's 'The Sugar-Tit'; Beth Lordan's &quot;Digging&quot;; Meg Mullins &quot;The Rug&quot;). Now here comes the but... But I don't know if you could call them the best of the year. When I started picking up these books a few years ago I was very excited, but as time goes on the stories sort of blend together. Someone below said 'creeping sameness'. I honestly can't say anything more apt about the collection.<br />It takes more than an impressive list of names to make a collection of the 'best of'.	2003-01-13
Iron Bly	For such a well known name and prolific poet, translator, writer, and all around tough guy, his poetry sure isn't very good. And it is much better performed than on the page. I could go on slamming him and his work, but I'd rather focus on the three poems in the collection that I actually liked.<br />\\"Driving to Town Late to Mail a Letter\\"<BR>This first poem has no meat to it. But it is a nice image, and sort of gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling inside. It's actually short enough to quote it in full here:<br />It is a cold and snowy night. The main street is deserted.<BR>The only things moving are swirls of snow.<BR>As i lift the mailbox door, I feel its cold iron.<BR>There is a privacy I love in this snowy night.<BR>Driving around, I will waste more time.<br />see, warm and fuzzy.<br />\\"Waking on the Farm\\"<BR>This poem is by far the best in the collection. It feels like Bly's attempt at being Frostian. You get a nice image of the farm, and once again Bly evokes a warm and fuzzy feeling. He also gives some great lines: 'how the stubble,/ A little proud with frost' and 'Breathing seemed frail and daring in the morning.' That's good poetry, and it is a shame that more of Bly's work isn't like that.<br />\\"The Resemblance Between Your Life and a Dog\\"<BR>This poem, my least favorite of the three, but still one I like very much, does just what it says. Compares a person's life with the actions of a dog. It's both funny and a little sad.<br />I'm going to say that you could easily pass on this book. You can find the best of Bly somewhere on the internet and print it up rather than spending the money.	2003-01-13
weak	Cisneros created The House on Mango Street, which is in my opinion, one of the great modern masterpieces. I'm not familiar with her other fiction, so I don't know if she is a one hit wonder or not. I do know that her poetry is not very well done. I don't know, I expected a group of sensual or sexual poems along the lines of Sarah Cortez or Kim Addonizio. What I got were substandard poems, that were a pain to try to read. Pass this collection on by and pick up Cortez's How to Undress a Cop or any poetry collection by Kim Addonizio.	2003-01-09
a mixed bag	Wolfe's collection 'Hooking Up' is described as a book that talks about sex, courtship, and the 'hooking up' of males and females in today's society. It's not exactly that. What it is, is a collection of essays and fiction collected by Wolfe and thrown together. Nothing wrong with that, but I want to make sure no one is fooled like I was. That being said, it is a pretty good collection of work. It's divided into five parts. <br />Part 1 (Hooking Up) contains the title essay, one which deals with sex and courtship, then and now. Wolfe doesn't deliver anything new or shocking here. <br />Part 2 (The Human Beast) contains 3 essays. The first deals with the rise of Pentium and the silicon revolution. Wolfe's skill as a journalist is evident here, but the reading is a bit slow. Both of the other essays deal with the digital revolution. It's a topic Wolfe can write about, but not one that is enjoyable to read.<br />Part 3 (Vita Robusta, Ars Anorexica) contains four essays. My favorite piece that I've read by Wolfe is \\"My Three Stooges.\\" Wolfe uses his wit to poke fun at Updike, Mailer, and John Irving, who attacked Wolfe's _A Man in Full_ when it was published. It's a great essay, and you see Wolfe's talents in full. I loved it. There is also his essay \\"The Invisible Artist\\" which contains Wolfe's thought on 'modern art' and the sculptor who designed the sculpture at the Viet Nam Memorial and other works we all recognize, but don't know the artist (and even, as Wolfe points out, may not consider the works art). <br />The next section contains Wolfe's novells \\"Ambush at Fort Bragg\\", which is the only fiction in the collection, but it's a good story. <br />The final section is 'The New Yorker Affair' in which Wolfe spoofed the New Yorker by doing a profile of their editor. It's a great section. <br />The New Yorker Affair, Ambush at Fort Bragg, and my favorite essay \\"My Three Stooges\\" show Wolfe at his best, and they alone are worth the price of the collection. And I'm sureyou'll get some enjoyment out of the other pieces as well.	2003-01-09
still going strong	This year's installment of the Best American Essays is a great selection (but then aren't they always). It was one of the last projects Stephen Jay Gould finished before he died last May. Of course there are all kinds of arguments that can be made for and against certain selections being included and not included. <br />Three essays really got to me as the best of the bunch (and essays that I imagine I'll reread again and again in the future). The first is Franzen's essay on his father's decline in Alzheimer's. It's a touching essay that is well-written, humorous at times, and helps to understand the `human' reaction to the disease. The other essays is Bernard Cooper's \\"Winner Take Nothing\\" which is a very funny interplay between a father and son who don't understand each other. I remember reading it in GQ, and thinking that this essay surely would be selected for the Best American series. Nicholas Delbanco's essay \\"The Countess of Stanlein Restored\\" is a wonderfully written essay that covers the history of violin making and the restoration of one of the more famous violins, and anyone who loves music will love this essay. <br />Barbara Ehrenreich has an essay discussing her ordeal with breast cancer, and what makes this essay so good is that it isn't all the hopefulness and joy you find in others of its type, rather she deals with the real emotions she felt-the bitterness. And with an almost tongue-in-cheek humor. Sebastion Junger has his `typical' style essay dealing with the fight for freedom in Afganistan. It's well-written, like his work tends to be. Andrew Levy's essay on Robert Carter III shows why we don't know who Carter is-he just isn't quite interesting enough to write about. There's also an interesting essay by Danielle Ofri on one incident in her medical school training (this essay has convinced me to pick up her collection of memoir essays on med school). There's a great essay by Darryl Pinckney dealing with a middle-aged, middle-class black man getting busted for marijuana possession. It's funny and frightening at the same time. Typical New Yorker material though. Gore Vidal has an essay on McVeigh-which is at times well-written, but at other times borders on the paranoid and juvenile. It is an interesting read though. And the final essay of the collection is Wolfson's \\"Moonrise\\" which is another autobiographical essay dealing with the illness of a relative-this one of her son. It's a touching essay that fills the reader with sadness and joy. <br />Some of the weaker essays are: Jacques Barzun's \\"The Tenth Muse\\" which is part biography of Clifton Fadiman and part question on culture, but doesn't ever say anything. And there are the group of obligatory 9-11essays, though not the best I've seen. Amy Kolen has an extremely dull essay, \\"Fire,\\" which I found so boring, I couldn't even finish it.	2003-01-09
Mark's story	Levine selected My Alexandria for the National Poetry Series a few years ago. And after reading this collection, you can see why it is Doty's best. It's a grim collection, focusing on death and grief, but an elegant one. \\"Bill's Story\\" alone is worth the price of the book. This is a book for anyone who loves poetry or has had AIDS tough their life. Good work Mr. Doty.	2003-01-09
disapointing	I always eagerly await new works by Stephen King. He's written some great novels and short stories, and his Dark Tower books and the Bachman Books I place on my list of greatest works written, but this novel was such a disapointment. This really would have been a better idea for a short story than a novel. The story kept building to something, and then it would fizzle, before it tried to build again, before ending on a fizzle. King tried too hard to keep this from being Christine, and he suceeded there. This is a substandard story. It's an example of trying to hard to be something it isn't. It's an interesting premise--one that should have been handled in the short story format, or novella at the longest.	2003-01-09
awesome for what it is	Cisneros has created true masterpiece of contemporary American literature. The House on Mango Street is a series of interrelated vignettes (keep that in mind: these are not short stories, they are vignettes) that captures the love, joy, family, sorrow, and both hopefullness and hopelessness of growing up a Latina girl. This collection has already been accepted into the canon, and can only become more loved and respected as more young people come across it.	2003-01-09
not as good as being there, but has to be close	I keep thinking I was born at the wrong time. I missed the expatriat scene of Fitzgerald and Hemingway, the Beats, and Kesey and his counterculture scene. Wolfe's book may not be as good as being there, but it does help those of us born far too late to understand and enjoy the scene. Wolfe writes sympathetically and pretty much from the point of view of the Pranksters, as if he had been there for all of it (he wasn't). Wolfe is a fine journalist, and he does a great job here. I think this is a very important book, and I recommend it along with: Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; Babbs' On the Bus (a nonfictional account of the bus trip); Burroughs' Junky; Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums; and Hunter Thompson's Hell's Angels (which I read right after Wolfe's book). Together they might help the late born Beat understand and live in the world they missed.	2003-01-09
great selection of poems	Charles Martin's selected poems come from thirty years of writing poetry, and the skill he has is evident. Martin has a formal control over his poetry that isn't seen much today, and his use of language is exquisit. The selection contains translations, poems on pop culture, poems that touch on the deeper levels of being human, and selections from his long narrative 'Passages from Friday' (the Robinson Crusoe story told from Friday's perspective). These poems are not only a wonderful selection of poems, but great examples of technical skill.	2003-01-09
a well written sociological piece of journalism	Hunter Thompson brings us underground journalism. Hunter Thompson brings us gonzo journalism. But he can be serious, while not losing that 'underground' quality. No, Hell's Angels isn't the wild ride Fear and Loathing was, but a more serious study of the Hell's Angels, and who and what, and more importantly, why they are. There is plenty of drugs and alcohol in the book, but not is the style of writing. Thompson writes very straightforward, very serious (and very entertainingly). You can tell he took his topic seriously, and wants us to do so as well. All the way through his 'ending': the beating he took that ended his time with the Hell's Angels. If you are interested in outlaws, or if you are interested in Thompson's work, or if you liked Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests, then you'll love this book. I highly recommend it.	2003-01-09
an analysis of Nosferatu	Longman and York Press have put together a short, concise, simple to understand text on one of our earliest film masterpieces. If you love Murnau's Nosferatu, then this slim volume will only increase your understanding and enjoyment of the film. It covers background and story information, discussions on the filmmaking process, and various interpretations of the film. It's a wonderful book for the film.	2003-01-09
ink on ink	Addonizio's and Dumesnil's anthology on writings on tattoos is a great collection of work. You can't go wrong with the writings inside. <br />There is some great (and at times surprising) fiction inside, which includes: an excerpt from Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man, Kafka's \\"In the Penal Colony,\\" Sylvia Plath's story \\"The Fifteen Dollar Eagle,\\" and Flannery O'Connor's \\"Parker's Back.\\" O'Connor is always a joy to read, and this story is an especially good one. There's even a piece from Herman Melville (selected from Typee). Steve Vender has a most interesting piece on meeting one of the gang members he is to defend--this is a fascinating piece. And there are also vignettes scattered throughout where people discuss their tattoos, as well as other pieces of fiction. <br />And there's poetry by Thom Gunn, Kim Addonizio, Bob Hicok, Mark Doty, Cheryl Dumesnil, J.D. McClatchy, Tony Hoagland, Brenda Hillman, Laura A. Goldstein, Garnett Kilberg Cohen, Michael Waters, Joseph Millar, Katharine Whitcomb, Eliot Wilson, Bruce Bond, Virginia Chase Sutton, Lissette Mendez, Dzvinia Orlowsky, and Denise Duhamel. <br />Not only does it look impressive, it reads very, very well. I'm not surprised that Addonizio put together such a strong selection of work. I can't think of any other person who would have been more suited to this type of anthology. It's a great collection, one I'm sure everyone would enjoy reading.	2003-01-09
kerouac's attempt at being James Joyce	Jack Kerouac was one of the most dynamic figures in literary history. He was also one of America's greatest authors--he gave us two of the finest books written, _On the Road_ and _The Dharma Bums_, but _Big Sur_ shows that even he could write poorly. Big Sur is a stream of consciousness novel ... that deals with his alcoholism--though looking at the way Kerouac died, writing it taught him nothing. It doesn't contain the energy or the story that we find in On the Road of Dharma Bums. It's Kerouac's attempt at postmodernism and at showing us what his alcoholism was like. Kerouac is successful in that the confusion and nonlinear narrative does effectively show the confusion (...) of his alcoholism, but as a work of literature, it just fell short. I suppose the book is important in its portrayal of alcoholism and as a piece of Kerouac's work, but it just wasn't that enjoyable, and I was happy when it ended. <br />A final note, Kerouac closes the novel with his (too) long poem \\"Sea\\" which was written when the events of this novel took place. It's a bad poem... <br />On the back cover Ginsberg says some wonderful, and true things about Kerouac's writing. But Big Sur doesn't seem to fit the bill.	2003-01-08
a european masterpiece	If you ever take the time to discuss the truly great masterworks of world literature, almost without fail, Flaubert's Madame Bovary will be mentioned as one of the finest examples of literature available (even Nabokov's *lectures* on the novel have become famous). So many of our great writers use Bovary as an example of the novel at its finest. I don't think I'd go quite that far, but it is a great novel. The characters are really nothing special--which is what makes this novel so special. Flaubert manages to write a novel about ordinary people, and yet captivates us. It is a story about love and happiness, or lack thereof. It is a story of adultery, though not as racy as I expected, considering all the controversy it caused. And it is the first story of credit card debt (ah yes, the story of my life). It's well written, though it slows in the beginning and ending of the novel. It's a great work of art.	2003-01-08
A great beginning to a great saga	I started reading Zelazny's Saga of Amber five or six years ago. I never finished the series (i only got about half way through), but it was something I knew I'd pick up at a later date and read (and now I've purchased the Great Book of Amber, which contains all ten books in the saga, and I'm currently reading it). Zelazny published the first book, Nine Princes in Amber, in 1970. And it turned out to be not only well written, but one of the most original ideas in the world of fantasy (like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series, Jordan's The Wheel of Time, Weiss & Hickman's collaborations, the Dark Elf books of R.A. Salvatore, and so on). The book deals with a family fighting for control of the known world, Amber, and all other worlds, which are 'shadows' of Amber. The reader visits many different worlds, we get swordplay, intrigue, and a cast of great characters. And Zelazny writes in the first person, told from one the brothers, Corwin. But in the beginning, Corwin has amnesia, and doesn't know who he is, or the story of his family. It makes for a great voice and helps keep the reader in a state of suspense and 'knowledgable' confusion, that isn't seen elsewhere in the series, or in many other books. The chronicles of Amber is a highly original, well written series, and Nine Princes of Amber is the best of them.	2002-11-22
strong work	Sarah Cortez is a poet, teacher, and cop in Houston, Texas. Her work is tough, sensual, and very sexual. Her job as a cop and her Latina heritage flavor her poems. This is a beautiful piece of work from a poet who has a lot of potential to be great. She has the flavor of those 'bad girl' poets (like Kim Addonizio, Dorianne Laux, and their matriarch-Edna St. Vincent Millay). This is a strong collection, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.	2002-10-08
The Inaugural Edition	This year the Best American Series created a new volume: The Best American Nonrequired Reading. Michael Cart (My Father's Scar) is the series editor, and Dave Eggers is the guest editor. And considering it's Eggers, this volume should do well. It contains some good stories and articles. What hurts it the most is a lack of continuity. It's hard to figure out just what falls into the category of 'nonrequired reading,' even after reading the introductions and the collection. It is a combination of fiction and essays, and seems to have a humourous and experimental slant. It also seems to be directed, as the editors say, to the younger generation, those that fall between 15 and 25 (but good essays and fiction are good for all ages). Most selections come from 'alternative' sources, but there are a few that first appeared in The New Yorker and Esquire and the likes. Still, it is tough to figure out exactly what the criteria for being chosen for this volume is. Even so, it is a good volume of work, well worth reading (like the Best American series tends to be). <br />The essays/articles in the volume cover a wide range. There is humor (Jenny Bitner's \\"The Pamphleteer\\"; Seth Mnookin's \\"The Nice New Radicals\\"; \\"Jiving With Your Teen\\" by Seaton Smith; and two selections from The Onion). There's an essay (\\"Generation Exile\\") about Tibet, drugs (\\"Speed Demons\\" which concerns methamphetamine use in Thai), illegal aliens (Kamber's \\"Toil and Temptation\\") and their adjustment to America. Sara Corbett's poignant essay \\"The Lost Boys\\" (from The New York Times Upfront) about refugees from Africa, and their culture shock and adjustment of coming to America (Minnesota no less). Eric Schlosser's \\"Why McDonald's Fries Taste So Good\\" is here. And there are the essays that don't quite fit (Finkel's essay from the New York Times Magazine about the battle in Afghanistan- pre Sept 11; Gary Smith's \\"Higher Education\\", which is an article from Sports Illustrated about a high school coach who comes to a small Mennonite community and opens their eyes and hearts ). Overall the essays shoot for a younger audience and one that is more Eco or Libertarian. I found the essays to be pretty weak, overall. There are some good ones, but these feel like rejects for the sister publication, Best American Essays. <br />And for fiction there is Sam Lipsyte's \\"Snacks\\" about a youth's alienation because of obesity; Elizabeth McKenzie's great story \\"Stop That Girl\\" which covers a child who feels she is being replaced by her mother's new husband and baby, and this story has a great ending; Keith Pille's \\"Journal of a New COBRA Recruit\\" from McSweeneys.net, which is a hilarious short about a youth joining COBRA (from G.I. Joe) and his training, and this one is very funny; Rodney Rothman's \\"My Fake Job\\" from The New Yorker is a hilarious account of a man pretending to work somewhere-you have to read it to truly appreciate it (and it caused a bit of controversy from the New Yorker; David Schickler's \\"Fourth Angry Mouse\\"; \\"Blood Poison\\" by Heidi Jon Schmidt (which contains a dark undercurrent, probably of molestation); the always hilarious Dave Sedaris with his \\"To Make a Friend, Be a Friend\\" from Esquire. The final two selections, both fiction, of the volume definitely fall under the experimental. Adrian Tomine's comic, \\"Bomb Scare\\" from Optic Nerve #8 is here. It is somewhat disjointed and the title doesn't fit, but it is a story of troubled teens. And then there are selections from \\"Please Don't Kill the Freshman\\" written by a h.s. freshman girl, who goes under the pseudonym `Zoe Trope.' This one is self published and pretty bad. Very disjointed, and once again, troubled teen. The fiction runs the range from the bad to the really good, but most fall in the middle range. They seem like the selections that didn't quite made the Best American Short Stories cut (except for Sedaris, Rothman, and Pille). <br />And there is just bad work in here: Camden Joy's \\"Hubcap Diamondstar Halo.\\"<br />But the volume is only [$$$], and for your money, you do get some good reading in.	2002-10-07
a confessionalist novel	Let me first say that in rating this novel, I waffled back and forth between 4 and 5 stars. I finally decidedo n 4 stars, but it could just as easily have been 5.<br />Sylvia Plath made a name for herself with her poetry and this, her only novel. She was one of the confessionalist poets, along with Anne Sexton, she studied with Robert Lowell. The Bell Jar carries her confessionalistic work into fiction. This is based pretty heavily on her life. The Bell Jar is like a Catcher in the Rye for girls. It's pretty well written, though you can tell it is an inexperienced novelist. It is a shame she killed herself so young, because not only was she a great poet, but she had such potential to become a great fiction writer. Plath successfully carries us down into insanity with her protagonist. The narration works very well in keeping the reader as disjointed as our heroin (It's similiar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in that matter, only not to the extreme--and it paints a prettier and more approving picture of the mental health system of the time). We never get a good idea as to why the breakdown occurs, but as in real life, these matters are often confusing. My biggest problem with the book isn't the somewhat juvenile style of writing, but it is the ending of the novel. It seems a little to pat. We don't feel that the narrator has worked through her problems, or that her mental health should be better, it just sort of becomes better. Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending. But it is a fine novel, one that I enjoyed.	2002-10-02
some of the best american stories-but a poor edition of them	Hawthorne is one of the greatest short story writers of the English language--of any language. I won't go into too much detail of the stories that make up Twice-Told Tales (I'm saving that for the Library of America edition), but I want to take a minute to talk about this Reader's Digest Edition. It only contains the 'Twice-Told Tales', but those are some of Hawthorne's best known stories: 'The Minister's Black Veil' and 'Dr. Heidegger's Experiment'. It's a well made volume with nine illustrations  that aren't very well done. Really, you are better off getting the Library of America edition of Hawthorne's Tales and Sketches. It's more complete, better crafted, and doesn't have those horrid illustrations. What is interesting about this edition are two reviews contained. One by Poe and the other by Longfellow. Unfortunately they are here 'in an adapted form' which is a problem Reader's Digest seems to have. It's nice to have them here, but it would be nicer if they were in the original form. I give a five for the stories, but a 2 for the Reader's Digest edition. So I've settled on a three for this review.	2002-09-30
one flew east, one flew west....	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the greatest novels written. Certainly Kesey's best and the best to come out of the counterculture movement of the 60s. The book is told from the point of view of Chief, who has schizophrenia. This causes the pov to be skewed, and a certain amount of distrust in the narrator (is Big Nurse really that bad, or is it Chief's illness?) It's a heroic story, McMurphy being our (anti)hero. There's so much going on in the book, you could write a book analyizing it. I will say that if you liked the fiction of the Beats or Hunter Thompson, you'll definitely like this novel. It is also told in one of the most intersting voices - along with novels like Huck Finn, Great Gatsby, Catcher in the Rye. This i definitely one of the best novels written.<br />I have the Viking Critical Edition of the book. Besides a great introduction, a chronology of Kesey's life, and the text, there are also three other sections, topics for discussion and paper, and a selected bibliography. <br />Section 2 contains letters from Kesey, and selections concerning Cuckoo's Nest from Kesey's Garage Sale. There are Kesey's sketches of what he visualized the characters to look like and an early draft of the opening sequence of the story. There's also an excerpt from Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.<br />Section 3 contains literary criticism of the the novel, and these are some great selections of the work done on Kesey's novel.<br />Section 4 is called analogies and perspectives. It contains scientific articles on lobotomy and shock treatment. It's a great addition to a critical edition, and one that you don't see done elsewhere. There are also excerpts from Dale Wasserman's play One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ellison's Invisible Man (chapter 11), Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, and Jack Kerouac's On the Road (where Sal and Dean meet). And there is a sketch of Neal Cassady written by Kesey (taken from Kesey's Garage Sale), which is great to comparewith Kerouac's Dean Moriaty. <br />Cuckoo's Nest is one of the masterpieces of American literature, one everyone should read. And the Viking Critical Edition is a great edition to have. I'd recommend getting this edition of the book, but if not, at least pick up another edition. This is great stuff.	2002-09-30
stunning work	I had high expectations for this book. The reviews are all good. Everyone who I know who's read this book has loved it and said it was great. The excerpts and stories from it I've read were great. The expectations were so high, I was afraid it would be another let down. But it wasn't. O'Brien's book is great (I've added it to my list of best books ever written). <br />The Things They Carried is a series of related short stories that create a novel. They all concern Alpha Company, which is the fictional O'Brien's company in Viet Nam. (Just to take a moment to clarify here, this book is in the fiction section of book stores, and O'Brien calls it a work of fiction rather than a memoir. I don't know how autiobiographical the stories are, but until I hear Tim O'Brien say otherwise, I'm assuming it is a work of fiction) At times the stories narritive flow is in such a way that they could be chapters of a novel, and at other times the individual stories are outside one another (the final story of the collection 'The Lives of the Dead' has the narrator telling us, after the war, about something that happened to him when he was a child of nine year. It doesn't fit with the others action wise, but thematically it is a nice capstone to the collection). Overall these stories fit together nicely. Most are told in first person. A few in third. A few are first person, but O'Brien is listening to another member of Alpha Company telling him about an incident that happened when O'Brien wasn't around. The stories patch together in an interesting, original, and highly effective way. The book was a finalist for the Pulitzer (beat by Updike's Rabbit at Rest) and the National Book Critics Circle Award, and won France's Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger (Best Foreign Novel) and the Chicago Tribune's Heartland Prize (I can't believe it didn't win the Pulitzer or National Book Award). The stories appeared in Esquire, Playboy, GQ, 'The Things They Carried' appeared in the Best American Short Stories 1987, and two stories appeared in the Prize Stories, The O Henry Award anthologies: \\"Speaking of Courage: (1978) and \\"The Ghost Soldiers\\" (1982).<br />All of the stories were great, but in a collection of great stories, two stuck out as phenomenal stories. \\"The Things They Carried\\" is the opening selection, and introduces us to the characters, Viet Nam, and O'Brien's talented writing and the great voice he uses to pull you into his fiction. \\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\\" is an almost surreal story of one a soldier who was able to smuggle his girlfriend into Viet Nam. It's a haunted story that shows how Viet Nam changed people. And it has a surprise and disturbing ending.<br />This is one of those truly great books, that only comes along once in a while. I've only read 30 or so books that I could place on par with this one (check out my 'Official Book Club' to see what else). This is a phenomenal piece of art.	2002-09-30
I will read this here or there...	... I will read this anywhere.<br />Now, the very thought of eating something like green eggs or green ham makes me nervous...food poisoning and all... But in Seussland green food doesn't mean food that has turned. <br />This is a classic children's tale (and the only children's book that has made my list of best books ever) that teaches children about keeping an open mind (and not just with food, this lesson extends to people and other activities). It's well written, and the rhyme and repition not only makes the book fun to read, but also helps in memorization (yes, your children will be able to recite it along with you). The drawings are typical for Seuss, fun and whimsy. <br />It's a great book for anyone at any age.	2002-09-30
great, but not all it's cracked up to be	This book has a huge cult following, as does Blade Runner (which was based on the book, in case for some reason you don't know this). But it didn't quite live up to what I expected it to be. Philip K. Dick is a great writer. And DADES is a great book, but I just didn't think that was all it was said to be. Perhaps his other books are the ones that hit you.	2002-09-24
burroughs disappoints	I found queer to be a dissapointment. I loved Junky, and it is one of my favorite books, but queer was a let down. It takes place after junky ends and we follow William Lee around with his fascination with Eugene Allerton and his trip to South America. But the story isn't that interesting. There is more of a plot here than there was in junky, but I found Lee's struggles with heroin much more fascinating than his obssession over the boring Allerton. queer is told from an outside narrator rather than from Lee's perspective, and as a result, the voice that helped make junky so great is missing. It just doesn't match with the standards Burroughs set when he wrote Junky. If you are a Beat scholar, then this is a book you should read (it is one of Burroughs important works) or if you study gay literature, then you should read this. If you're just looking for a good book, reread Junky...	2002-09-24
I'm going to go ahead and recommend it	The Razor's Edge came recommend to me from a source I trust. And while it hasn't made my list of greatest books written, it is a good book to read. It's tough to give a synopsis of the book, since like so many other British writers there isn't much of a plot, more of a portrait of a group within society. I guess you could say it is the story of Larry Darrell's search for God. But it only touches on spiritual matters. It doesn't go into the discussion we hope for. (If you're looking for a treatise on spirituality, read Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Kerouac's The Dharma Bums, and Anne Rice's Tale of the Body Theif) Maugham himself is a character and narrator of the book. He sort of reminds me of Nick in The Great Gatsby, but only a little. Maugham is a part of the action, but still separate from it. What this book reminds me of is a work by Jane Austen, but written better (I'm known for my dislike of Austen's work). I don't really get into Brit lit from the 18th and 19th centuries, but this book reminds me of that period. But written in such a way I found I enjoyed it. There isn't much linear structure to the novel. A lot of the action takes place in flashback, or in stories told in flashbacks. But Maugham keeps the reader from being confused. The book reads like a book. You know how some stories draw you in, to the point where you are a part of the story? The Razor's Edge isn't like that. You always feel like you are reading a book written by the narrator or that the narrator is telling you the story. There is a distance between the reader and the narrator and the narrator and the story. I think that is what holds the book back.	2002-09-24
this is why he is laureate	Billy Collins is the everyman's poet. Regardless of whether or not he'll be remembered a hundred years from now, and regardless of some people's opinion of the content of his verse, he is a good poet. He is one of the few who successfully use humor in his poems. His poems are easy to understand, but still have a literary backing to them. You don't have to have a doctorate in English to understand what he writes, but you can tell Collins is intelligent and well-read. You find yourself chuckling at some poems, and many times wishing you had come up with a phrase or an idea he uses. Read this collection (or his new and selected) and you'll understand why he has the popularity he does.	2002-09-18
some good, some bad	There is no doubt of Mezey's expertise in poetry. He has edited the definitive editions of both Thomas Hardy's and E.A. Robinson's work. And the man knows more about poetry than most people. But I found his own work to be uneven. The Collected Poems contains some good poetry, and as a whole it is an enjoyable read. But there were sections of the book that didn't seem up to par with the rest. I especially found the clerihews, couplets, and 'prose and cons' to be weak, and they invaded (a little) some of the other sections. Light verse is a joy to read, and a valuable form of poetry, but it seemed to me that Mezey didn't take them serious enough (no pun intended) to make them come off successful. But the first half of the collection I found to be really good. Mezey's Collected Poems is, overall, a good collection, and one worth reading.	2002-09-18
one of the best	There are two art forms that are American in origin: jazz and the short story. And when you think of the best short story writers, you think of Ernest Hemingway and John Cheever. Cheever has been called the Chekhov of the American short story. Cheever's stories deal with suburban life, but with a bit of surrealism in it. And this Pulitzer prize winning collection is a must have on any list. It contains two of the best short stories ever written, \\"The Swimmer\\" and \\"The Five-Forty-Eight.\\" Some of the other of Cheever's best are: \\"The Enormous Radio\\", \\"Torch Song\\", \\"The Cure\\", \\"The Sorrows of Gin\\", \\"O Youth and Beauty!\\", \\"The Housebreaker of Shady Hill\\", \\"The Worm in the Apple\\", \\"The Country Husband\\", \\"The Scarlet Moving Van\\", \\"The Music Teacher\\", \\"The Brigadier and Gold Widow\\", \\"Artemis, the Honest Well Digger\\". These short stories will show why Cheever is one of America's best.	2002-08-28
great book	Asma has created a great introduction to not only the historical Buddha, but also to his teachings. It's written in easily understandable language and he covers as much as he can, as throuroughly as he can, and in as small amout of space as he can. The illustrations do not distract, detract, nor make fun of Buddha. I highly recommend this book, not just to those interested in Buddhism or Buddha, but to anyone with an interest in philosophy, theology, or spirituality.	2002-08-22
good critical work, but a poor novel	Burgess' 1985 is really two works combined. The first is a series of essays and self-interviews that discuss Orwell's 1984. These are a great group of essays that really throw some light on Orwell's novel. Anyone who likes 1984 should read these essays. The second half is a novella of Burgess titled 1985. The dust jacket gives the impression that it is supposed to be a sequel of sorts. It isn't. It is a dystopia that takes place in 1985 (written in 1978) and is supposed to be a (more) possible scenario at the time. It isn't very entertaining, and a lot of ideas, characters, themes, etc aren't fleshed out the way they should be. But I suppose that could do with the shortness of the story. And Burgess should have been more careful with his title. Burgess's 1985 isn't a frightening or as well written as Orwell's 1984, and Burgess drawing the reader to make a comparison only hurts his story. After the novella is a short chapter on Worker's English (WE) which is Burgess' version of Newspeak. The problem is that WE isn't used much in the story, is really nothing more than a little slang, and I understand that Burgess only has the chapter/essay because of Orwell's explanation of Newspeak, but it is dull and unnecessary. Then Burgess finishes out the volume with another self-interview which discusses the possibility of his future. All this in only 270 pages. Still, the discussion of Orwell's 1984 that the first half is comprised of is excellent and the book is worth finding, if only for that.	2002-08-08
it set the standard	Orwell's 1984 wasn't the first utopia/dystopia written, but it pretty much set the standard for all those that followed, and even for those that came first. Orwell wrote a novel warning us of what could happen if political power went unchecked, and his warning was especially to his contemporaries living in the post-war England. Orwell does a brilliant job of capturing the despair and dinginess of life in his 1984. In fact he does it so well that if the reader is not careful the general mood of the novel could invavde the reader's life (it did mine). This book has been called one of the few masterpieces of modern literature. The third section especially so. Rarely have I read anything as great or powerful as part three of 1984. The dangers that Orwell warns us of leap forth in this section--the loss of free will and the total breaking of the human spirit, which we all would like to believe always survives. But it doesn't.	2002-08-05
a literary feast	A Moveable Feast is a short book that glances over Hemingway's years in Paris. I don't know that you could call this much of a memoir, it doesn't go into great detail, and just sort of skims over his years in Paris. It was definitely written by an older Hemingway, one who was full of himself and bitterness. The style of writing seems different. This isn't the Hemingway I know from his short stories. The narration seems almost child-like, and definitely not written as well as his short stories. But don't let me make you think I didn't enjoy this book. Hemingway is still the greatest and A Moveable Feast was a wonderful book to read, if only for his portrait of Scott Fitzgerald. And there is a lot more humor used here than in his short stories. This book didn't break into my list of favorites, but it came close.<br />(As a sidenote, if you enjoyed reading this, or want more like it, pick up Scott Berg's biography of Maxwell Perkins, _Max Perkins: Editor of Genius_, who was Hemingway's and Fitzgerald's editor at Scribner's.)	2002-08-05
ok reference book	First of all, I'm not having a child. I didn't buy this book to pick out baby names. As a writer, names are important, essential to the meaning of my work, so I knew I'd need to pick up a name dictionary eventually. It took me a while to figure out that I 'name dictionaries' are 'baby name books.' So I searched through the baby section at my local chain bookstore (which is nerveracking for a 25 year old single male with no children, no pregnant women, and no desire to have children) trying to pick one out. Most didn't quite give the information I was looking for. I only found two that filled my needs. This was the one I decided to go with. It's published recently (1998), covers many cultures, and has almost 700 pages of names. It's cross-referenced, gives a definition, some famous people with the name, variations on the name, origin of the name, and so on. I have found a few innacuracies, some major (Jubal, which means 'father of all' is said in this book to have an uncertain meaning possibly based on a musical instrument), some only minor. Still, it is a good reference for the general information needed. And I didn't find a better one when I was looking.	2002-08-03
great collection	Adrienne Rich describes Dorianne Laux's poetry as 'tough, sensual...with physical details that add up to more than their sum...' It's what I like about Laux's poetry, she is sensual, sexual at the same time a tough woman. Her poetry is much like Kim Addonizio's, who is one of my favorite contemporary poets. And they are friends, so it is no surprise that Addonizio has lead me to Laux. Dorianne's poems range from poems about the innocence of childhood to the raw, sexual poems that close the volume. Dorianne Laux writes the kind of poetry that I love to read. I highly recommend her work, especially if you are a fan of Millay, Addonizio, Kate Light, or April Lindner.	2002-08-03
Heinlein at his best	I've no doubt that Starship Troopers is Heinlein's best novel, but Stranger in a Strange Land is almost as good. And if you thought Heinlein had a lot to say in Starship, wait to you hear what all he has to say in Stranger. It's the story of a man, Valentine Michael Smith, who was born on Mars, grew up among the Martians, and then came back to Earth. This is the story of how he learns and what he does. And it is Heinlein's theological treatise. I found I liked parts 1 and 2 better, where Mike learns about humans and their culture. After that the book goes real heavy into the religion Smith creates. There it bogs down a little, feels a bit dated, and has the tendancy to be somewhat hypocritical of itself. But those are just a few minor flaws. This book is well-written, and one of my favorites.	2002-08-01
a modern classic	Pat Frank wrote a book that has stood as a masterpiece for fifty years, even though the cold war has ended and the book is a bit dated. What makes this such a powerful piece, and why, like all classics, it will last for all time, is the interactions and relationships of the characters, both with others and within themselves. The fact that Fort Repose was not destroyed in the nuclear war forced people to make a choice. Survive or give up. Who digs deep to become a leader? Where do all those silver spoons go? And will all the disaster, can you still be a moral man? Alas, Babylon has always been a quick read for me. Not because it is simple (it isn't) but because of the authors skill with narrative and characterization.	2002-07-27
A Great American Novel	When asked what the 'Great American Novel' is, nine times out of ten you'll hear either Twain's Huck Finn or Fitzgerald's Gatsby (one out of ten times you'll hear Kerouac's On the Road). And if this isn't _THE_ Great American Novel, then it comes close to being so. It's a simple story of a love triange. But it is so much more than that. Fitzgerald captures the period of The Jazz Age, and is considered to a certain degree, a social historian, by himself if no one else. What strikes me most about this book is the voice Fitzgerald uses to tell the story. There are a handful of narrators in American fiction whose voice stands out as so good, that it lifts the story above being merely good. Examples are Huck Finn, Holden Caufield, and Nick Carroway.	2002-07-27
Regardless of what they say, it's always gonna be a classic	There's always been all this arguement on whether or not Catcher in the Rye is a classic or not, whether or not it is great. I think that regardless of your opinion of the novel, you have to admit its importance to our culture, and just how many people it has touched. It's because Salinger works it on many different levels. When I read it first in my early teens, it touched that teen angst that we all seem to be filled with. But as I got older, and as I re-read the book, I begin to see that it isn't normal teenage feelings. As I age, I can understand the sadness, the despair, being lost like that. This is not just a book for young people. It transcends age (though you may be reading it in secret).<br />The other thing about this book that grabs you is the voice of the narrator. I've always felt that voice awas one of the most important aspects to any story. Those with an interesting voice, like Huck Finn or Nick Carroway or Holden Caufield, last forever. Regardless of your opinion of J.D. Salinger (and I'm no big fan of his), you have to admit, The Catcher in the Rye is a a great book.	2002-07-27
great man/great bio	Scott Berg has written a wonderful biography on one of the most important men in American literature, Max Perkins. Berg's book is well-written and very entertaining. It is more than a biography of Perkins, it is also a biography of Hemingway, Scott Fiztgerald, and Thomas Wolfe, and a portrait of America during the first half of the 20th century. This is one of those books that I could go on and on about. It is a book that everyone should read.	2002-07-18
not a great intro	The back cover of this books say: \\"If you are like most people, you're not sure what Postmodernism is. And if this were like most books on the subject, it probably wouldn't tell you.\\" I think this is like most books on the subject. You leave this book still unsure of what Postmodernism is. I suppose Postmodernism is too complex a subject to really get a grasp on in such a short format. The book takes a lot of different divergences, and in the end you know little more than what you started with. It is a good book to help you figure out what to read and look into for an explanation of Postmodernism. I'd say it is more of a guide as to where to go to learn about Postmodernism than an explanation of Postmodernism. It does get interesting at the end when it discusses Postmodern Artifacts (including cyberpunk, Madonna, and MTV). I'd say go ahead and pick it up. It won't teach you what Postmodernism is, but it'll give you an idea of where to go.	2002-07-18
a truly astounding poet	Thom Gunn is definitely one of my favorite poets, and this book collects his work up to _The Man with Night Sweats_, which is one of the better poetry collections there are. Gunn is a very uneven poet, and when he is bad, he is truly awful. But he has some of the best poems I've read. And this collection is a fun one to read, one best read slowly, over a long period of time, so that it can be savored. Gunn writes well in both free and formal verse, and he does interesting things with syllabics. He is one of the best poets we have.	2002-07-04
"Now all I love is under me, I think."	Rhina Espaillat is a wonderful formal poet. I highly recommend her last book, 'Where Horizons Go.' This latest collection is easily as good. Once again she shows her mastery of meter and form (and this one is also loaded with sonnets) and she has a graceful use of language. The subject material of this collection seems to be a bit more serious. <br />The best I can do for this book is to briefly look at my three favorite poems. \\"Retriever\\" is a dramatic monologue where the narrator is a dog. It's a touching poem about the love and devotion of dogs towards their people. The essence is in why dogs do this: \\"...Why/ do I serve him? Who else would recover/treasures hes always losing? \\" It's a touching and humorous poem. \\"Unto Each Thing\\" takes the topic of death, and life. Where a neighbors garden blooms more beautiful the spring their child died. We like to think that life and beauty in the face of death can help. But \\"too much, smell wearied, skin recoiled/from silk and velvet leaves to touch\\", and Rhina shows us it does not. The final stanza really sticks with you: <br />and mind ached with the gardeners back<BR>bent to the clacking of old shears<BR>over big, heavy-breasted blossoms<BR>gathering earthward like slow tears.<br />\\"Three Versions\\" is a poem where the narrator dreams her own death. It contains lines such as: \\"I settled in the mould, but begged them to/take word of me to those my death would wrong\\" and \\"I woke to the third days inhuman chill,/rank with the scent of mould. I smell it still.\\"<br />This collection spends a lot of time delving into death and other more serious concerns not seen as much in her earlier collections.	2002-07-02
good collection	In 1998 Tim Murphy's first collection, The Deed of Gift, was published. And it is a brilliant collection. This year Murphy's second collection, Very Far North, has arrived. Murphy still writes mostly short poems with short lines (dimeter and trimeter). And he does it well. He has a tremendous wit, and even more impressive is the seriousness and quality of his verse that you don't normally see in lines and poems this short. Murphy is a regional poet (much like our greatest regional poet, Robert Frost) who speaks of local and global concerns. This collection isn't quite as good as his first (which would be hard to top), and like the first collection it does get a little weaker towards the end, but this is a marvelous work and one I highly recommend.	2002-07-01
a disappointment	I recently discovered Nina Cassian, and I love her work. I've found her to be a wonderful poet. In her own language. Rather, translated from Romanian. I very happily sat down with this collection, ready to dive into poems that are beautiful, musical, and important pieces. What I found were trivial poems that tried to be playful and musical, but came across flat. They struck me as trite, and what is really sad is that I probably give the book more credit because of my respect for her and her earlier work. I say pick up _Life Sentence_ because that is the Nina Cassian we all know and love. (Oh, this collection does contain her translation of Jabberwocky into Romanian, but since I don't know how to pronounce the Romanian alphabet, it is just something to look at and not something you can really appreciate hearing. There is also her poem \\"Impreciation\\" in something called \\"English Spargan\\" which is her Jabberwockish made up language, and instead of being fresh and interesting, it seems rather embarassing. Maybe it comes across better in the origianl \\"Sparga Romana\\".)	2002-07-01
nice introduction	This book is a pretty good introduction to Mao and the history of modern China. It actually seems to focus more on the history of modern China than Mao. Unlike other volumes in this series, the graphics in this book do not make fun of their subject, but neither do they help to remember the subject any more than just the text does. Overall, I'd say if you have an interest in how China got to be the way it is today, than this book would be a good one to pick up.	2002-06-25
Heinlein's black sheep classic	Starship Troopers is one of those books that you have to read over and over to fully get everything that goes on in it. It's a thinking man's book that is as entertaining as any work of popular fiction. Troopers is really philosophical/social/political novel. Unlike the film version, there isn't much war in it. Mostly Heinlein waxing philosophical.	2002-06-22
a strong narrative collection	Wilmer Mills first book, \\"Light for the Orphans\\", is one of the first books in Story Line Press' new First Book Series. And it is a strong choice to start the series with. Mills is a sawmill operator in Tennessee, who is from Louisana, and grew up in a Presbyterian missionary in Brazil. The southern roots show in his work. The voice used in the poems is that of the south, the country. Almost every poem is a narrative poem or dramatic monologue. And almost every poem is a good one. This collection is full of interesting characters telling their stories. If you like narrative poetry, then there is no doubt you'll like this collection.	2002-06-19
Another stunning collection from Hecht	Hecht has to be one of the greatest living poets we have, and Flight Among the Tombs is another example of this. It is chiefly a sequence of poems where Death speaks as or through someone else. It is a powerful sequence of poems set with wood engravings Leonard Baskin. The combination is stunning. The section section of the book is a few poems added, I'm guessing, to make this a book-length collection. Luckily, with a poet of Hecht's caliber, the filler poems are just as good as the main portion of the book.	2002-06-16
a different kind of poet	A good sign that a poet is talented: Richard Wilbur writes the introduction to your first collection. Tim Murphy is different from the Formalist poets. Murphy has masted the short line--the dimeter or trimeter. Murphy's poems are metrically sound, without being sing-song. More often than not his rhymes are original and flow with the poem. And though the short line is often used for light verse, Murphy shows that it can be powerful when used seriously. Murphy's poems are the poems of the farmer (a highly educated and well-read farmer) and are easily accessible. The few poems that are of longer line length are also well done, showing that Murphy can write in pentameter as well. I didn't like the final section as much, titled \\"Early Poems\\" which I'm guessing he wrote in his youth. The poems are classical in nature and subject, their line lengths are longer, and though they are good, I think can see them as the poems he wrote while trying to find his voice. And I'm glad he did, because it is a strong voice. These poems are a joy to read, and I look forward to reading his new book. (My favorite poems: \\"The Peg-leg Pig\\", \\"Jasper Lake\\", \\"Lonesome Peak\\", \\"The Quarrel\\" and \\"A Dog Young and Old\\")	2002-06-16
This won the National Book Critics Circle Award?	This is just the type of book that wins these types of awards. Goldbarth's poems tend to be prosey and verbose. He has some good ideas behind the poems, and a few good lines. But that isn't what we read poetry for--ideas. Where are the images that can't be forgotten? Where is the play that language does so well? This is a poet like Jorie Graham, one who tries to say something, then gets bogged down with free association. There is some good stuff in the poems, but as a whole they are a let down. The opening poem, \\"Library\\" happens to be a poem where this works, but it is a list poem, and you can get a little wordy in those. The book runs a little long for a poetry collection (over 120 pages). Goldbarth could have used a good editor cull it some.	2002-06-16
proof that i don't like every book i read	The cover of Dick Davis' collection, Touchwood, is a dull brown with small image of tree rings. Rather boring cover, and for once the cover predicts the book. Touchwood is divided into three sections. The poems in Section one are generally dull. Davis switches between pretentious phrasings to what can only be described as prose written as verse. I found most of the rhymes to be predictable, forced, or just bad. Section two gets a little better. As an epigramist, Davis is pretty good. The short nature of the poem suits his style, and brings out a wit that the first section is completely void of. The bitterness that comes out in Davis writing is well suited for shorter poems, that and if the poem ends in only a few lines it doesn't have time to bore you. But towards the end of this section two the quick, witty epigrams we had been reading disappeared and the final four or five poems revert back to what was seen in the first part. Section three is a long narrative poem, \\"Esther,\\" which retells the story of Esther and Mordacai. Now, normally I like narratives. But in the longer poem (and this one goes on for 17 pages) Davis loses control of his story, rhyme, and interest. It's a book that had a lot of potential to be great, but fell short because Davis lost touch with what he is good at. Of note, Davis defines the word touchwood: 'decayed wood...used as tinder'. Fitting I think.	2002-06-15
ok to start with	I guess this is an okay book to start your Nietzsche education with. It does tend to gloss over or mock his philosophy at times, and there are quite a few illustrations that don't emphasize the point and that won't help you remember, that just seem to be there to fill space. But it does give the basics of his philosophy and the time he lived in. I wouldn't try to substitute this for reading the actual works written by him, but it can't hurt you. Nietzsche is tough reading, and this can only help.	2002-06-15
Beautiful work	Diane Thiel won Story Line's Nicholas Roerich Prize for a first book, which is a good sign when trying to decide whether or not to buy a book. I've found that the books that win this prize are generally good one. And Diane Thiel's book is a good one. She writes formal poetry with great attention to the rhythms and language of the poems. They are graceful poems and more often than not, the endings are stunning. And it's no wonder that her book won the award. If you look at the acknowledgments page, you'll see it runs a page and a half. It looks like just about every poem has been published in a journal, and several in award anthologies. <br />The book is divided into four sections. Section one, \\"Kinder-und Hausmarchen\\" deals with her father and her German heritage. It reminds the reader a little of Plath, but Thiel doesn't have the extremes that Plath thought she had. The poems are darker and hint at a rough childhood for the narrator. \\"He brought them with him--the minefields./He carried them underneath his good intentions./He gave them to us--in the volume of his anger [\\"The Minefield\\"] And one of the best poems in the book, \\"Love Letters,\\" is found her. It's a poem about a woman learning German to understand the language of her husband and children. And the coldness returned sums up what this section is about--a distant father.<br />Section 2, \\"Memento Mori\\" (which is a reminder of mortality, failures, or mistakes) contains the best poem in the collection, \\"Memento Mori in Middle School.\\" It's written in loosely rhymed terza rima and is about the narrator's oral (with visual aids) project in middle school. Thiel takes us through each of Dante's circles from both the child and the poet's understanding. This poem alone makes the collection worth buying. The rest of the poems in this section also deal with childhood.<br />Section 3, \\"Distance\\" is more loosely themed around adult love and loss. \\"South Beach Wedding\\" (about a couple strolling onto a movie set wedding)and \\"Bedside Readers\\" showcase Thiel's wit. <br />The final section, \\"The River Blued\\", seems a sort of catch-all for the left-over poems. There is no theme running through it, but there are some interesting poems. \\"History's Stories\\" is a twelve lined poem that echoes itself at the end of the line. And the echoed words create a phrase that sums the poem up. I forget the name of the form, but she does it well, and it doesn't seemed forced. She closes on the title poem, which seems fitting as the narrator walks through a hwaelweg (noted as 'whale-road, Old English kenning), and brings the whole collection into completion and touches on all themes in the book. <br />Echolocations is a well thought out, well written book. It's an impressive collection of poems, much less being a first book. It's a book I highly recommend, and one I think you will enjoy (especially if you enjoy the work of Kim Addonzio, Kate Light, April Lindner, Morri Creech, or Dana Gioia).	2002-06-14
An elegant first collection	Sonnets, villanelles, formal poetry of all types are found in Ehina Espaillat's first collection. Her poems aren't constricted or artificial, but come out with an elegance not often seen in poets today. Every poem in this collection is evidence that she loves language, poetry, and the challenge that comes in writing in rhyme and meter. The subjects of her poems range widely, though there does seem to be a high ratio of poems about poetry. There is also an interesting essay at the end of the collection that discusses growing up bilingual (Espaillat is from the Dominican Republic, and Spanish is her native tongue), which leads into a discussion of the beauty of language. Both the poems and the essay make this a book to treasure.	2002-06-14
it's one of those must have books	Frederick Morgan's latest book is one of those books that you should have. It's a beautifully made book, one you expect from a publisher of fine arts books like Arena rather than a small press like Story Line. It contains fifteen new poems of Frederick Morgan's coupled with fifteen photographs from his daughter Gaylen Morgan. Now, I usually get worried when I see poems and photos mixed. Nine times out of ten it doesn't work. This is the tenth time. Gaylen's photographs are beautiful images that mesh well with the elder Morgan's poetry. Neither relies on the other to say what it has to say, but they work well together. Both the poems and the photographs are haunting, beautiful, and well crafted. Pick this book up. you won't be disappointed.	2002-06-13
early review from the 'most hated man in poetry'	All the Rage is a collection of early reviews from William Logan, 'the most hated man in poetry.' Though with this collection it is tough to see why. Most of the reviews are fair and pretty accurate reviews. He doesn't get too rough on the poets, though you can see in some of the later reviews where his reputation as a tough reviewer begins. Over all most of the reviews were done in an uninteresting way, but then Logan himself admits that this is all the apprentice reviews that he wants to save. The collection starts off with an essay \\"The Prejudices of Aesthetics\\" which is interesting. The center essay is a poorly written essay on Auden (\\"Auden's Images\\"). One of the more interesting pieces of the collection is the interview with Logan at the end of the book. Otherwise there are reviews, some written poorly and others well written. As to his reputation as the most hated man in poetry, I'll have to read his later reviews to see where it comes from. This book is interesting as a history of William Logan, but nothing that demands to be on your shelf.	2002-06-13
The new standard	For years Norton has been the standard in the Literature textbook field. But lately it seems that Longman is coming up and taking over. First there are the pocket anthologies edited by R.S. Gwynn, better than anything Norton has. Then there is the Longman Anthology of Short Fiction edited by Dana Gioia and R.S. Gwynn, which should take the place of Norton as the standard that all other textbooks should be compared with. And finally there is the series of anthologies edited by X.J. Kennedy and Dana Gioia. <br />The Introduction to Fiction is an excellent anthology written by one of the best poets of this generation and one of the best poets of the older generation. Kennedy's years of experience in the literary world, and his years of experience writing for children (making things easy to understand), and Gioia's take on literature from outside the world of academia have given this anthology an ease of understanding that you won't find in anything Norton has put together. They write clearly. They have chosen good stories, and ones that help understand the topic of the chapter. As well as a `writer's perspective' which adds understanding to the story. They also have added two new casebooks on Raymond Carver and Flannery O'Connor. <br />I'd say that without any doubt Longman will overtake Norton with this anthology. In fact the only Fiction anthology that I find to be any better than this one is the Gioia & Gwynn Short Fiction anthology, also put out by Longman.	2002-06-13
more Gioia controversy	It seems that Dana Gioia can't do much of anything without turning the poetry world upsided down. More controversy, and all collected in this slim volume for us to take in. It starts with Gioia's essay \\"Fallen Western Star\\" which chronicles San Francisco's fall from it's height as the second largest literary center in the US. Like most of Gioia's essays, it is well-written, well-though out, and pertinant. It applies to more than just San Francisco, but discusses the danger we are in of losing all regional literature. And from there it was a hornet's nest had been poked. There are some well written discussions from Jack Foley (who edited the collection) and Richard Silberg (who opposes Gioia). Silberg makes a good case and writes almost as eloquently as Gioia does. I leave it up to the reader to decide which side is right. There are also well written responses from Dave Mason, Jonah Raskin, Micheal Lind, and Scott Timberg. There is also a letter from Howard Junker, which really doesn't belong here because it is a rant against Gioia, which is not thought out at all and clumsily written. The book is one that is essential to understanding the state of American literature. As usual, Gioia is in the center of some flurry of anger or controversy, but as usual Gioia makes a point that all of us need to understand to help save the state of American Letters.	2002-06-13
great book for children	William Blake (whose poetry this book mirrors) runs an inn where we meet angels, rabbits, tigers, a host of interesting characters. It's a great introduction to poetry for the youngest of children. The illustrations are quaint and fit this book perfectly. I can see why it has won the awards it has.	2002-06-11
tough to review	Shaw's latest collection is a tough one to review. While there are no poems that stand out as horrible, none really stand out as that great. The longish poem, \\"An Exhumation\\" is fairly interesting, but the rest of the poems fall short. He has an impressive list of places where his poems have been published, which might be the most memorable thing about the book.	2002-06-11
good narrative poetry found here	First of all, don't let the cover art fool you. This is not some sort of surrealist or postmodern collection. Paul Lake is a poet very much grounded in narrative and form. The book is divided into three sections. The first section is the weakest of the book. Lake has several good narrative poems throughout the collection ('Thorn' 'Inspectors'). Included in the first section is the narrative \\"Walking Backward\\" which is a great story told by a draft dodger or his draft dodging and of life's treatment of people. Section 2 only contains the long narrative poem \\"Seeing the Elephant\\" which is a great poem about a survivor of the Donner party. Section three, the strongest in the collection ends with one of the best poems, \\"Two Hitchhikers\\" which is not only a great ancedote, but has a hilarious ending. The collection has some very well done dramatic monologues, but where it weakens is in the lyric poems. \\"Pieces\\" and \\"Revised Standard Version\\" are pretty much the only lyric poems worthwhile. The rest bring down the collection as a whole. I wish that Lake had just included the narratives, a few of the dramatic monologues and those two lyrics. Perhaps to round the collection out more he could have included another narrative poem, which seems to be his strong suit.	2002-05-31
an american class system?	Though a bit dated, this is a wonderful book (i have the 1989 paperback edition, so i don't know if he has updated the book). I love the tongue-in-cheek humor that Fussell uses throughout the book. Especially dealing with the middle class. You'll find yourself laughing out loud. And the book is surprisingly relevant. You'd think that a 20 year old book about class in America wouldn't be relevant, but there is a lot to be taken from this book. Like I said, it is a bit dated, but any intelligent person (which most of you reading this book are) can make the changes. And after reading most of the book, and you can't seem to figure out which class you belong to, Fussell introduces, in the final chapter, the \\"X\\" people. Those that don't belong to any class, or create a category of their own. Yeah, not all \\"X\\" people fit all the criteria of Fussell's, but then part of being an \\"X\\" person is that individuality, and not necessarily filling every 'criteria.' This is a great book, if not for Fussell's social statement on America, at least for the humor he uses.	2002-05-31
great book of forms	Turco's Book of Forms has pretty much become the standard encyclopedia of poetic forms. And for good reason. But you shouldn't overlook Williams' Patterns of Poetry which is just as good, and in some way superior. It's well written and Williams chooses great example poems, and he divides the book seven sections, three appendices, and a glossary, which makes the book very accessible for the reader. While I would never say not to get Turco's book, I do think that you should also add Patterns of Poetry to your library.	2002-05-29
_THE_ manual of meter and versification	I would definitely not recommend this book to beginners. Don't get me wrong, it's probably the best book on prosody out there, but it can be difficult reading. The book is loaded with information, and Steele's knowledge on the subject comes through. But it isn't the book I'd start with. But if you have a general idea of form and meter, then there is no better book to strengthen and teach you. Part One, on iambic verse, should be read by any serious poet. The only problem I found with the book is that Steele uses a lot of Old English, Middle English, and foreign language examples, where I think something we all can sound out would have been a better choice. Still, for anyone who is serious about poetry, this is a book that should be read and studied.	2002-05-28
An 'American' Poet	Miller Williams has the distinction of being one of four poets to write a poem for a presidential inauguration (including Robert Frost, James Dickey, and Maya Angelou). But don't let Bill Clinton's opinion that Maya Angelou and Miller Williams are in the same class. They are not. Miller Williams is a far, far superior poet than Angelou. What strikes me most about Miller Williams is how 'American' a poet he is (he reminds me much of Carl Sandburg in this respect). Williams is one of the best loved poets of his generation, and for good reason. Of course he has poems that don't quite reach the potential he has, but the vast majority are good poems. I can think of no better way discuss Williams' poetry than by taking the eight best poems he has written. \\"The Caterpillar\\" is the best known and most anthologized of his poems. It's one of his earlier poems that discusses the endless circling of a caterpillar on a bowl, where it continued until it died. One would think it a poem in futility, but the final lines, \\"I think he thought he was going/in a straight line\\" sums it all up, not about futility, but about purpose and nature. \\"The Book\\" is a poem about joy changing to horror. \\"The Curator\\" is a touching poem about a Russian museum in WWII, where the paintings are taken down, in fear of bombing, and the curator describes what the painting are rather than the patrons viewing. It shows what are truly is, especially when the blind come to 'see' the paintings they never could before. \\"Thinking about Bill, Dead of AIDS\\" is a poem about love, even in the face of an unknown, deadly disease. How we love those close to us, even at our own risk and how we protect them, \\"not knowing anything yet,/we didn't know wha tlook would hurt you least.\\" \\"The Shrinking Lonesome Sestina\\" is one of the few good sestinas that exist among the thousands of sestinas out there (much like Elizabeth Bishop's and Dana Gioia's sestinas are worth reading). \\"Personals\\" is one of the funniest poems I've seen in a long time, and I will quote in full:<br />Like a challange? Male, 45<BR>could pass for 60, at least twice divorced,<BR>heavy smoker, sober now and then,<BR>living in trailer home with no water,<BR>looking for female with good job.<br />We may have no more need for half our doctors<BR>and every talk show will fold flat<BR>when we can understand why there are people<BR>who will enclose a picture and answer that.<br />\\"Ruby Tells All\\" is a beautiful poem about a strong woman, that you have to read to fully appreciate. And finally, a poem with one of the most interesting titles I've seen, \\"Why God Permits Evil: For Answer to This Question of Interest fo Many Write Bible Answers, Dept. E-7\\" followed by the epigram \\"ad on a matchbook cover\\". It's a great poem on God and life.<br />What I really like about Miller Williams is his subject matter, which ranges from the mundane to the profound and that he writes in both formal and free verse. He is a treasure to American poetry and one we should all read at some point. After reading his work, it is no wonder that he is as well liked and respected as he is.	2002-05-26
a great narrative series	In the many discussions of poetry that have been had, one question brought up by the novice is why do some poets write their stories in poems rather than fiction. The answer has always been to point to the classic epics or to the narrative poems of Frost, Robinson, and so on. I've recently found contemporary narratives that I can point to. Dave Mason's \\"The Country I Remember\\", the book-length narrative sequences by Marilyn Nelson, \\"The Homeplace\\", and Kim Addonizio, \\"Jimmy & Rita.\\" And now I have another to point to, Hudgins' \\"After the Lost War.\\"<br />It's a series of lyric poems, dramatic monologues, and shorter narrative poems that tell the story of poet/musician Sidney Lanier, who lived in the 19th century and fought in the Civil War. Hudgins tells the story through Lanier's point of view, in a voice Hudgins created for the narrator. The poems range from sad to loving to brutal. The poems come together to give us not only the story of Lanier, but a feel for the man and the times. It's a fine work of narrative poetry, one that I think will prove important to bringing the narrative poem back to the position it once held.	2002-05-19
a dark collection, but one you should definitely read	Dana Gioia has made a name for himself as both a poet and a critic. And I've heard both sides of the argument, but if you have read _The Gods of Winter_ than you cannot deny his excellence as a poet (and if you haven't read this collection, then you definitely should go and buy it now). The book is divided into five sections. Section I contains seven of his better poems. \\"All Souls'\\", \\"The Gods of Winter\\", and \\"Planting a Sequoia\\" are here. The poems in this first section are about loss, even \\"Planting a Sequoia\\" which is also about life. Section II contains the longer poem \\"Counting the Children.\\" The poems in Section III are poems more about place rather than the loss of sections I & II. Section IV is the long narrative, \\"The Homecoming.\\" It's a dark poem, Frost-like in its nature, about a troubled boy and what happens when he goes home to his family. The final poems, in Section V, while still dark, leave us with a bit more hope than found in any of the other sections. <br />Gioia's use of language and choice of words is exceptionally beautiful in this collection. And the heartbreak of losing a child if felt throughout. This collection leaves the reader a little sad, but with much to think about.	2002-05-19
a great narrative series	\\"Sometimes, like now, I have a great need<BR>To live outside metaphor,<BR>To know a dawn that's only dawn<BR>And corn that's corn and nothing else.\\"<br />In the many discussions of poetry that have been had, one question brought up by the novice is why do some poets write their stories in poems rather than fiction. The answer has always been to point to the classic epics or to the narrative poems of Frost, Robinson, and so on. I've recently found contemporary narratives that I can point to. Dave Mason's \\"The Country I Remember\\", the book-length narrative sequences by Marilyn Nelson, \\"The Homeplace\\", and Kim Addonizio, \\"Jimmy & Rita.\\" And now I have another to point to, Hudgins' \\"After the Lost War.\\"<br />It's a series of lyric poems, dramatic monologues, and shorter narrative poems that tell the story of poet/musician Sidney Lanier, who lived in the 19th century and fought in the Civil War. Hudgins tells the story through Lanier's point of view, in a voice Hudgins created for the narrator. The poems range from sad to loving to brutal. The poems come together to give us not only the story of Lanier, but a feel for the man and the times. It's a fine work of narrative poetry, one that I think will prove important to bringing the narrative poem back to the position it once held.	2002-05-19
'the hunger of skin for skin'	Lindner's first collection is a stunning first collection. She writes the kind of poetry that I really love, poetry that is sensuous, poetry that you can feel across the skin as you read it (her work reminds me very much of Kim Addonizio's and Kate Light's in this respect). In addition to the sensuality of her poetry, Lindner has a real feel for language and meter. Lindner's place in life as a woman, mother, and wife is very much felt in the subjects of her poems. And her word choice is astonishing. You get some great phrases in her poems(`the sky a blade/against my naked throat' -Midtown; `How smoothly the body seduces the mind.' -Condom). The middle section is a series of poems about Alma Mahler, told in a narrative sequence. This is a great first collection, and judging from the quality of these poems, I think we'll be hearing more of April Lindner in the future.	2002-05-19
Addonizio's fiction collection is good	Kim Addonizio is known for her poetry, which is raw in emotion, sensual, and sexual. This collection of 22 stories, her first collection, very much fits in her literary world. None of the stories are very long, in fact a few would be termed 'flash-fiction', but all are well-written and deal with sex to some degree or another, though none are graphic enough to call these stories pornographic. The stories that stick out the most are those that deal with troubled women and their self-destructiveness (which I suppose is just about every story). But before you assume that all is grim, there are stories (such as \\"A Brief History of Condoms\\") that successfully use humor. Might even make you laugh out loud. I am a huge fan of Addonizio's poetry, so it makes me happy to say that as a fiction writer she is pretty good. I look forward to reading more stories (and novels if she chooses to write them) from her.	2002-05-18
one of the best volumes of contemporary poetry	There is no doubt in my mind that Marilyn Nelson's poetry will be remembered for generations to come, and this collection, _The Homeplace_ (which was a finalist for the National Book Award), is the primary reason why. Nelson's poetry is good by any standards, but _The Homeplace_ stands head and shoulders above her work, which says quite a bit. I've read her new and selected poems. They were very good. The only complaint is that they weren't divided by volumes, so it wasn't until i picked up _The Homeplace_ and read it that I realized just how good the poems in this volume are. Because _The Homeplace_ isn't a collection of short poems, rather it is one long narrative poem. It's divided into two sections. Section I tells the story of her mother's side of the family, going back five generations to her great-great grandmother, Diverne. The story of this family goes through slavery, the turn of the century, wars, and up to the point where her mother and father meet. It's a heroic and touching story. Section II is the story of her father's time as WWII as a Tuskegee Airman. _The Homeplace_ contains everything good about poetry, and everything that poetry should be: story, form, meaning, love, and a wonderful use of language. This isn't a book you should pass over. It should be read--slowly and again and again.	2002-05-16
kennedy dark horses	X.J. Kennedy is of the old guard. Like Richard Wilbur and Anthony Hecht, the New Formalists have much respect for him. And for good reason, as this collection shows. Kennedy writes skillfully in meter and rhyme, and is one of the few poets who writes successfully in light verse (another poet who skillfully uses humor is R.S. Gwynn). Kennedy has also written children's books and textbooks, but this collection shows that his reputation as a poet will never wane.	2002-05-16
Steele's first two collections	Sapphics and Uncertainties contains Tim Steele's first two collections of Poetry, \\"Sapphics against Anger and Other Poems\\" and \\"Uncertainties and Rest.\\" It's a slim volume of intelligent poetry written in meter and form. This collection, much like the lates one \\"Color Wheel\\", shows why Steele is considered one of the best poets writing formal verse. Every line, every word is well thought out. Steele is one of the poets that should be on your shelf.	2002-05-14
Hudgins latest book	This is the first book by Hudgins that I've read. I've seen his poems in magazines, and those I've seen from Saints and Strangers I really loved. This collection isn't a let down. Hudgins has a definite style that he uses, that can sometimes be hard to understand, but more  often than not the poems are good and hit home.	2002-05-14
stunning story from addonizio	This series of poems by Addonizio is quite different from here other two collections, but it fits very well into her body of work. Jimmy & Rita is the story of two troubled people, how they met and what happened to them. I've heard it said that for poetry to succeed it has to take back the story from prose. Addonizio's poems definitely do that.	2002-05-11
2002 Pulitzer winner	Practical Gods wouldn't have been my choice for the Pulitzer, but I can see how it won. While there are no poems that stand out themselves, the work as a whole is impressive. Carl Dennis explores spirituality, religion, and gods (both Christian and non-Christian gods) in this collection. It's a pretty solid collection and I would recommend it.	2002-05-09
solid collection from a solid poet	Tim Steele has already proven his strength as a poet, and has quite a reputation for his work in meter. This collection only solidifies his reputation. The poems are well written (and Steele does some interesting things with meter and rhyme). Anyone interested in formal poetry should read his work.	2002-05-08
There's a reason this is a classic	This story is well written and very entertaining, and that's before you start diving into the meaning. the story isn't just about the russian revolution, communism, totarlianism, socialism, but shows us the dangers that can happen to anyone in any system of government if we are not watchful and beware those of the silver tongue. I recommend this book to everyone, for entertainment, and as a warning.	2002-05-06
one of the best	This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there.	2002-05-01
the ultimate anti-war novel	The words I used to describe Catch-22 are bleak, black, and absurd. Heller's brand of absurdist humor creates some of the most poignant moments in literature and some of the most hilarious (there are many, many laugh out loud places here). It is basically the story of Yossarian, a bomber, in the closing months of World War II. He can't understand why thousands of people he hasn't met yet are trying to kill him. And it goes from there. Loaded with absurdist humor. It does turn darker towards the end. This is a very densely packed book, every page loaded with information. It's not a book you can lose concentration while reading. But it is well worth the time and energy it takes to read it. Definitely one of the best books ever written.	2002-04-30
it gets better everytime i come back to it	Every time I reread this collection of short stories I find that I love it that much more. Hemingway's stories covered all range of topics, but mostly he deals with the human heart, in its relation to nature and with others. There is no need to talk about his style of writing because his 'tough, terse' style is legendary. I do wish that \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" were included here instead of by itself. I tried to pick my favorite Hemingway stories and I couldn't narrow it down to any less than 21.  \\"An African Story\\", \\"The Battler\\", \\"The Butterfly and the Tank\\", \\"Cat in the Rain\\", \\"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place\\", \\"Fathers and Sons\\", \\"Fifty Grand\\", \\"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\\", \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\", \\"Indian Camp\\", \\"The Killers\\", \\"The Last Good Country\\", \\"The Light of the World\\", \\"My Old Man\\", \\"One Trip Across\\", \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\", \\"The Snows of Kilamajaro\\", \\"Soldier's Home\\", \\"The Three-Day Blow\\", \\"A Train Trip\\", and \\"Up in Michigan\\".<br />There are few writers that I've found that can handle the short story as well as Hemingway. If you are interested check out the short fiction of Franz Kafka, John Cheever, Shirley Jackson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Mark Twain.	2002-04-20
great collection of essays	Jarman and McDowell came along with their magazine, The Reaper, when it was needed most. They've done a lot to bring back narrative poetry (McDowell is the founder of Story Line Press). They wrote these essays together, and weren't afraid to say what they thought--they weren't afraid to make anyone mad (they remind me of Randall Jarrell in that way). Meg Schoerke's introduction and the first Reaper essay introduce those of us who are unfamiliar with The Reaper. \\"Navigating the Flood\\" takes on criticism, and they aren't afraid to name names. Their essay on Wallace Stevens discusses his impact on contemporary poetry and the narrative. Two essays, \\"The Reaper's Non-negotionable Demands\\" and \\"The Elephant Man of Poetry\\" (which is about Robert Frost) are the two best essays in the book, and two of the best essays about poetry. They attack the state of poetry with satire and humor in \\"The Reaper Interviews Jean Doh and Sean Dough\\" and \\"The Dogtown Letters\\", and both essays will make you laugh out loud. The sad thing is that it just as easily could have been real. In addition to four other essays, there is also a guide to writing narrative poetry. This collection is so great that you wish that The Reaper was still in circulation, and you hope that one day Jarman and McDowell will collect a \\"Best of\\" and release it soon.	2002-04-17
It's not quite what it should be	I expected quite a bit from this book. Not only is it's title *Best* American Poetry, but the a quick glance at the contents shows these names: A.R. Ammons, Ashbery, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Bly, Creeley, Rita Dove, Thom Gunn, Donald Hall, Paul Hoover, Andrew Hudgins, Donald Justice, Koch, McDowell, Merrill, Pinsky, Charles Simic, Louis Simpson, Snodgrass, Gary Snyder and Richard Wilbur. It's an impressive line up of names. But this collection was a let down. Sure, there were some really good poems (such as the one by Elizabeth Bishop), and there were a lot of ok poems or other poems worth noting, but it isn't worthy of being called the best of any given year.	2002-04-13
I was surprised how good this was	I'm not the biggest fan of mystery stories, so I was unsure of how much I would like this collection. I was surprised at how much I liked it. There were a few that I didn't like that much, but most of them were good stories and most were well written. They ranged from ok to good, better, and on up to great stories like Shel Silverstein's story, Edward Lee's twisted story \\"ICU\\", and what i think was the best, Robert Girardi's \\"The Defenestration of Aba Sid\\", which is his 'anti-Grisham' story. A great deal of the selections here come from books and there is no surprise that both Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine both had three stories in here (the most from any one place). I suppose it's because there aren't many genre magazines anymore, but a few of these stories first appeared in literary magazines. The book is a little longer (around 480 pages) than those in The Best American Short Story series, but mystery stories need a little time to unfold. It's a good selection for the mystery reader (no matter which 'type' of mystery story you like) and for those of us who don't normally read the genre.	2002-04-10
McDowell's latest	McDowell's latest collection shows his skill as a story teller. There are both lyric verse and narratives in this collection, but the narratives are the true gems here.	2002-04-08
Great Narrative Poem	The Diviners is McDowell's book length poem about a family as it falls apart through five decades. It's a poignant story told in iambic pentameter, and is a prime example of the comeback the narrative poem has been making (as is Dave Mason's \\"The Country I Remember\\"). The first chapter, \\"The Fifties\\", is truly a great piece of work, and appeared in a slightly different form in the Best American Poetry 1989.	2002-04-08
Another winner by Doctorow	For those of you who read Ragtime and were a little disappointed, then World's Fair is the book you should read. World's Fair is a great portrait of the 30s through the perspective of a young boy. Where Ragtime failed by not putting together a good story, World's Fair is successful. Not Doctorow's best book, but definitely close to it.	2002-04-03
Inconsolable	This play seems to be an interesting essay doctorow wrote, and he put it in a play format to make it different. there isn't much action, so reading the play may be as effective as seeing it (though i don't know for sure). it has the danger of getting melodramatic. it fits well with The Book of Daniel. But beware of the ending of Act One. It's rather cheesy. Doctorow loses his subtlety there and really should rewrite it.	2002-03-31
It's a great story	This is Doctorow's first novel, and after reading it, you see from the very beginning he was a great writer. It's an ambitious treatment of evil, cowardice, love and family, wrapped up in an great western tale (of the spaghetti type). The Bad Man destroys the town and everyone in it in the first few pages. After that the human spirit thrives (sort of) as a few attempt to rebuild the town and their lives. And look for redemption.	2002-03-31
Doctorow's portrait of an era	It's tough to compare Ragtime with Doctorow's other works. There isn't much of a story here in the narrative sense, though 2/3 through the book one sort of happens with Coalhouse Walker. This book is more of a portrait of the times and of a slew of interesting characters, which include both real figures (J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, Houdini, etc) and imaginary. Doctorow dips into people's lives for a moment then moves on. One of the faults of the book is that many of the interesting vignettes aren't carried out to completion, rather he just moves on. At the center is an unnamed family (they go throughout the book called only Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, sometimes Younger Brother for short, Grandfather, and the son) that is somehow involved in everyone's life. It doesn't have the social/political importance that _The Book of Daniel_ has, nor the compelling story in _Billy Bathgate_ but it is still a great book to read.	2002-03-29
One of King's stronger works	It's been a while since King has put out a collection of short stories, and usually when he does they are more like short novels than short stories. I've said before that I feel King's strong points aren't in his short stories, that he needs a couple hundred pages, at least, to really get a good story going. But this collection of 14 stories was astonishingly good. Maybe even some of his best work. It starts with a short introduction in which King pretty much just defends his e-publishing and other \\"gimmicky\\" ventures. The first story, \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" is the standard `I'm not dead, though everyone thinks I am' story, almost straight out of Twilight Zone, with an interesting King twist on the end. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" is his O. Henry award winning story (first place), and yeah, it's a good story (though I think others in this collection are much better) about a child meeting the devil. Very Hawthorne-ish. Next is one of the best stories in this collection, \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away,\\" which I first read in The New Yorker. Not a typical King story, and proof that he can write outside his genre. And do it well. It's a story about a man who is unhappy with the choices he made in life and ready to kill himself. And King keeps the ending very ambiguous (which he does quite often in this collection), and that may be what really tops the story off. \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" is another story I first read in The New Yorker. This one reminds me somewhat of \\"The Body\\" in that it isn't horror and surprises you that Stephen King wrote it. It's a about John Dillinger. \\"In the Deathroom\\" is a story of torture in Central America (very good). \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" is the capstone of the collection. It is a story about the Gunslinger that takes place before any of the books and early in his quest for the Dark Tower. It deals with the Little Sisters that appeared in Black House and is a bit of a love story. By far the best in the collection. Next is \\"Everything's Eventual\\" that almost takes us back to Firestarter with it's secret government agencies. It's a story about self-esteem and moral choices made in life. \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is a wonderfully touching story with a horrorfying ending. The reality of this story makes it what might be one of King's most chilling pieces. The humor of the story doesn't prepare you for what comes at the end. Previously, King released this as an audiobook, and I think it might be interesting to hear him read it. \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" is a typical King short story. Nothing great about it, nothing spectacular, very mediocre. \\"Lunch at the Gotham Caf\\" is about a divorcing couple (that just happens to get put into a bad circumstance). It's entertaining. A little funny. And a good story. \\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French\\" is King's existentialist story about hell. One that you almost wish he hadn't wrote. Could be the worst in the collection. It's too repetitive, which I know was the point, but it doesn't carry well. \\"1408\\" is a ghost story of sorts. The haunted hotel story. It started off in a way that made me think I wouldn't like the story too much, and even though it never reached the level of the best stories here, it turned out to be a good read. \\"Riding the Bullet\\" is King's e-book. (And shows that a little patience pays off, for those of us who waited and didn't download the story) It's an excellent story about love, guilt, and choices wrapped in King's mean little world. I'm not sure if the point to the story was ever made, at least not the way he intended it, but this story makes you think about the choices you would make if you were in the same situation. At what point does your life become more or less valuable than your mother's? The final story is \\"Lucky Quarter\\" which is really a touching little story. No horror, just a lot of feel-good. This collection contains both of King's audiobooks (Blood & Smoke; L.T.'s Theory of Pets) his e-book (not The Plant, but then he never finished that for us), the story from his computer program F-13 and stories he's published elsewhere (everyone here has appeared somewhere else before). It's a solid collection. Every King fan will own it, and even those who aren't fans of King or his genre will find that at least half of the stories will be to their liking. This collection shows King's skill and maturity as a writer and should further add to the literary respect that is finally coming his way.	2002-03-27
this is what the best american series is all about	Edward Wilson guest edits the second in the Science and Nature Writing Series, and unlike many of the guest editors in the other Series (like the Best American Short Stories for this year), he does a phenomenal job, and shows us what this series is all about. The essays come from magazines who focus on the general reader rather than the scientist. The essays are informative. They teach the reader quite a bit and point out things that come to a surprise to most of us (such as the state of the earth's water supply). And they do it in an entertaining way. Above all else, the essays collected here are fun to read and not loaded with jargon the layman can't understand. A special note: Bill Joy's essay on technology and our future should be read at least twice and thought on long and hard.	2002-03-25
best of the year?	For 25 years Bill Henderson has been doing a noble thing with his Pushcart Prize Anthologies. Looking at the list of previous winners, you see quite an impressive list, and while not every writer of merit is represented, many are. I'm not familiar with the previous editions, but this year's selection seems a bit week. There are 40 poems, and like the entries in the 2001 Best American Poetry, they aren't the strongest choices. There are only three essays (one on apples--bad; one on Milton--great; and one by Seamus Heaney--ok), and you would think there would have been more in this selection. There are 24 pieces of fiction that range from the really bad to the pretty good. And then, a cross between the essay and fiction, there are 10 memoirs that also span the range. Looking at the contributing editors  you'd think Henderson's choices could have been stronger. But we take what we have.	2002-03-23
she's not bad	If you are a fan of Anne Rice or Clive Barker's work, then sooner or later you'll be led to Poppy Brite's work. She has the potential to become of one of the horror genre's great writers. This book dealt with two psychopathic murderers (Andrew and Jay) meeting and joining together. The book is told in rotating points-of-view, between first person Andrew, and the rest third person, Jay, Tran (a boy they set their sites on) and Luke (Tran's ex-boyfriend). I think the book suffers a little in this form. It's too short (less than 250 pages) and the action too fast to sustain rotating between that many points-of-view. The sex scenes can be a bit much at times. There are a few that are there only for gratuitous reasons and not to advance the story. I wish she had spent a little more time on story development than on showing us how good she is at writing homoerotic sex scenes (and why is it that women seem to be the best at writing sex scenes between two males?). But she has an interesting mind and can create some very good scenes and characters. I'll be interested in seeing how she further develops as a writer.	2002-03-18
excellent story	I've only read two of Doctorow's books, this one and _The Book of Daniel_, and this novel is about as far from daniel as you can get (though both are excellent). It's an excellent story about a boy coming of age in the 20s and 30s as a sort of member of Dutch Shultz's gang. He learns lifes lessons from these men. Doctorow's prose is lyrical, a sort of irony when you put the beautiful language Doctorow uses with the violence and moral ambiguity of the characters. This is a great culmination of Doctorow's work.	2002-03-17
powerful...phenomenal	This is the first book of Doctorow's I have read. Looking at his other books, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But it certainly wasn't this. Doctorow's work has the feel of Kerouac, Burroughs, Heinein's Starship Troopers, Kesey, and Kafka. He takes an incident from one of the most turbulent and trying times in our nation's history and spins a story of a young man trying to understand the life and death of his parents (executed for treason). Doctorow takes on religion, Disney, and the political and social attitudes of America. And he does it well. Daniel is a man who is both confused and very knowing. He's a radical but not like any you've seen before. Doctorow's style is a little disconcerting the first few pages (he jumps between first and third person, both from Daniel's point-of-view, sometimes in mid-sentence), but after you adjust to it, it seems the only way this story could be told. This is a book you have to read. I didn't put it on my list of \\"best ever\\", but it was definitely short-listed for it.	2002-03-15
a phenomenal poet	Li-Young Lee's latest collection once again shows what a phenomenal poet he is. While not quite as good as his first collection, _Rose_ (which is one of the better first books i've seen), it comes close. Lee has a lyricism and depth that continues to raise the bar for contemporary poets. The central theme of the mythic-hero father that was in Lee's first collection does not dominate this latest collection. Instead, we have poems that try to understand origins from both the father and the mother. _Book of My Nights_ is another poetry collection that deserves to be on your shelf.	2002-03-12
lee's second book is good	Lee's second collection of poems is different from his other collections. the poems are longer and centered around his personal history more than the other two. This collection isn't as strong as his first _Rose_ or latest _Book of My Nights_ but still is a strong collection.	2002-03-12
This is what prize winning stories are supposed to be	Unlike many volumes claiming to have the best short stories of the year, this one may actually be able to claim it. Of the 17 stories here, only three weren't very good (unfortunately the first prize my Mary Swan is one of those three). The rest were good, and there were three that stood out as phenomenal: T. Coraghessan Boyle's story of a young couple throwing their child away; Joyce Carol Oates's story of abduction, rape, and abuse; and David Schickler's story \\"The Smoker\\" which is so bizarre and so good that I will pick up his first collection of stories, which this one is included in. Most of the stories in this anthology are of a darker nature, but they are also very well written.	2002-03-12
lee is one of the contemporary greats	This is the first collection of one of contemporary poetry's great poets, Li-Young Lee. He does not disappoint. The poems have great images and a wonderful use of language. There are some beautiful passages in this collection. The rose is prominent throughout (and the long poem in the second section is about roses) both in the traditional meaning, but more in a different way to look at it. The other prominent figure is the father. The collection seems to be working through the myth, the reality of the hero-figure that is the father. Great work here that you can return to time and again and find something new.	2002-03-11
the o henrys are better than this	William Abrahams says in his introduction: \\"the twenty-three stories collected here are not offered as a further refining or pruining into a kond of 'best of the best'\\" and \\"it would not have been difficult to compile an alternative and equally impressive talbe of contents from among the 165 other O.Henry Award stores of the decade\\" and after reading the stories collected here, Abrahams is right. these stories are not the best of the best and it would have been easy to compile a better group of stories. Most of the twenty-three stories here are bad or mediocre, only eight of them were really good, and it isn't surprising to find out which eight. Joyce Carol Oates, \\"The Dead\\"; John Cheever \\"The Jewels of the Cabots\\"; James Alan McPherson, \\"The Faithful\\"; Raymond Carver \\"Are You a Doctor?\\" (though there are better Carver stories, this one seems to be a little ambiguous); Tim O'Brien, \\"Night March\\"; John Updike, \\"Separating\\"; Woody Allen, \\"The Kugelmass Episode\\"; and John Sayles \\"I-80 Nebraska, M.490-M.205\\", which was my favorite of the book. No, this wasn't a best of from the 70s, and I know the O. Henry Awards are better than this sampling.	2002-03-08
for X-fans only	i didn't check the science of the book to see how accurate it was or was not. i don't think that is really the purpose of the book. it's here for fans of the x-men to think on what gives them their powers. and it is mildly entertaining in its attempt. the writing bogs down here and there and gets a little boring but overall it is entertaining. there are a few xmen that are left out that would have been nice to read about (gambit, bishop, cannonball, toad, avalanche, mystique) and there are some that are questionable in their inclusion (scarlet witch, unus the untouchable). the technology and alien races section are extremely weak. the technology offers no diagrams and both sections are merely synopsises and don't go into the how. still, for an x-fan, it is worth reading.	2002-03-08
great portrait of cassady and kerouac	As great as the Beat fiction is, and life-changing as On the Road is, we get too caught up with the fictitive personas of the Beats. It's nice to see the side of Kerouac, Cassady, and Ginsberg that didn't make it into the novels. I'm sure Carolyn's viewpoint is skewed a little, but so is what we read in On the Road. Between her work and their work we can get a picture of what they were like, not as legends, but as men. <br />There are times when Carolyn bogs down with too much detail, or too much whining, or patches that just aren't great writing, but all in all it is a good biography, autobiography, and novel.<br />If you want to know more, here is a good place to start, along with these books, though you probably have read them by now: Kerouac's On the Road and The Dharma Bums; Cassady's The First Third; Perry and Babb's On the Bus; Ginsberg's Howl	2002-03-02
a wonderful collection	after reading lorrie moore's debut collection you don't wonder where her reputation comes from, you know. moore's stories are about love and loss. she uses a very interesting voice in this collection and parodies the self-help books that were over-abundant in the 80s. and she is very successful in her efforts. this collection shows why moore is considered one of the modern masters of the short story.	2002-03-02
weak collection	the poems in this collection range from merely mediocre to bad. the major theme is being indian and the wrongs done. but if you are familiar with alexie's worth than that won't surprise you. and his sister's death by fire makes an appearance in several poems. the problem is alexie never says anything new in this book. you could pick any five poems at random and that's all you need. the other poems say the same thing. there is one bright spot, the first section of his poem \\"Inside Dachau\\", but it completely falls apart after that first section. i hope that one day alexie will select his best 10 poems and the best of his short stories and put out a selected poems and prose, that way instead of having so many mediocre books, maybe we can get one book that is really good.	2002-03-02
99 was a good year	Doctorow has excellent taste in short fiction. With only a few exceptions (Junot Diaz and Marilyn Krysl), the stories in this collection are excellent. Amy Bloom's story, \\"The Story\\", which i think is a great title, is an interesting story about writing, about the characters in the story, and it is a story about itself.Michael Byers has a great story about obsession and attraction rather than love (though he does go on a page or two too long). Ron Carlson has a wonderful story about about happiness and the ways you can get there. It is one of the best of these stories. There is a story from Raymond Carver, and it is as good as anything he has written. Kiana Davenport's story deals with abuse and family. Everett's \\"The Fix\\"  is the best story in this anthology, which it's allusion to Christ, in a sort of Kafka-like way. Gautreaux's story about atonement is a winner as always. I remember reading Gurganus' story, \\"He's at the Office\\" when it was first published in the new yorker, and i remember thinking at the time that it had to be one of the better stories i'd read that year, so it was a pleasure to see doctorow select it. Aleksandar Hemon and Jhumpa Lahiri both have well told stories about being a foreigner in this country, though one has an uplifting feel and the other is more bleak, but both are a pleasure to read. Annie Proulx's \\"People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water\\" is a story you should read. but don't let the title fool you, it doesn't fit the story. Sherwood's story about loss is weak and a better selection could have been made, but it wasn't dull like the two mentioned earlier. i could go on about the stories i haven't mentioned, but there is a space constraint. i've only read best american short stories 2000 and 2001, so i can't say if these selected are better or worse than what is normally picked, but i can say that there are 18 stories here that are fine examples of what a short story should be.	2002-03-02
a sorry disappointment	When i looked at the table of contents, i saw a pretty impressive list of poets and quite a few surprises. then i read hass's essay, which was great. the problem is hass's taste in poetry. very few of the poems in here should have even been considered for this volume. even from poes who have proved time and again that they are good poets have bad poems in here. beside hass's introduction, the only redeeming part of the book is the contributor's notes and comments.	2002-02-21
classic	This is another of Kafka's masterpieces that everyone should read at some time. It's a fascinating book, that has too much going on in it to be able to discuss in the short space here. it will make you think.	2002-02-21
a good first collection	alexie's first collection is a pretty good one. the stories are generally short and all are interrelated. it's the strongest work he's done, and likely always will be.	2002-02-20
she's not so great	while her poetry isn't the worst i've read, graham's isn't that great... her poems drag on, all could be cut by about half or even a third. she seems to forget just what the english language can do in the hands of a master, because her poems are flat and i've heard of people talking about her work being difficult. i think they confuse difficult with nothing to say.	2002-02-19
not the best the year had to offer	i don't know that i would call these the best the year had to offer. there are a few that are bad, most are good, and a few that definitely were the best of 2000 (Marisa Silver, Ha Jin, Peter Orner, Roy Parvin). you can argue over whether or not this is the best of the year or not, but you can't argue that it is a good collection of fiction.	2002-02-16
doesn't disappoint	This is my first time to pick up the best american essays series, and i wasn't disapointed. there were a few essays that i struggled to finish (i remember skipping them when they were first published in their respective magazines), but there are many strong essays in the collection: Anne Fadiman's essay \\"Mail\\", which warns of the dangers of email; Heiman's touching \\"Vin Laforge\\"; Stephen King's essay \\"On Impact\\" is not surprisingly the best of the bunch; Yusef Komnkyaka has a very interesting piece in here; Marcus Laffey, the anonymous new  york policeman's insightful piece, \\"The Midnight Tour\\" is included; rebecca mcclanah's essay closely follows king's as the best included; Reynolds Price's \\"Dear Harper\\" is one of the finest spiritual pieces i've seen in a long time; and Carlo Rotella has a great essay on boxing. there are a few that shouldn't have been included and a few that are iffy, but that is more personal opinion than the quality of the essay. it's a good sampling of the year.	2002-02-16
Ethereal	strand's poetry has a surrealistic, ethereal feel to it. while you won't find many great poems here (but do read \\"The Tunnel\\"), you will find a lot of interesting, solid poems that make it a worthy collection to read.	2002-02-13
phenomenal	jarrell shows everything that is wrong with criticism today. the intelligence, wit, good writing, and fearlessness that is found in his criticism is missed in the critics of today. jarrell writes on everything, poetry, prose, art, music, and even cars. and he does it well.<br />i've only seen one other critic with this skill, and i believe he has a collection of his essays/reviews coming out soon: R.S. Gwynn	2002-01-30
not his best work	the latest collection of poetry from seamus heaney isn't his best work. in fact, if you aren't familiar with his work you'd do better starting with opened ground. there is a pensive tone throughout the collection, and the entire second half is written for recently dead poets. when you read this you can see why he won the nobel, but i'd wait to read this after you've gone through his selected poems. and here are some other poets you may enjoy: dylan thomas, yeats, robert frost, r.s. gwynn, david mason	2002-01-25
quick collection of sonnets	this isn't an exhaustive collection of sonnets, nor a serious study. it is simply what it is: a short collection of sonnets that can be purchased cheaply. there are many great sonnets not included and no contemporary sonnets. but it isn't meant to be anything more than what it is. and if you love the sonnet, it's a good collection.	2002-01-22
the far side is by far the funniest comic strip	i can't tell you whether or not to buy this collection, you either like gary larson's work or you don't. and if you know his work, and everyone does, you already know if you want this. it's a winner. and has a brief intro by stephen king--it comes to no surprise that king is a fan of the far side. they seem to fit together.	2002-01-20
little too much	as prolific a writer as louis l'amour was, there are all kinds of great quotes, but with as many books and stories as the man has, they can be tough to look up. so it's great that his daughter compiled this collection. i had to only give it four stars for 2 reasons: 1-you'll find no quotes from his single poetry collection or from interviews; 2-when you write as much as l'amour did, you are going to end up repeating yourself. that's understandable, but when editing a collection of quotes, you can leave out quotes that simply say the same thing in just about the same words.	2002-01-20
kind of a mixed bag	this collection of stories contains some gems and some that are pretty bad. it's tough to judge sherman alexie on this collection. &quot;Assimilation&quot; is a story that had a lot of potential until it started to become choppy and just ended. &quot;toughest indian in the world&quot; was a good story until the end, when it took a homosexual twist for no purpose at all. and in the closing words of the story alexie seemed to be trying to say something, just not anything the reader will pick up. &quot;south by southwest&quot; made some sort of attempt at being profound gay fiction but failed almost as miserably as the plot. &quot;the sin eaters&quot; is by far the best piece in the collection. it's what kafka would have written if he were indian. this story is a rarity in the collection, it starts off well and doesn't fizzle out. &quot;saint junior&quot; is a sweet story about love that just isn't interesting. &quot;dear john wayne&quot;...it's tough to figure out just what alexie was trying to do here. &quot;one good man&quot; is another sweet story about the love between a father and son, that, like &quot;saint junior&quot; just isn't interesting, though the candy hunt passage was good. i can't say not to purchase this collection, because you should read &quot;the sin eaters&quot; but maybe you should borrow it if you know someone who has a copy.	2002-01-17
worth the hunt	Gwynn's first collection is out of print, so you'll have to search around to find a copy of it, but it is worth it. If you are familiar with Gwynn's work then you already know he is a master satirist and has mastered form, meter, and humor. (If you're not familiar with his work, then make sure you get his new and selected poems, _No Word of Farewell_). There are only a dozen or so poems that he didn't select for the new and selected poems. But you should read them, and not only them, but the selected poems in their original order. It makes interesting reading.	2002-01-16
like life	this small collection of stories are enjoyable and well worth reading. i've heard a lot of good things about moore, and this collection shows me that she may be as good a i've heard. the stories are well written, but they don't grab you the way you expect. still, a solid collection.	2002-01-13
Great Introduction to Poetry	I can't go on enough about how great a poetry manual this is. It's not stuffy, and it is fun to read. Especially chapters 7 and 8, which are on sound in the English language. And they should be read out loud. Also pay special attention to chapter 13 which discusses making sense in poetry. The examples and exercises are helpful. This is the best poetry introduction I've seen. The anthology carries Mason's flair, but you could supplement this manual with R.S. Gwynn's Longman anthology.	2002-01-13
30 years from John Wood	wood's selected poems is a solid collection of poems spanning 30 years. there are a wide variety of themes and styles contained in the collection, though man's relationship with a higher power seems to be the prevailing theme. but don't get me wrong, these are not necessarily devotional poems. you have to read them to see what i mean. pay special attention to &quot;Opie and the Apples,&quot; &quot;Baptisms,&quot; &quot;Silage,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Here in Louisiana.&quot;	2002-01-05
this is just great	this was just great. for those of us who couldn't be there for perry lane, the bus trip, or the acid tests, this is a great account of the time. you don't realize how important kesey was to the movement until you read this. on the bus is really a quick bio of kesey. it helps you to understand how kesey took over where kerouac left off. you really feel as if you know kesey and neal after finishing this book. if you are a bohemian, beat, hippie, or any combination, then this is the book to get.	2001-12-31
expected better	we don't get to see as much of wendy cope in the u.s. as i had hoped, so i ordered a couple of her books from amazon uk. the few poems i had come across of wendy cope's have been great poems. her touch of humor is excellent in those poems. but the poems in this collection are less than stellar. much of the time the rhymes are predictable and uninteresting. her repetition of styles and themes gets old (god knows she must love the villanelle). in this collection her nursery rhyme imitations are phenomena. i can just see wordsworth and eliot writing those. her strength seems to be in mimicry, which she didn't do much of here. i don't know, maybe the poems i like so much came from serious concerns. if you want to read someone who is a better formal poet, and has what is probably the greatest wit of any living poet, check out R.S. Gwynn's selected poems: No Word of Farewell. it's well worth it.	2001-12-29
not quite as good as the body	this collection of photos isn't quite as good as his selection for the body. but there are many good photographs in it. the text of the chapters is well written and informative. some of the placement of the photos is confusing. all in all, a good book to have.	2001-12-22
a good regional writer	christopher cook is a pretty good regional writer. he writes the local excellent, and the dialogue is pretty close, and the people, the people are vintage east texans. and i know, i live in southeast texas. there's nothing wrong with being a regional writer, it's just that i don't think those outside of this area are going to be interested. the stories are only ok. at times he seems to be celebrating religion and at times satirizing it. cook is trying to make a statement, you can tell by the way he closes his stories, but he just doesn't quite get there. i felt 'lawbreakers in bethlehem' was the best story in the collection, followed by 'screen door jesus' an excellent satire of east texas fundamentalism.  'arc of flesh, ascending' 'the serpent' and 'a tinkling cymbal' fall far short of quality storytelling. the shift to first person narrative in the final story is a bit abrupt, doesn't close the sequence the way it should. all in all, cook has a lot of potential as a texas writer. i'll keep watching what he produces to see where he goes from here.	2001-12-19
the king of pop culture and the use of straub	have you ever noticed how much pop culture references king can pack into a book? luckily we have straub to hold him back a little. <br />it's supposed to be a sequal to the talisman, but the two aren't really connected. you get to meet some new great characters and some new annoying one. the most irritating is the narrator, who is an entitiy in this book. the whole first section, some hundred plus pages, is a waste of paper. it would be a great (though endless) camera shot. but this isn't a movie. it's a book. the end is a bit of a letdown. i hate it when an author creates miracles just to save the good guys and take care of the bad guys. but the middle is entertaining. we should just really wait for king to finish his dark tower series (i do wonder how straub feels at being used as a device for king's dark tower series). really, was there a point to straub here at all?	2001-12-13
well, he's clever	i hate to be the voice of dissension, but i wasn't quite as taken by williamson's work as others are. it's nice to see humor used in poetry, but williamson has a tendency to beat the joke to death. half the time i wished he had cut the poem in half. take &quot;origami&quot; for example. he went on with a list for about 30 lines. by the time i got to the end, all i could think about was how glad i was it was over. it's stopped being amusing long ago. and he does this in several other poems. and many times i got the feeling he was being clever for the sake of being clever. i say kudos. you're clever. but that's the first and third section. the middle section, double exposures, is brilliant. it's what makes this book worthwhile. it's the reason i gave him such a high rating. this form that, if i'm not mistaken, he created is one that has to be pretty difficult. writing two poems that mesh together well enough to create a third poem is a level of skill that few poets will ever reach. and most of the double exposures are phenomenal. there are a few that don't work quite as well, but they still work. this is a book to get because of the double exposures. they are a delight to read.	2001-12-01
great novella	oates writes a really good short novel about a girl whose life turns her into something both chilling and sympathetic. oates has a bit of an experimental style with her massive sentences and some odd structures late in the story. it's definitely not your regular book.	2001-11-28
good for the sandburg scholar	this is a good collection for the fan of sandburg or the scholar. i wouldn't chose this as your first introduction to sandburg (you'd be much, much better off with the selected poems). the poems are not his best, but they are good for those of us who are already sandburg fans.	2001-11-24
a truly wonderful collection	if i had to describe Anthony Hecht in one word, it would be regal. there is no poet who looks more dignified or acts with more dignity. and his poetry is full of grace, dignity, and a quiet power. it is no wonder that hecht is as respected as he is. the poems in this collection are ones to be read slowly, over time, in order to fully digest what makes hecht such a magnificant poet.	2001-11-22
one of our great poets	how do you discuss 23 years, the last half of a great poet's long career, in such a short allotment of space. you really can't. i will say that some of his better works is in the first volume. that isn't much more i can say than pick up his collected works.	2001-11-22
a weak collection	i know gunn is a good poet, i've read many poems he has written that i like. but this collection is weaker than gunn's usual work. the book does get stronger as it goes on, making section three the strongest of the three sections.	2001-11-21
a good use of humor	i wasn't exactly sure what to expect from collins. the man seems to inspire people to be either rabid supporters or rabid haters of his work. his selected poems is a strong selection from his work and some good new poems. after reading this collection, i can tell you his work is good. he'll never be considered one of the most important poets, and not all of his poems are strong. but he has a great use of humor, and there are several times i found myself laughing out loud. collins is definitely a poet worth reading.	2001-11-15
awesome first book	i have to rate this book with addonizio's _The Philosopher's Club_ and Kate Light's _Laws of Falling Bodies_ as my favorite first books. It's a powerful work. Most of the poems are religious/spiritual, which Creech handles with a skill you don't see anymore. even if you're like me and don't particularly enjoy religious poems, you'll like these. i wish i had more space here to go more in depth, but you have to get this book.	2001-11-15
great anthology	It's a little tough to give this anthology a review. let's be honest, when you have about 2,000 pages to work with, you get a lot of good stuff. there are so many great poems in here i had to give it the full five stars. but there are a lot of obscure poets in here. there are some poets i felt that should have been included that aren't, as well as some poems. still, if you are a beginner in poetry or a more advanced reader, it's a good anthology. if the price and heft scare you, then check out r.s. gwynn's longman pocket anthology, which is a smaller, cheaper, tighter anthology.	2001-11-01
not the greatest dead russian	the language of the stories is a little stilted, but it is tough to tell if that is gogol's fault or that of his translator (it is definitely time for a new translation). the stories range in all types and quality, though gogol is at his best when leaning towards the fantastique (kafkaesque comes mind). there are some good stories in the collection: diary of a madman (the only story that is genious), the portrait (gogol ruins what would have been his greatest story with a poorly written, unneccesary second half), the nose, the overcoat, and taras bulba (though a bit wordy and does carry on a little too long). vol 2 is by superior volume (if the editor's introduction and diary of a madman had been in it, there would be no point to volume one).	2001-10-18
move on, move on	pound seems to go out of his way to sound academic and to make as little sense as he can (it's almost as if he's writing in sound bytes). this book is a sad disappointment from a man who really contributed a lot the the world of literature. i say pass on this one.	2001-10-17
read this right here and now	this book was a pleasure when i first read it so many years ago, and upon my re-reading, i found it still to be a wonderful book. it has one of the best characters king has created (or co-created), which is wolf. it combination of horror and fantasy that any fan of king's will recognize and enjoy. (sorry to say i really haven't read any of straub's work, so i can't really compare to the rest of his work) and let's be honest, anyone who enjoys king's dark tower series definitely wants to read this book--the similarities are obvious. it does bog down a little at the end, and they do use the talisman as a convenient plot piece to get jack and richard out of trouble, but the rest of the book overpowers the weak ending.	2001-09-30
good collection	nelson's collection as a whole is pretty good, though it does drop off a bit in the hermitage section. her poems are poems of home and family and spirituality. it's a good selection of her work.	2001-09-21
not a good collection	to be fair, i never really expected much out of giovanni, i just grabbed this book from the library on a whim. if you want to read a poet who write political poems or poems on race, then grab marilyn nelson, gwendolyn brooks, sapphire or ai, and see how it should be done.	2001-09-21
jimmy's poems	while the poems are not horrible, there really isn't much that is spectacular about carter's poems. they are regional poems told in a simple voice, you can almost hear carter's voice. still, i think he needs more time to work on his poetic skill. the illustrations were nice, i think that carter's granddaughter has a future in illustrating children's books.	2001-09-19
not her best work	having read rita dove's selected poems, i know she has written good poems (the adolescence poems, in the old neighborhood, the thomas and beuleh poems), but these poems don't have the same quality of her previous works. the poems in this collection don't have the narrative quality that made thomas and beuleh so good. the cameo sequence of poems is simply a poet trying to be difficult or experimental but not succeeding. the political preachiness wears on the reader after a while.	2001-09-16
one of the greats	Browning is one of the great poets. this selection contains poems such as 'the last dutchess', 'porphyria's lover' and 'childe roland to the dark tower came' which shows browning at his best. this selected poems only whetted my appetite for a complete version.	2001-09-16
strong first collection	Winner of the 1999 Hollis Summers Poetry Prize and 2001 Norma Farber First Book Award, Pelizzon's first collection is one of the stronger first collections i've seen. if she can keep up this quality of work she'll seen be a force in the poetry community.	2001-09-08
the man is really good	it's no wonder wilbur was once the poet laureate or that this collection won the pulitzer, the man is good. he uses the language beautifully (the way english was meant to be in poetry), he has tight control of the rhyme, meter, subject, and words in his poems. where he really shines is in his translations. wilbur is one of the best translators living today.	2001-09-07
the famed beat poet fails to deliver	THE Beat Poet fails to deliver once again. i seriously don't know where this man's fame comes from. it isn't his poetry (with the exception of Howl and a few other poems). there really isn't much to say about ginsberg's work other than it is bad. maybe if he had spent a little time in revision he could have done better. you're best off with his selected or collected poems.	2001-09-07
allen's daddy	Louis Ginsberg is the father of the famed Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg. and their poetries couldn't be more different. Louis is a lyric poet who wrote in rhyme and meter. there were some political poems in the collection, but not nearly as much as you find in allen's work. the poems aren't bad, they read like student poems, some successful, many not so much. There is an essay by allen starting the book. what should have been a highlight is a big dissapointment. allen spends little time talking about his father and more time trying to discuss the meter of the poems, and it becomes obvious that allen knows little about meter. there are a couple of good poems in the collection, but over all it isn't worth the effort of finding the book, unless you are a ginsberg scholar.	2001-08-31
a failed attempt	i know bakker is an authority on dinosaurs, and i'm sure his nonfiction books are excellent to read, but he is not a fiction writer. and it shows in this book. i know what he wanted to do, but he should have left that job up to those who make a living writing. the text jumps between a narrative account and a documentary. the language falls flat, and without human characters, bakker is unable to make raptor red interesting. it's a nice try, but instead of this book, pick up one of bakker's nonfiction pieces and one of crichton's novels.	2001-08-30
not so good	knowing the quality or writers that the new yorker supported for many years, i had high expectations for white's work. it was a dissapointment. the poems were flat and fell short, and try as he did, he could not create the humor found in dorothy parker's poems. the sketches, for the most part, were meant to be humourous, but were not. there were a few good ones in the final section of the book, but if you want to read the finest that the new yorker produced, read john cheever's and dorothy parker's work.	2001-08-27
revisiting derry	one thing you know when you pick up a stephen king novel is that you are most likely going to get a good story. as you do here. and with 600 pages you can figure king is going to give you plenty of lead-up time before it really gets going. but that isn't the case here. king immediately leaps into the story. the first part of the book moves at a blinding pace, one you usually don't see until the end. unfortunately he slows down during the middle section before finally speeding up again. locating the story in derry, king runs the risk of resurrecting pennywise, but don't fear, he doesn't (though the story does remind one of _It_ and _Tommyknocker_. i would have given it a higher rating except for two problems: 1) the ending is too neat. after investing 600 pages worth of reading time, king cops out in the end and makes everything end far too neatly. 2) i've noticed in king's later fiction he has a tendency of giving away the action before it happens. he mentions that something has happened or will happen, then in the next chapter he writes it happening. gives too much away. not his best work, but by no means his worst.	2001-08-27
false advertisement	the premise of this book is great, what would have happened if certain events in history had turned out differently. the problem is that most of the contributors didn't read their assignment correctly. there are pages of what happened, and then a few paragraphs of how it could have turned out differently, and then a few sentences on what the world would be like if it had happened another way (sometimes not even that). it's an ok book for information on certain events in history (though there are far better books that are more detailed and better written on each time period). I'd have to say Stephen Sears' essay on the civil war was the best of the bunch (even ambrose was a let down). this book is not what it says it is.	2001-08-27
middle of the road	nabokov, while being a superb writer of fiction, isn't the best poet there is. i'm not saying the poems in this collection were bad, just nothing spectacular. (the chess problems on the other hand were a joke, way too easy)<br />which is a shame because, like many other fiction writers, he found great dissapointment in the world not viewing him as a poet. but, once again, it's because he didn't produce that many stellar poems. it was interesting to see a well-known translator translate his own work. it has to bring something new to the world of translation. i wonder if it has any special problems...	2001-08-22
a little slow for wilson	Charles Wilson's book, Donor, is a bit of a disapointment from what I expect from the author. The story moves at a much slower pace than most of wilson's books. And while it does pick up its pace after the first 100 pages, it never quite reaches what wilson usually writes. The plot is almost paint by the numbers. Wilson usually gives a few good twists and turns in his books, but not so much here. And one of my favorite aspects of his writing is the interesting characters he creates. But in this book none of the characters are that interesting, except for howard and blue, but wilson never really goes inside them. If you are a fan of charles wilson, then I'd say definitely pick up this book, but if you haven't read anything by him, you'd be much better off starting with embryo (which contains all the elements that I like about his writing.	2001-08-20
it's a good first novel	Cook's first novel is a pretty good first novel. The plot is simple, two men on the run, chased by a ranger and a girl. there are times when the plot falters a little and cook's believability is uncertain. His characterization is a little shaky. you have della, who is just an uninteresting character, but that isn't unusual for a male to have trouble writing female characters. Ray Bob is too over the top, which does help you root for Eddie, because even though he is a bad man (trying to go right, a little cliche), we have Ray Bob's rabid behavior to make Eddie look good. at the last quarter of the novel, cook tries to show that Ray Bob isn't all bad and that maybe we could sympathize a little with him. but it is too little, too late. perhaps next time cook will humanize his villains earlier in the story. and finally there is the texas ranger, Rule, by far the most interesting character, but by no means a saint. Cook has a great ear for dialect and his locales are dead on (i live in beaumont and i know the places mentioned). _robbers_ shows that cook has huge potential as a regional writer. <br />the book lost stars because at times the story dragged. part of this is cook's lack of quotation marks. i'm not sure what his purpose was here, but it made the story confusing at times and slowed it down at other times. a writer shouldn't try to be experimental just for the sake of being experimental. the book was a bit predictable (i can just see tarantino reading the book saying, 'gee, i'd like to make a movie of it, but i've done it already'). and what has to be the biggest flaw is the ending. the tidy little ending that wrapped everything up so nice and neat. over 350 pages and the reader is cheated at the end. <br />still, the flaws and the good points of the novel balance each other out. i look forward to cook's next novel. i see his potential and i know his sophmore novel will only be better.	2001-08-17
childhood classic	this classic children's book helps to teach children about self-esteem and being different. it's one most of us have read as a child, and one we should pass on to our children. it also has the wonderful illustrations of Gustaf Tenggren (who illustrated the poky little puppy).	2001-08-15
kafka's first book--pure genius	I came across Kafka's first novel after i had finished his short fiction, which impressed me. this story isn't quite what i expected. while stilling holding onto the grimmness that is signature kafka, it manages to use humor in a way i hadn't seen kafka do in his shorter works. &quot;The Stoker&quot;, the story/chapter that begins the book is what Dickens would have done if he had been a better writer. Karl's adventures remind me of Huck Finn's, but without a Jim. Until the last chapter, where the story spirals away from what it had been into substandard work. No, it isn't kafka's best work, but it is still a great piece of art.	2001-08-15
ah, a childhood classic	the poky little puppy is one of those stories everyone has had read to them as a child, and one everyone will read to their children. it has been one of the top selling children's books from its creation. it's one of the best there is.	2001-08-15
written in 83, so it may be outdated	I'm not sure how to feel about this short book of burgess. i admire the man and his work, but you have to wonder about some of his choices. there are so many great books and authors that aren't included in his choices, though i could see the difficulty in picking one book a year. it is interesting to see how burgess' mind works, and the choices he makes, but it is only of interest of a burgess scholar.	2001-08-15
let's hope the run of android popes stop at seven	I ran across a copy of this collection while just looking around the poetry section at my local library. I was a bit surprised to see it, since so many of the great poets aren't represented (pound leaps to mind). I had to read it to see what kind of poet bradbury is. He's an excellent fiction writer, i think Fahrenheit 451 is one of the better books written. His poetry, on the other hand, is horrible. When he rhymes, he rhymes poorly. He tends to drag his poems on a bit (the only poet i can think of who has a greater fear of ending a poem is ginsberg, but the only howl you'll find in this collection is the one coming from the reader). His `ode to ty cobb' is a great example. The poem starts off ok, and has a lot of potential, but bradbury beats the idea to death. Too long (reminds me of one of the poems in the book `too much' `Too much beauty/Too much delight/ Too much of sun' /Too much did he write). You will find some interesting titles, such as `Shakespeare the Father, Freud the Son' (ah, the potential that title has) and `Good Shakespeare's Son, the Typing Ape.' and you'll actually find the line `Hark, we muttered.' i can only hope that mr bradbury decides to stay away from poetry and stick to fiction for the rest of his career. other bad poets: joey froelich (but his work i like in some sick way) and, oh, leonard nimoy, and jimmy stuart.	2001-08-09
worth much more than what you pay	Sandburg is one of the greatest poets the US has had, so much that he became an American icon. His poems use a language that everyone can understand and he speaks of subjects that we all know. He is one of the finest poets we've ever had, and to be able to get this collection for around a dollar, you'd have to be a fool to pass on this.	2001-07-02
a big dissapointment	finally able to get around to reading ginsberg, i was quickly let down. i am a huge fan of the beats. kerouac is one of my favorite writers, burroughs isn't far behind, i believe a lot of what they believe, i love to read about their lives, corso and snyder are poets i like, so i expected to be blown away by ginsberg. he is one of the three leaders of the movement. but his poetry continually let me down. don't get me wrong, he has some wonderful works (howl, kaddish, and a few others), but as a whole, his work is highly dissapointing. i almost wonder if he received his reputation because of friendship with kerouac and cassady or if it all rests on howl. i think he was more a personality than a poet. but i do think this book should be read by anyone serious about poetry, literature, or the beats. he is still an essential poet.	2001-07-02
one of the must-have anthologies	For anyone interested in postmodern poetry or for those who want to learn what postmodern poetry is, this is the anthology to have. It's loaded with some of the best poets: the gifted Robert Duncan, Ferlinghettis (one of the best of the beat poets), Bukowski (my first intro to him, and not a dissapointment), Levertov, Kenneth Koch (not his best poems, but still a good selection), the wonderful poetry of Frank O'Hara, Ginsberg, Robert Creely (and excellent selection), a selection from Ashbery so huge that i almost forgot i wasn't reading one of his books, the awesome Gary Snyder, Rothernberg's &quot;Cokboy&quot;, Dave Trinidad, Paul Hoover, Wanda Coleman, Charles Olson, Kerouac, Philip Whalen, Corso, Amiri Baraka, Diane di Prima, Anne Waldman, and many others, including a very strong Chicago appearance towards the end. <br />The anthology starts with an essay by Hoover, which helps to clear up many questions about what postmodern poetry is and what many of the schools are. He concludes the anthology with a selection of essays on poetry.	2001-06-21
one of the best examples of new narrative poetry	Mason's book is divided into two sections: 1 which contains the long narrative title poem and the 2nd which contains a handful of his other poems (including &quot;Song of the Powers&quot;). I think he might have done better to put &quot;The Country I Remember&quot; after the shorter poems. &quot;The Country I Remember&quot; was such a great poem, that the shorter poems (except &quot;Song of the Powers&quot;) couldn't match up to. &quot;The Country I Remember&quot; is divided into twelve sections, each section told by an alternating point-of-view, between Lt. Mitchell, a Civil War veteran, and his daughter, both at the end of their lives. Mason's skill at the narrative poem is phenomenal. You forget that you are reading a 'long' poem because the story keeps the reader moving forward. Mason writes in both voices extremely well, and at no time are the two distinct and separate voices confused. For people who ask the question as to why there should be narrative poetry, this poem is the answer.	2001-06-20
gioia lives up to his reputation	when reading gioia's first collection, you can't help but wonder if he is overrated. he is one of the most celebrated of the new formalists, and one of the leaders of the movement. you hear over and over how good he is. he is the writer of the &quot;can poetry matter&quot; essay. and, since he is outside the world of academia, you can't help but to think of other poets outside the academic world (wallace stevens and william carlos williams come to mind immediately). so you wonder if the guy is overrated. he's not. he writes formal verse beautifully. he has good control over the meter and line. &quot;The Room Upstairs&quot;, easily one of the best poems in the collection, and my personal favorite, shows gioia's skill as a poet. i look forward to reading the other collections i have.	2001-06-18
another great collection from Gioia	Gioia's latest collection is just as great as his first. He continues to show a wide range of skills (this time adding poems for music, including three songs from his wonderful libretto _Nosferatu_). The longer poem in the middle, Juno Plots Her Revenge, is a beautiful working of Seneca.	2001-06-18
kim's latest collection is as awesome as her first	Tell Me is as wonderful as Philosopher's Club. The poems have a raw, sensuous power to them. They feel confessional without being confessionalist poetry. This is just an awesome collection from a wonderful poet. I'm turning into such a fan of hers that i may have to become president of the fan club.	2001-06-16
stunning first collection	I came across Addonizio's poetry purely by accident. I had never heard of her (actually, i remember seeing her name on the poet's companion, but i had never read her poetry), and i ran across her at a reading in west chester, pa. and i was stunned by it. i picked up philosopher's club, and wasn't dissapointed. the poems inside are sensual poems that radiate sexuality. she works just as well in formal verse as she does in free verse. it is hard to believe that this is her first collection. there is nothing like hearing her read her work, the sensuality of the poems truly comes out when she is reading, but since you can't have her reading every day (unless she comes out with a spoken word cd- we can always hope), this collection should be purchased, and to truly experience the poems, read out loud to yourself.	2001-06-15
beautiful collection	Kate Light's collection is a wonderful collection of poems, especially when you consider that it is her first. The poems, mostly formal, use language in a sensual way. you can feel her training as a musician the way the words float over you, melodious is the word that comes to mind. her poems tend to deal with love, but she manages to pull back before she reaches sentimentality. many of the poems deal with music as well. furthermore, the cover art is most fitting for the collection within. and i happen to know that she picked it herself. great collection. count me as a big fan, and i'm waiting for her next book.	2001-06-15
the first successful pre-raphaelite poet	whatever that is supposed to mean. the poems were, on the whole, rather weak. there are some good poems in here, &quot;Goblin Market&quot; &quot;Up-Hill&quot; and a few others. what really makes the book worthwhile is the care in putting it together. the binding is high quality, the paper is extremely high quality, the art work is beautiful. it's really a book for the eye and the touch. it's a testament to the publishers.	2001-06-12
the latest from hecht	Hecht's verse is always a pleasure to read. You see his intelligence, formal skill, and love of language in his poems. &quot;Nocturne&quot; is Hecht's succesful villanelle, which is one of my favorite formal types of poems, and when it is well done, and it is well done here, it can be one of the most successful forms of poetry. bravo mr. hecht. &quot;Sacrifice&quot; also sticks out in the book. it is a poem in three parts, juxtaposing the story of abraham and isaac with an incident in 1945, which is just chilling. hecht has several successful translations. I was dissapointed in the lack of war poems, which few do better than hecht, and the overabundance of religous poems. the dual picture on the cover lead me to believe that the subject of this collection would be both wwii and religion. i would hope next time knopf would do better in designing the cover.	2001-06-12
one of the beat classics	this is the first book by burrough's that i've read, and i have to say i wasn't dissapointed. it is an easily accessible book, something i was worried about from all i've heard of burroughs. he doesn't preach, either for or against the junk. i will say that it isn't as gritty as i was expecting, but at times you can see through the almost cheerful voice to the darker side underneath.	2001-06-12
a bit of a let down	i am a huge fan of the beats, but i was dissapointed in burroughs' collection of essays. most were dull, some confusing, and none of them really stayed on topic, which would be fine, except the topic was more interesting than the side trips he took. the kerouac essay is essential for anyone who is or likes the beats. it alone makes the book worth the price. and it's good to read after you've read the better beat texts.	2001-05-03
dylan thomas is one of my favorite poet	Years ago i read &quot;do not go gentle into that good night&quot; and i was introduced to dylan thomas. i quickly went out and bought his collected poems, and was totally enraptured by the poet. he has stayed on the top of my favorites, even as i read more and more poetry. this collection is not a complete works. it contains what Daniel Jones (a friend of DT's)  selected out of thomas' works. the collected poems and about 100 other poems, one additional incomplete poem, and 26 poems from DT's juvenalia. it's a good collection, but you can see why dylan thomas did not include these extra poems in his collected poems. they aren't as great as what he can produce. if you love dylan thomas, like i do, then this is a great book to buy, otherwise, you can just stick with the collected poems (those poems were selected by DT himself, as the work he wanted to &quot;save&quot;).	2001-04-20
a classic and the best vampire tale written	I re-read this book about every year to year and a half. that's how great it is. i've included this book with kerouac's on the road, kafka's work, and many other works that have had huge influence on me. everything about the book is great, the voice matheson uses, great plot (ahead of his time using science as an explanation for vampires), believable characters, and a good ending, with one of the best last lines i've ever read.	2001-04-20
autobio from kerouac's inspiration	This book starts with Cassady's autobio of his childhood years, and a brief history of his ancestors. while the prologue was interesting, because of where neal came from, it wasn't as exciting as the actual text of the first third, which was excellent, and why i gave this four stars. it was written in a style very much similar to kerouac. i only wish he had completed the manuscript. following the first third is a selection of NC's unfinished writings, which i have to say was a dissapointment. it isn't much of a surprise that he wrote nothing, and that kerouac is the primary figure of the beats. next follow a few of neal's letters to kerouac, which are a great insight to the mind of one of the central figures of the beats (in fact, one of the letters discussed an incident that i recognize from on the road). the final selection is a letter to ken kesey. i'm sure there are much better letters to chose from, this one was boring and one of the weaker selections. the letters seem to have no particular reason for being here, just to fill the book with cassady's writings. still, a valuable book to have for any fan of the beats.	2001-04-10
read it in one night	morrison's first collection of poetry shows that not only was he a talented musician, but also a first rate poet. divided into two sections, the lords (the first) and the new creatures (the second), some of the greatest lines i've read come from here. the poems in the lords seem to lead into the next one. excellent read. i can't go on enough about this.	2001-04-10
interesting cover design	what we have here is the new and selected collection from the editor of norton's postmodern anthology (and that should tell you something about the poems inside). It's a good collection, though his new poems i found to be much weaker than his older work. There is an excerpt from his long poem &quot;Novel&quot;, which i feel is a must read. The poem's taken from his collection _Viridian_ were wonderful, i haven't read viridian, but i'm sure it is an awesome collection of poems.	2001-04-09
good collection of poems	Breakdown Lane is one of the latest collections of poems by Robert Phillips (as far as i know, only the awesome _Spinach Days_ has followed). While not as good as spinach days, breakdown lane is a worthy collection. It starts with &quot;Face to Face&quot; which is what i feel is Phillips' best poem. The collection is divided into four sections, and only section 2, full of those poems about lost love, is weak.	2001-04-09
great collection	phillips has put together a great collection of poems, full of humor and the sense of craft of the formalist poets. it's full of so many great poems i can't begin to list them all.	2001-04-09
winner of the 1999 national book award	winning the national book award alone is good enough reason to pick this collection up. &quot;Child Beater&quot; is another. Ai's early poems are without a doubt her best work. as she got older, her poems just lost most of the skill she exhibited in her earlier collection.	2001-04-09
great collection of contemporary southern poetry	stokesbury has put together a wonderful collection of the best of the contemporary southern poets. all of them are here: Dickey, Yusef Komunyakaa, Miller Williams, R.S. Gwynn, Alice Walker, Wendell Berry, Fred Chappell, Jarman, Hudgins, Jim Hall, as well as many other southern poets. it's a great collection for anyone interested in contemporary poetry.	2001-04-04
truly inspirational	This is an amazing book about one man's search for enlightenment. It's simple language makes it an easy read, but the philosophy and thought behind it requires you to think. there is so much siddhartha can teach you.	2001-03-17
as inspiring as on the road	there isn't much i can say about the book, like _on the road_ you almost have to read it yourself. but it is inspiring--it moves you, opens you. it leaves me speechless.	2001-03-07
i've waited a long time for this one	I have waited six months since I first heard about R.S. Gwynn's new and selected poems, to publication. And it was worth the wait. It's well-known that Gwynn is one of the best of the New Formalists, and now more people can see why. The collection begins with an introduction by Gwynn's friend, and another of the best of the New Formalists, Dana Gioia. Followed by If By Song, Gwynn's new poems, which contains several of my favorites (&quot;1-800&quot;, &quot;The Classroom at the Mall&quot;, &quot;West Palm&quot;, and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Deadly Sins&quot;), as well as other poems that showcase the poet's wit and skill with poetic form (such as &quot;Black Helicopters,&quot; which holds your interest both in what it says as well as the form it says it). A section covering translations (which I was unaware Gwynn did any translating) and parodies. Once again, Gwynn shows his skill at humorous verse with &quot;Versions for the Millennium&quot; &quot;The Professor's Lot&quot; and the charming &quot;Why They Love Us&quot; (his tribute to the dog). Selections from &quot;The Narcissiad&quot; follows next. This is Gwynn's mock-epic about a poet who battles other poets in the effort to be the only surviving poet. (It's a great poem, I only wish it were still in print, so that I could pick up a copy) And the final section of the book is selections from _The Drive-In_, which is loaded with great poems, such as &quot;Among Philistines&quot;, &quot;Anacreontic&quot; and &quot;The Simplification&quot; which are three of my favorites. It's such a strong selection, that I wish _The Drive-In_ weren't out of print so that I could pick that one up too (I'll be busy searching the used bookstores for copies of these two books). <br />Why should you purchase _No Word of Farewell_? I leave with what Dana Gioia said in his introduction: &quot;I should probably also note two other obvious qualities of Gwynn's poetry. First, he is ingeniously funny. Second, he is an effortless masterof verse forms. No American poet of his generation has written better sonnets, and very few can equal him in the ballade, couplet, rondeau, or pantoum-not to mention the half dozen new forms he has invented. But, to be honest, it was neither Gwynn's considerable formal skill nor his wicked humor that first attracted me, though those qualities surely added to my pleasure. Instead, it was his depth of feeling and intense lyricality.&quot;	2001-02-19
great little book	this is a great collection of bad reviews and rejection letters of great books and authors. it gives the unpublished writer hope, knowing that authors like dickens and joyce were rejected by publishers. and it's loaded with humor.	2001-02-19
real nice collection	ewing has put together a nice history of photographing the body. he divided the book into eleven sections, though most of the photographs could easily be placed in other sections. ewing has eclectic taste, there are works that you almost feel shouldn't be here, and photographers that are severely under represented. but still, all in all, a great book for any art lover.	2001-02-07
one of the best asl dictionaries	this particular asl dictionary is one of the best out there. it's the one i chose for my shelves. it's complete, concise, and the illustrations are easier to understand than most i've seen. if you are interested in asl or a beginner, you could do much worse than pick this book up.	2001-01-30
if you need a tech writing manual...	this text is a bit droll, but what do you expect when considering the topic. it contains a lot that you should already know, but it makes a nice backup reference for writing tech papers or resumes, etc. it's not a must-have book, but it is a good one to own.	2001-01-30
great book	this is a pretty good introduction to photography. the book covers just about everything, including digital photography. for the beginner or anyone who wants to learn how to make images, this book is a great choice.	2001-01-30
a must have	admittedly enough, there are flaws and it isn't the easiest read or as user friendly as it could be. but still, it is a book every social science student and professional should have. there is nothing i need to say, it speaks for itself .	2001-01-30
merely adequate	every english major and writer should have a freshman comp handbook. this one is okay. it covers everything well enough.and if it weren't for the Little, Brown Handbook, i might suggest the Scott, Foresman Handbook. But the little brown handbook is by far superior, and i suggest that anyone interested in the scott foresman, or any other freshman comp handbook, check out the little brown before making a purchase.	2001-01-30
not what it is marketed as	This is a great insight into one of the great writers of our time. This book shows how he works. As a handbook for the upcoming writer, it's only value is in seeing how one of the masters works. though it does not &quot;help&quot; new writers, it is a valuable book because it shows the process michener takes.	2001-01-30
a definite must have	the mla handbook is a must have for any english major (or any other college student), writer, or professional. it's easy to understand and covers everything. it's probably the best help you can have when writing a paper.	2001-01-30
this is THE book	this is the best freshman comp handbook that there is. no doubt about it. anyone who writes anything should have a copy sitting on their shelf.	2001-01-30
it's good for beginners	this is a good book for those who know nothing about photography (thus, the &quot;idiot's guide&quot;). and i gave it four stars for that reason. but, for the amateur or student photographer, this book is worthless. the author covers the basics, and will give the reader a good idea of what photography is and how to take pictures. he gives a great intro to the digital world (this was the first book i bought, but quickly moved on to better, more specific books). i gave the book four stars because it is what it is supposed to be, an introduction to digital photography (you can't fault the author because the reader has some basic knowledge). i would have given him five stars, but, he didn't use photoshop as his program. adobe photoshop is the most widely used digital photography program. most people have it or will get it. so after you learn his tips, you have to relearn or adjust them to photoshop. still, i recommend this to those who don't know anything about digital photography.	2001-01-30
a must for anyone who writes	this (short) book is a must for any writer, whether fiction, nonfiction or academic. the ten lessons help to make your sentences easier to read and understand.	2001-01-29
a wonderful collection of photos of marilyn monroe	This short collection contains some of the greatest photos, and some of the most memorable, of marilyn monroe. the essay by truman capote was charming and showed us a good deal of the real marilyn. my only complaint is that it ended too soon.	2001-01-29
interesting	it's an interesting book filled with little known details about death and other endings. i was at a loss as to what rating to give the book. he wasted time on the extinctions, though he picked the largest extinctions, they are also some of the dullest. Too many pages were spent on wills and other mundane thing. but, when he discussed the deaths and last words of famous people throughout history, the book really picked up. but i can see how much research he put into the book, so i gave him four stars instead of three.	2001-01-17
another one from wilson	once again charles wilson has written a suspensful technothriller. a bit of a slow starter, but once he gets going... the further i got into the book, the faster i was reading, and the more taunt wilson kept it. a good job.	2001-01-11
an excellent collection of photos	this is an excellent collection of photos from a guy, who i never heard of. when i first started looking at this book, i didn't really like the photos. a lot of the reason is because the photos look kind of dated, definately a 70s look. but as i went further into the book and was able to ignore the hairstyles, i could see the work hester put into posing these models. most of the pictures are classically posed. very much like the ancient greek sculptures (i could go into the vocabulary i learned in art history, but i won't). another intersting technique of hester's is that he used the same camera, film, and lighting (more or less) for each of the photos. i have to say, good job.	2000-12-30
not an art book	this book is not a book of art to look at, rather it is more of an instructional book, how to photograph nudes. though i don't think that these principles apply just to nudes, you could use them on any portriature. hedgecoe really has the basics down. the problem with the book, why i only gave it a three, is that the examples he uses are not very good pictures. i've never seen any of his other work, so i don't know what kind of photographer he is, but my understanding is that he can create better images that was shown in this book (in fact, many of the pictures look like leftovers from his work done in the late 70s early 80s). also, many of the techniques he describes are ones any photographer should know about, or at least any photographer who isn't just starting out. and a beginning photographer shouldn't try to take on nudes until they have a little experience under their belt. the final problem with the book is hedgecoe's apparent surprise at using computer imaging. it almost feels like he has just discovered the digital camera and photoshop. <br />it's not a horrible book, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't a beginner.	2000-12-30
a pity	i tried to like this collection, i really did. it came highly recommended to me by a poet that i respect and whose work i like. but stokesbury just couldn't impress me. most of his poems were confusing, rambling, and just weren't coherent. there were a few clever poems, and &quot;Evening's End&quot; is a great poem, definately his best. the collection is weak, but this poem alone makes it worthy to pick up a copy. and you'll find a few other gems in the collection.	2000-12-13
a stunning book	sturges collection is a stunning, beautiful book. i know there has been some controversy around this work because of the age of most of the people photographed. i am very careful about watching the line between photography and pornography, and after looking at this collection, i cannot call this child pornography. sturges' photographs give these people, both the young and the old, beauty and dignity. i can only hope that he will not allow censorship from the closed minded to stop his work.	2000-11-21
a great drama anthology	it has to be hard to put together a good anthology of drama, in such a short format. i know there are many other plays gwynn would have liked to have included in this collection, but being limited by space he had to pick and choose. the collection starts with Oedipus Rex, representing the earliest days of drama, and the best example of greek drama. gwynn then moves on to shakespeare with his selection of othello. there could be some arguement as to the shakespeare play to include, but othello is one of the better works. next is ibsen's a doll house, followed by chekov's three sisters (and what drama anthology would be complete without chekov). then gwyn has the glass menagerie and death of a salesman. it's understandable why oniel is not represented here, since both tennessee williams and arthur miller are here, oniel would have made it an overrepresentation of american plawrites in the period. a raisin in the sun follows. and he finishes the anthology with a one act, experimental play by Maria Irene Fornes, Dr. Kheal. this is the only weak point in the anthology, i think with a little more effort, he could have found a better selection to include.	2000-11-13
distrubing	I have to say this is truly a horrifying book, because it isn't made up or staged, there are almost 100 plates and they are real photographs from our history. and as horrifying as the pictures are, i think the plate descriptions of the circumstances are even more horrifying. this is a very important book, and one you definately should have. <br />the other thing i have to say about this book is the cover design: it's excellent for the subject matter. a plain black cover, with a narrow strip, only slightly larger than the hanging man, set off to the right.	2000-11-13
a masterpiece	this is one of the classics of drama. you should read it.	2000-11-13
a classic play	some have said ibsen's classic play is outdated, but i would have to disagree. many of the issues (about women) dealt with in this play are still valid. it's well written and well thought out. you should read it	2000-11-13
the classic play	this is  one of the best plays ever written, as well as one of the earliest. oedipus has become very much a part of our culture, and the oedipus plays should be required reading. fitzgerald and fitts did a wonderful job in the translation.	2000-11-13
a stunning new collection from keith carter	i admit i was skeptic when i first heard about this book, and i had no intentions of buying it. i'm not that crazy about horses. but i got a look at an advanced copy, and i saw the the work was just beautiful and i had to have it. be sure to look at orange tree and nude and arabian, which are my two favorite pictures.	2000-11-12
it's a nice little collection	this collection is a nice little collection of poems, but outside of the 20 unholy sonnets, nothing great. still, it's a nice collection from a contemporary poet.	2000-11-10
one of the greats?	as a lit major, i've heard lots about raymond carver as one of the masters of the short story, but i'm afraid that I have to disagree. carver spent part of his career known as a minimalist, meaning that every word in his stories carries meaning and there are no extras in them. that makes for quick reads, but I found the stories lacking. carver seems to skip important pieces of his stories and many of them don't seem to have an ending. they just cut off. I'm not saying that carver's work is not worth reading. it is. he was an important figure in american literature, and he is not a bad writer, I just find other authors, such as cheever, hemingway, and hawthorne to be the true &quot;masters&quot; of american short fiction. In fact, stories such as &quot;so much water so close to home,&quot; &quot;where i'm calling from,&quot; &quot;what we talk about when we talk about love,&quot; &quot;a small good thing,&quot; and &quot;they're not your husband&quot; to be excellent stories, and they alone make this collection worth purchasing.	2000-11-07
A different kind of apocalyptic novel	An interesting &quot;what if&quot; novel dealing with the cuban missel crisis, what if things had turned out differently and the soviet union and the u.s. went to war. At least that is the premise of the novel, it's setting. <br />What the story really is is part love story, part espionage story. Dubois keeps the story moving with various turns in the plot and some interesting background story as to what it is like in this alternate world. He creates likeable, believable characters.  It's good for some light reading.	2000-11-07
a memoir from the king	_On Writing_ was not quite what I expected. I have several &quot;how to&quot; books on writing, so I know what to expect out of one. This book surprised me. King spends less than 100 pages on the mechanics of writing. The first part of the book is a memoir of (certain parts) his life. And he follows the on writing section with a commentary on the accident that almost killed him. But just because he doesn't spend much time discussing how to write doesn't make this book unworthy of reading. In fact, it is one of his better books. Unlike his previous work of non-fiction, _Danse Macabre_, king's voice comes through. It's almost like you're sitting at a diner drinking coffee while stephen king talks to you about his life (and who wouldn't take a few hours from our lives to talk to the king). It's entertaining and informative. Anyone who is a fan of his will love this first section (titled C.V. and i'm still trying to figure out what it stands for). One of my favorite aspects of a writer is his/her voice in the work, and king has fully developed his voice for this one. And the final section, on living, is haunting. The conversational tone king used throughout the book is gone when we get here. Instead it's a more disembodied voice, almost like he wasn't involved in the accident and is just reporting it. I never realized how serious the accident was until I read this. This section touched me more than any other work king has done. He wraps the book up with a list of books he has read the past couple of years (and it is not surprising to see the range of his tastes) and an example of the revision process, from one of his own short stories. <br />I say you definitely have to pick this book up. It is his best yet.	2000-11-07
a sweet little book	this is a sweet little (inexpensive) book of dogs. there are around 500 photos in this collection, which is why i only gave it three stars. erwitt should have culled through the photos a bit more. because of the sheer quantity of pictures in this collection, you have an over-abundance of mediocre and &quot;average&quot; shots, and a few bad ones. but there are many good phtots in this collection, but i think the book would have been strnoger if erwitt had cut it back to a hundred (or less) photos.	2000-10-28
a new type of devotional poetry	Jarman's Unholy Sonnets is a sequence of sonnets written to follow his previous collection, Questions for Ecclesiastes. Almost every type of sonnet is found in this collection. The sonnets are a form of devotional poetry, unlike what has been written before, such as Donne's sonnets, which is why Jarman wrote Questions for Ecclesiastes and Unholy Sonnets, as a response to Donne. Jarman's sonnets are a different type of devotional poetry. He doesn't just worship God, but asks questions about the nature of God and spirituality, thus the title unholy.       One of the things Jarman does in these sonnets is to question God with lines like &quot;Soften the blow, imagined God, and give/Me one good reason for this punishment&quot; from sonnet 3. And sonnet 6 where he questions his relationship with God. And Jarman's poetry continues on this way throughout the entire sequence, fifty sonnets dealing with prayer, judgement, religion, and even science versus religion.       Most of the sonnets in the sequence are pretty good, though a few, like sonnet 1, 3, and the prologue sonnet stand out as excellent poems, and there are a few that are truly horrible like 27 and 35 which are unclear and the rhymes are either sound forced or just aren't very good. But the well crafted sonnets outweigh the poorer sonnets.	2000-10-19
from the exhibition	this was a nicely done book that helps show you the importance of the poet's original manuscript. all poets and poetry lovers should pick this one up.	2000-09-23
not his best work	first of all, i want to say to anyone reading this review, don't get me wrong, tupac was a brilliant artist. i'm not giving him or his music 2 stars, but this collection of &quot;poetry&quot; does get the 2 stars. it was a horrible collection. i bought it expecting so much more, but he makes the mistakes that so many other young poets make when writing. in fact, i the only reason i'm even giving it 2 stars is one for each of the good poems in the collection (the rose that grew from concrete &amp; in the event of my demise). there is a lot of promise in the poems, but he needed more work. if you really want to find tupac's poetry, listen to his music. that's where his poetry is.	2000-09-23
definately worth the [price]	this is a collection of 46 figure drawings michelangelo did. michelangelo  was a master painter and sculptor, he rendered figures more beautifully  than any other artist ever has. most of the drawings in this book are  studies he did for his paintings and sculptures. and he was a master  draftsman. the book is in a workbook style binding so it takes up little  space, but it is a hardy book. it is well worth the...price.	2000-09-11
nice images	keith carter's new book of photographs is a beautifully put together book.  the publishers did an excellent job, they made a book that just looks  beautiful, though i do see where keeping it in good condition might get to  be a problem. the images are beautiful images, but after a while you do get  a little tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. it's not as  good as 25 Years, but i'd still recommend this book as an excellent  purchase.	2000-08-21
Insights from the King	this was a wonderful collection of interviews of Stephen King. It would be  interesting to see another collection done, with some of the more recent  interviews and thoughts from him.	2000-08-21
Words about one of the greatest composers	this short collection of quotes helped me learn a lot about mozart and  opinion of him, but there weren't too many memorable lines. still, if you  are a fan of mozart's this is an interesting collection.	2000-08-21
it's almost as big as arnold	this is an excellent book written by the guy everyone associates with the  sport. it has great information on the history of bodybuilding and tips on  competing. but you don't have to be a bodybuilder to enjoy this book. i'm  not. i'm just a guy who goes to the gym to keep in shape and have the  physicality i want. and arnold's book can be a great help, especially if  you are like me and get bored with certain exercises easily. the part of  the book that really makes it all worthwhile is the section(s) that deal  with the different exercises for each body part.	2000-08-10
intimate thoughts from the master of the american short stor	this collection of interviews is great for any fan of Cheever's work. it does get a bit repetitious, but there is so much about the man (and the author) in these interviews	2000-07-12
back on track	when i first read romkey's I, Vampire, i was so impressed. here was a vampire book that was different from most, and outstandingly done. but as the &quot;series&quot; went on, the novels started to get weaker and  weaker, but now, finally, romkey has written a novel as good as his first  ones.	2000-06-30
a most awesome collection	it is about time that a new anthology of america's true city of letters was published. this collection covers the biggest names in chicago writing (or any literature period) to the moer obscure authors. it's all here,  novel extracts, poems, memoirs, essays, articles, stories, drama... and  there is so much more to chicago style writing than what is in this  collection, as is pointed out in the afterward. but this is an excellent  place to start. i highly recommend this collection to everyone, and i think  that those who love chicago or live in chicago should be required to read  it.	2000-06-30
excellent debut	Erica Jong's debute book of poetry is quite a fine collection of work. to be honest, i didn't realize a person could allude to so much with vegetables, especially onions.	2000-06-07
great poet	Sandburg was a superb poet. he speaks in such a raw voice, that the poems cannot help but to reach out and touch you, whether he writes about love, injustice, protest, war, chicago or any other subject.	2000-05-11
for the lover of sylvia plath	a deep look into the life of sylvia plath and how she affected her husband, ted hughes.	2000-05-06
nice text	Sommers has edited a pretty good text for basic writing composition. Sommers covers the range of writing voices excellently. he keeps the explanations simple for the layperson. The essays in this selection are  great essays, many of them those you wouldn't normally come across. there  are times when sommers could have selected a better choice for an example.  but still, a good text. it is a shame it is out of print.	2000-04-16
not that great	I was dissapointed by Lewis' poems. true, their range was one of the largest i've seen (from sci-fi to christian poems), but most were dull and just didn't live up to his reputation. i'd say stick with his fiction like  the chronicles of narnia and the dark tower and other stories	2000-04-10
from her reputation, i expected better	millay's collection of poems was not, in my opinion, a very good one. there were a dozen or so good poems (most of them from her collection _A Few Figs From Thistles_), but most were just not very good.	2000-03-31
powerful	sapphire's collection of poems and short stories is a powerful collection, though the poems are much more so than her short fiction. they are intense personal experiences and by the time you finish the collection, you have a  good idea of what happened to her during her life. it would be interesting  to read work by her that does not relate to racial bigotry, abuse or  lesbianism, but that seems to be where she is able to draw the raw energy  that she writes with.	2000-03-31
disapointing	this collection of kerouac's poems was a great dissapointment. i love his fiction (especially on the road), but his poetry left something to be desired.	2000-03-31
the best	dylan thomas is the most powerful poet. he has a beautiful command of the language. he is one of my favorite poets (Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night might be my favorite poem), perhaps the only one i like better might  be robert frost. this collection is a must for anyone. it should be  required reading.	2000-03-31
great	prufrock and the wasteland have to be the finest work produced by eliot, and it is great to see them collected in this inexpensive, short collection.	2000-03-14
a good beginning, but didn't quite finish it right	The first four parts of this book were superbly done. I mean, Disch did an excellent job telling this story, but then the fifth part came. It was a major letdown. Disch couldn't &quot;close the deal.&quot; Maybe if he had started the story off in this future he had created, it would have been a  better ending, though i think it would have been better if he had just kept  on the same vein he was in. Disch was trying to go for a deeper shock  value, a deeper sense of outrage and wrong, but his style in the final  section of the book just didn't keep up with the rest of the story.	2000-03-14
one of the greatest wits	dorothy parker was one of the sharpest wits we've ever seen, and this collection of poems shows her talents at their best. you do get a little tired of her cynicism after a while, but her first two classics, Enough Rope &amp; Sunset Gun both make it worthwhile to read. she is one of the  best poets we've had.	2000-03-14
the best of the confessionalists	there isn't much i can say about sylvia plath that hasn't already been said. this is a wonderful collection of poems by one of the greatest contemporary female poets. the later works are her best (1962-3), and it  was nice to have seen some of her juvenalia. a must for a poetry lover	2000-02-13
not a bad disaster book	as disaster novels go, this one picks a disaster not too much touched upon, the new madrid fault zone. it's not as well known as california, though if you've taken any geology classes you know that this is the  biggest, and has the most potential for destruction. some of the science  seemed pretty good, some seemed pretty bad. the characters weren't all that  great. the best thing about this book is drawing attention to the new  madrid area.	2000-02-03
a dissapointment	don't get me wrong, i'm not saying it was a bad book, but i know what these two are capable of writing, and they can do better than this. the idea behind the story is overdone and wasn't all that interesting to begin  with. the characters aren't as dynamic as they usually are in their books,  but i didi like the water pit.	2000-02-03
a great dissapointment by a master of the anti-utopia	we know huxley is a master in the literary world, and we know that he can write anti-utopian fiction, just read Brave New World. this is along the same lines, though without the niceties of BNW. and without the excellence  of BNW. maybe it was the experimentation Huxley did with the form of the  novel. but huxley still says a lot, perhaps more in this than he did in  BNW. i'd recommend reading it just for the philosophy of huxley, but if you  are expecting BNW, you are going to be dissapointed.	2000-02-03
not too bad	what we have here is an interesting scenario, what if a volcanoe erupted and caused volcanic winter throughout the northern hemisphere. and to top it off there is some severe tensions between england and ireland. pretty  good book.	2000-02-03
just a bit too preachy	i picked this book up because, 1) i am an x-fan, and 2) i was looking for a light read. boy i was wrong. this book looked into the prison system of today's world, and she had a lot to say, too much to go into here (though i  would like to remind the author, that the people in prisons are criminals,  so the sympathy and their rights can only go so far). we also get the  author's view on the dangers of technology and out addiction to tv and  video games. the book actually turned out to be a bit of a dissapointment.  the story wasn't that great, and it was a bit preachy. go with the other  x-titles.	2000-02-03
truly, he was the master	the only complete collection of hemingway's short stories. and he was the master of the short story. this is a collection that should be on everyone's shelf. there is nothing i can say, you have to read it.	2000-02-03
excellent short read	for such a short book, carrere seems to have packed everything into that he could. this book is very suspensful. nicholas, the main char, has a very active imagination and reads way too much horror, and carrere uses that to  build the tension, suspense and dread as the story reaches its climax. the  author did an excellent job telling the story from a child's point of view.  there is no overt sex in the story, but throughout you get a hint of  homoeroticism.	2000-02-03
great idea, not so great book	still a good book, but not as good as crews' other books. still, it's one i'd recommend.	2000-02-02
man, this is just awesome	i don't even know where to begin with a book like on the road. it's full of so much energy, so much intensity, it is a musical, poetic read. it's one everyone should read, and it deserves to be re-read over and over.	2000-02-02
Fairly good retrospective of Time Mag	I've always been a fan of Time Magazine, and i think in general it is a good magazine. it was nice to see the history of the Time, but there was a lot they left out. i don't highly recommend this book, but then i don't  chase anyone away from it either.	2000-02-02
good book	what can i say about it that isn't said below, i just wanted to add my four stars	2000-02-02
better than it's predecessor, Empire of Ice	This time Moran focuses on the states. There is some pretty unbelievable science in this book, such as their plan to divert the Gulf Stream (though i don't know, maybe it could be done)We have a different enemy in this  edition, mainly Argentina and the S. Hemisphere countries, who have risen  in power since the crippling of agriculture in the northern hemisphere.  good book.	2000-02-02
dull	it's a good story. and i like the fact that we are told the story from Judas' point of view. you get to see the politics surrounding christ and you see that judas isn't evil, just a man, a patriot. but the writing style  is boring, slow, and dull.	2000-02-02
Not a great collection of quotes	I was rather dissapointed in this. i got it years ago with some desk set, but never got around to reading it. Now, i find myself collecting quotes that i like, so i decided to read this collection. There were some good  quotes, but most weren't. His division of the quotes was at times  confusing. I think i could do a better job.	2000-01-23
A Great Classic	I first read this book in high school, and i didn't like it much, which was surprising because i really enjoy Hawthorne's short fiction. i again picked it up recently, and found that loved it. There no doubt that it is a  difficult book to read, Hawthorne requires the reader to think as he reads.  everything is symbolic of something in this book. Hawthorne has a mastery  of the language that you just don't see anymore. think this is one we  should re-read every few years, as we mature. I got the Norton edition,  which helps a little with understanding the story, but most of the articles  were not that helpful.	2000-01-23
concise, informative	This book is a nice introduction for the layperson to the history of ertotic art. It gives the background, but doesn't go over the average person's head. Some very nice art in here, though i think most of the  poetry and some of the prose wasn't all that great. i do wish that  lucie-smith had put the art of those he talked about in the text together,  so that the reader can see an example of what he is discussing.	2000-01-23
I'm Impressed	I first bought this collection of poems years ago, because I am a fan of Louis L'Amour (at the time I wasn't so much a fan of poetry). I didn't remember much of it when I picked it up again to reread it, but I am  impressed. L'Amour was quite a capable poet. There are many good poems in  this collection that you really won't see elsewhere.	2000-01-22
Not a bad collection	This isn't a bad collection of poems, in fact there were quite a few that I liked. I recommend it.	2000-01-22
a fair collection	This collection of Jeffers' best poems is a fairly good one. You realize a few things about the poet. One is that I don't think the man knows how to write a short poem. The second is that he is extremely critical of the  human species, and America in particular. You can see his theology  background (his father) in the religious tones in many of his poems.  There's also a lot of hawks in his poems. It seemed like every third poem  or so there was a hawk. I also suspect that he wanted to be a sculpture.  There are a lot of sculptures and stones in his poems. The preachy tone  does get to be a bit much, and you get real sick of hawks by the time you  are finished, but there are some really good poems in the collection.  &quot;The Stone Cutters,&quot; &quot;Contemplation of the Sword,&quot;  &quot;The House Dog's Grave,&quot; and &quot;Roan Stallion&quot; being the  best he has to offer.	2000-01-22
a bit dissapointing	This collection was not quite as great as i was hoping. the poems were nice to have, most aren't in the complete tales and poems. i especially like the lines on ale. the letters were truly a gem to read. it gave a nice  view of poe's thoughts and a hint of his wit. the selection from poe's  marginalia gave a wonderful insight to his mind. but the essays by the  french were dull and really didn't give any new information, other than his  worship by the french. i recommend this collection only for the poe  enthusiast (like me).	2000-01-22
not horror, but a good book	I picked this book up shortly after it's re-release, and it has taken me quite a while to get around to reading it. I'm not sure why I picked it up, because when I stared reading it, I wasn't expecting much. One interesting  thing I noted, was that the book was first published in 1978 (the  re-release coincided with Dolly). And I don't know what the status of  cloning was at that time, but it seems remarkably ahead of its time. It  struck as a book like The Hot Zone, a book written (in a somewhat  fictitious way) of something that really happened, though I know that this  book didn't. Still, that is the way it read, and I found it enjoyable to  read that way. But don't be taken in by the synopsis on the back of the  book, which made the clone sound like he was the evil, when in fact, it was  Alfred (who the clone came from) who was more evil. Though I don't think  I'd necessarily call him evil, just cold and way too driven by science. I  don't know how the science stacks up, but if you are looking for a  relaxing, entertaining read, go ahead and pick this up.	2000-01-22
good book	Kanon took one of the most interesting and fascinating event in modern american history and put a mystery in it, and then put a love story in that (which was probably the weakest sub-plot of the book). but i'd say it was  more of an espionage story. kanon did an excellent job.	2000-01-19
one of the classics of all time	what doesn't this book have. action, adventure, excitement, war, it has everything. it's written in an easy to understand language (tho' that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll pick up on the symbolism that golding  put into everything). and you definately get a totally different perception  of the book as you get older (this is my third reading of it, and each  time, i get something different from it). i think this should be required  reading and that everyone should own a copy.	2000-01-19
not one of her better works	after reading P&amp;P and Northanger, i just couldn't slog my way through another of her books. but this one looked more interesting than any of her other works, so i thought, &quot;why not, i'll give it a try.&quot; big  mistake. by far her worst (that i've read, but i still have emma and  s&amp;s to go, and no plans on ever reading mansfield park). but i think it  is safe to say i am not a fan of austen's. she's dull, and she turned an  interesting idea into a dull book. i only gave her two stars instead of one  because the premise behind the book was such a good one.	2000-01-19
Kanon tops los alamos	Kanon seems to have a knack for spy stories written during the more interesting time in recent american history. but this story was also about the relationship between nick and his father. the biggest problem i had  with the book was that the main villain, Silver, was obvious who it was  from the very beginning.	2000-01-19
some great photos	This collection had some great photos and poems. there were many times when i couldn't see how the poems and stories fit with the theme, but the photos were great, and they fit very well with the theme of the collection.  it's definately a book i recommend.	2000-01-19
such a dissapointment	i am a huge fan of the work hickman and weiss have put out together. and i have read weiss without hickman, and i still like her work. and i've read hickman's The Immortals, and it was excellent, so i was rather dissapointed  in this book. it was slow, dull, i couldn't even finish it, and believe me,  i tried. i know the man has more talent than what i saw in this work.  hopefully his next solo novel will be up the par of The Immortals.	2000-01-19
dulldulldulldull	For a book that i heard so much about when it was published, i was rather surprised to find how dull it was. it's an interesting subject, but the author just couldn't pull it off.	2000-01-19
typical jane austen	another book of hers i've read, and i swear, i can't tell them apart in my mind. it's almost as if you read one, you've read them all. most of them i don't even finish, though i did finish this one. not quite as good as P  &amp; P, but that could just be because that was the first of austen's work  i read, and they all seem like P&amp;P. the ending to northanger was awful.  all tell and no show. but that seems to be a common problem with her, she  summarizes too much and doesn't really tell us a story. still, one of her  worthier books.	2000-01-19
It's not wonder no living poet has been more honored	Gwendolyn Brooks is one of the masters of poetry. she is probably the greatest living poet, one of the best modern poets, and one of the better poets of all time. for anyone who loves poetry, their library shouldn't be  without this volume.	2000-01-18
good poetry	i never knew hemingway was a poet. but i'm glad he was, since several of these poems are excellent, and most are good (and quite a few bitter). i'm not surprised hemingway's poems are good since it would seem to fit his  style of write, every sentence, every word important.	2000-01-18
a sad ending to a great poet	I thought long and hard about what to say about this final collection of Ginsberg's. As a poet, he was one of the best, and it is out of sentiment and respect that made me want to like his final poems. But in reality, they  do not stand up to his former work. I almost find it hard to believe that  this is the same man who wrote Howl, Kaddish, and others. It was  interesting to see what Ginsberg's state of mind was at the end. It would  appear that it was mostly scatological thoughts and political ravings. Not  that I mind those types of poems, if they are well written. But still, it  is a collection that I would recommend for your personal library, if only  because it is Ginsberg's last. Though there were some good poems and  interesting thoughts in this collection. We will miss Ginsberg.	2000-01-15
nice effort	jewel should stick to singing. Her poetry isn't as bad as I was expecting, but it wasn't that great. She seemed to be stuck on theme, love, or rather a loss of love. Which is fine for some poems, but when all but two or three  of your poems turn out to be sappy, broken-hearted whining, it's time to  find something else. She had a lot of good ideas and lines but the total  package was disappointing. The prologue was nice. And the paintings  featured throughout the collection looked more or less like the same one,  over and over.	2000-01-13
understandably a classic	There is no question in my mind why On the Beach is considered a classic in the sci fi genre and the sub-genre, apocalyptic fiction. This book had an interesting spin on it because of the way the world ends. The northern  hemisphere has destroyed itself in nuclear war. The radiation slowly drifts  down to the southern hemisphere. This book takes place in southern  australia, one of the last places to get the radiation. It's not so much  about the end of the world, but how you deal with the knowledge that you  are going to die, and you know roughly when and how. Excellent book, even  if you aren't a fan of sci fi or end of the world/nuclear holocaust  stories, this one should be picked up because it is more a story of human  nature than science fiction.	2000-01-13
definately not her mother	maybe I expected more out of the daughter of sylvia plath and ted hughes, and maybe it isn't fair that I expected something better, but I was disappointed. Perhaps if I hadn't known who her parents were I might have  read this differently. She's not a bad poet, just not that great of one.  The poems give off a feeling of repetition, and I just don't know if a  kookaburra is something I need to see in 20 or so poems. And by the end of  the collection, i'm a little tired of hearing about foxes. i would have  liked to have seen more poems about growing up the daughter of sylvia plath  and ted hughes and what her life was like and her issues with her parents  to have come out in the poems. She had some good lines and some really good  ideas, but she just couldn't seem to pull it together. There were a couple  of good poems in there though.	2000-01-13
bad poetry, but I still like it	I first read this collection shortly after it first came out (the other review is mine too), before I knew anything about poetry. I didn't realize  just how bad of a poet froelich is. But I've since then re-read the book.  There is no doubt that it is bad poetry, but still poetry that for some  reason I enjoy. He does harp on lost love a bit too much. I can't really  recommend this book because froelich is an awful poet (have I mentioned  that yet?), but still, I like him.	2000-01-13
a nice look at the outlaws of poetry	This was a pretty good collection of poetry. about a third of it was really bad, about a third of it was okay, good poetry, but there was a third of it that was outstanding poetry. one problem i had was that many of the well-known great poets in this collection contributed work that  definately wasn't their best. and i'm sure they left some out. but still,  i'd say it definately needs to be in any poet's collection.	2000-01-10
even the book looks like it could survive anything	An interesting and charming little book full of the things we see in movies and wondered how to do. Not a whole lot of practical value, but interesting nevertheless.	2000-01-09
great collection	I am both a fan of formal poetry and free verse, but it always seemed like contemporary poets only wrote in free verse. i couldn't find any modern formal poetry. that's why this collection was such a wonderful little gem to find. some of the better poets born after 1950 are included here.	2000-01-09
one of the classics of apocalyptic fiction	Stewart's Earth Abides has long been considered a classic in the sci-fi genre and a classic apocalyptic novel (it even helped to inspire Stephen King's The Stand). And it is no wonder why. Stewart has a highly  believable, excellently written story here. Though it does lose something  in the the third part of the book, when Ish is an old man. One you should  definately pick up.	2000-01-09
after reading the revies, i don't know if lewis wrote it,	but i still liked it. Most of the stories in this collection can be found elsewhere. What makes this collection a treasure is the two incomplete novels, The Dark Tower and After Ten Years, both of which are well written  enjoyable stories that I wish I could read the end to. also included are  several other excellent stories by lewis. A definite must have for any  sci-fi fan.	2000-01-09
the best poetry anthology i've seen	this was an excellent comprehensive view of poetry. there were a few poets and poems that i felt should have been included, but in less than 400 pages, he picked the best poems that there are. it's probably the best collection i've ever seen, especially given it's small size (which is a  plus when you are used to handleing those huge anthologies). the  introduction to poetry is informative.	2000-01-09
interesting play	i found this play to be very interesting. i don't know if i'd call it a comedy, other than the absurdity of the characters. it's one i'd be interested in seeing performed.	2000-01-08
a different kind of King tale	I finally bought TGWLTG Thursday. I started reading it Friday and finished that night. it was a pretty good book. i think it is different from most of king's work. in fact i don't know if i'd call this book horror. the things  that are horrific about the book could be just in her mind, and that's what  i think they are. (well, the location, near TR90, makes me wonder about  that though). it was interesting the way i read it. i had gotten off of  work, and i was tired from the day before as well as work that day. i had  to take my two hour train ride to get home (after walking 45 mins to get to  the train station). when i got there, nobody was home, and i hadn't had a  key to the apt at that time, so i sat on the steps (very uncomfortable  steps) for 4 1/2 hours waiting for someone to get home to let me in. let me  tell you, when you are tired and hungry and sore and very uncomfortable and  you are reading a book about a lost girl who is tired and hungry and sore  and very uncomfortable...well, it adds something to the book.	1999-05-30
wow	i read the great gatsby and i was impressed. i don't really know what to say about it. it was an excellent book. it is definately required reading	1999-05-30
ugh	i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow  going and to be quite honest, boring.	1999-05-19
surprisingly, substandard	Well, I finished revelations ed by Douglas E. Winter. I appreciate what he tried to do here, a novel of short stories, and it was a good idea, but it just seemed to fall flat. I could never quite see the connection between  the stories. But it fell short. And I was surprised that this wasn't that  great, because Winter put together _Prime Evil_, which I truly enjoyed.   <br />Clive Barker's wraparound story wasn't very good. It had some  interesting parts to it, but really, not his best work.  Landsdale, who  wrote the first story (each story took place in a different decade...but I'm  not sure when barker's story took place) wasn't too bad. David Morrell's  story I'd say the same about. F. Paul Wilson's story about Nazi Germany was  excellent. Probably the best in the book. Poppy Z. Brite and Christa  Faust's story was a good one.  charles grant's story wasn't bad. Whitley  Streiber wrote an unintelligable, very bad story for the 50s decade. I  never really caught on to what was happening. Elizabeth massie wrote what  would be the second best story in the book, it too was excellent. Matheson,  who I know is a good writer wrote some garbage for the book...it sucked.  David J. Schow and Craig Spector wrote a story for this book that was okay,  it was almost good, but something is missing from it (hmm...I wonder if  that'd be Skipp).  And since at least half of this book was bad, I was  worried when I got to the last decade/story which was written by ramsey  campbell. Luckily he wrote a pretty good story.	1999-05-19
awful, awful, awful	i just finished reading this book called vampire blood by kathryn meyer griffith. anyone read this? (anyone ever even heard of this book?) and i have to say it was just awful. i don't quite know why i continued to read  it. the plot was a standard plot. the story was not well written, the  dialogue was cheesy. the most interesting characters, the two main  vampires, were not explored at all, while the reader learns about the main  char and her family, and these people are boring and not at all believable.  the ending was predictable. and the main char's ex-husband comes back into  the picture, and i know that i was supposed to root for these two to get  back together and triumph over the vampires, but all i wanted was for the  vampires to kill them...i mean put me out of my misery. and jeff (the ex)  was such a whiney baby...i don't know what the main char. saw in him. talk  about whipped...anyway, if you haven't read it...don't. trust me.	1999-05-17
one of wilson's best	i thought that this book was one of wilson's best works, and certainly the best of his last four books published by st. martin's. it's great the way wilson pulls this large cast of char. and makes them all part of the story.  he's really at his best when writing a suspense/thriller/mystery type  story, and that is what this book is more of. hopefully we'll be seeing  more of this quality of books coming from wilson.	1999-05-16
well, i liked it	i enjoyed this book. admittedly, it isn't his best work, but it is still a good book. really, with almost 500 reviews there isn't much that i'm going to say because the odds of anyone reading this... anyway, it's a good book.  check it out.	1999-05-16
excellent text	I came across this book for my Poetic Analysis class in college.  It is an exellent book on meter and form.  I can't even say how much this book has helped me with both reading and writing poetry.  If you want to write  better poetry or understand the poetry you read, then this is a good book  to pick up.	1999-03-31
It was hard to know how to rate this book	I just didn't know how to rate it.  The science of the book wasn't that great, and a bit outdated.  The science of the book became laughable when they finally met up with the hominids.  Surprising since some of Darnton's  reference sources are from good people.  But it is fiction, so there are  some concessions that can be made if there is a good story.  The problem is  that the story wasn't all that great.  I admit, I didn't want to just throw  it away, but it wasn't great.  It was mediocre.  I'm surprised that it made  The Book-of-the-Month Club main selection.  at best, this is a mediocre  story about unintersting characters.  Matt and Susan's reintroduction into  their romance was just not believeable...maybe it was because there really  weren't any other sapiens to chose from. Kellicut's character was...awful,  a horrible portrayal.  Sergei really wasn't a character.  The hominids were  either too pacifistic or to evil.  They are closely related to humans (or  even the same species) so they would be a little more complex than Darnton  made them.  The most interesting characters were those in the institute  (except the marines which really could have been left out.  did they even  have a part?), but even they weren't that great.  All in all, I'd have to  say two thumbs down Mr. Darnton.  Stick to journalism and don't torture us  with this kind of drudge anymore.	1999-03-28
pretty good	this was the first book in the series that I have read (though i've seen clan of the cave bear, and i own all the books so that i can read them eventually, but then this was required for a class) and it is very good.   even though i haven't read the first two books, auel really got me to care  about what happened to ayla and jondalar.  especially with the little love  triangle.  the only problem i have with this book is that ayla seems to  have invented everything.  i mean, this woman must be a god or something.   it's like femenism going overboard.  i understand she is intelligent and  resourceful, but maybe auel could allow someone else to invent the wheel  (i'm surprised there was fire before ayla was able to invent it).  but  still, it is a good book and the series looks promising.	1999-03-06
beautiful collection	This has to be the best collection of nude/erotic photography and poetry ever compiled.  I highly, highly recommend this for anyone, no matter what their interests are.	1999-01-23
not very helpful	I checked this book out from my local library because Dadaism was mentioned in my Design class, and it sounded interesting.  I wanted to learn more about it.  I found this book to be very confusing and not very  informative at all.  It seems that they wrote this so abstract on purpose  (which they may have).  Although the final essay, lecture on dada, was  informative and the essay was, on poetry, was very good.  I'd recommend  this book just for those two lampistries.	1998-12-09
Some good photos, some bad	I guess these were average photos, artistically, photojournalistically they are a bit better.  The introduciton by Stefanie Rosenkranz was poorly done.  (seems she worships the man, who, from her introduction seems to be  either highly arrogant or majorly indifferent)  it's okay at best	1998-11-26
A big drop in quality.	I loved the first Rogue Warrior.  Both of Marcinko's business books were excellent, though one was enough).  Red Cell was pretty good, but after that they began declining in quality.  I mean, there is the obvious formula  to his books (which a commentor below mentions, it's amazing how he can  never parachute out of a plane without something going wrong with his  chute.  I mean, I understand that things go wrong, but every time?  And the  things the character Marcinko does, I mean, there is no way that he would  get away with it that many times.  I respect Marcinko for who he is and  what he has done, but I think he and Weisman need to get together and  change things up for the next installment, or maybe write something  different (i know i'd like to see more nonficiton like Rogue Warrior).	1998-11-26
entertaining, but...	This book was an enjoyable book and entertaining, but it didn't really discuss too much of how the Irish saved civilization.  Sure we learn about the saints and other influences in Irish history, but it didn't live up to  my expectations (of the title).  I do recommend this book, but you need to  pick up something else as well.	1998-11-23
non stop action	this episode in the series was non-stop action.  also, i liked the  humanization of magneto and the ethical dilemma of Xavier (though Golden  didn't develope  it enough)	1998-10-21
a cynical view of education and west texas	well, when i first started this book i was worried, it started out a bit  slow, and the early essays were very academic, BUT the later essays were  full of humor, sarcasm, cynicism, and wisdom.  I know essay collections  don't normally sell well, but this is one that you should definately pick  up.	1998-10-11
a second-rate book	I have to say I was unimpressed with this guide.  the beer and wine  chapters were almost nonexistant.  the backgrounds on the types of liquors  is small and not very informative.  There is no discussion on the different  brands.	1998-10-11
FINALLY!!	it's about time.  I'm a fan of Anderson, and (as I've stated in my review  of the first three books) I know Anderson can write exceptionally well.   Which he wasn't doing for this series until now.  Definately the best of  the series (so far).  Hopefuly this means Anderson has decided to write  this series the way he can not the way he has been.  Highlights:  we learn  more about Tenel Ka, and her relationship with Jacen seems to be  progressing.  Plus a big surprise that happens to her.  Downside:  the last  couple of chapters were lacking.	1998-09-20
a nice conclusion	well, i must say that this trilogy comes to a nice conclusion.  the  problem i've noticed with this trilogy is that the authors did not spend  enough time character development.  This is a great format to dive into the  characters, but the authors didn't seem to take advantage of that.  oh  well, maybe next time.	1998-09-19
another mediocre book	well, i think anderson and moesta are taking a slow turn for the better,  but they still have a long way to go to get to the quality of Anderson's  other books (such as the Jedi academy trilogy).  Zekk is a pale attempt at  a Han Solo if he had turned the wrong way, whereas Jacen is a pale attempt  at Han Solo turned...well, the way he did.  I've noticed that if the empire  was characteristic to the way it normally is (in the adult books), we'd  have seen the death of Lando and Ackbar, and probably quite a few others.   Basically, Anderson tries to write for a younger audience, but he cannot  quite seem to pull it off...he lowers the quality, not the subject matter.	1998-09-16
okay...	I know Anderson is a better writer than this book, and that is taking it  into consideration that this is a book for young adults, but this book was  not up to his usual standards (read the first in the series, and you'll see  he can write a young adult fiction well).  First of all, I cannot believe  that with the twins being kidnapped, Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and Lando (and  remember, he is somewhat responsible) sat back and did nothing.  That  doesn't even fit with their character at all.  I think the idea of the  Shadow Academy is something Anderson should have used for his next  trilogy...there was so much more that could have been done with this idea  that just wasn't.  I am greatly disappointed that ANderson let such a good  story idea fall so flat.	1998-09-15
definately an improvement from the first one	I don't know if it was the addition of castro or what, but the second  edition of this trilogy is most definately better than the first.  The  first read like a comic book (don't get me wrong, i enjoy comics, it's just  that they need pictures).  THis one was more like a novel...I hope to see  an improvement with the third in the series...maybe all the characters (and  not just Bishop and Spider-Man) will become three-dimensional.  Definately  on the right track.	1998-09-15
i've read better	the first part of this trilogy was okay...i mean it was enjoyable, but it  just didn't quite match up to Golden's trilogy...well, i have the other two  books in my room, maybe it'll get better.	1998-09-14
Excellent	This is an excellent horror story.  surprisingly, the movie adaptation was  very accurate of Levin's story.  Though, until the critic below mentioned  it...i didn't notice the prejudices of the book.  might make for an  interesting paper.	1998-09-03
an okay trilogy	(first of all, this review is for the trilogy, and not just _tyrant's  test_) in general this was an average trilogy, nothing spectacular, but not  bad.  there was one excellent point in this trilogy, Chewbacca's part of  the story.  After reading this, Chewbacca seems more human, not so much a  big...wookie...and just Han's sidekick.  It was nice to see someone explore  the character of Chewbacca.  But there were two parts of the story I had  problems with.  One was Luke's part of the story, I mean, how much power  does this guy need?! The other major problem i had with the trilogy is all  the time spent with characters we don't know, don't want to know, and  aren't that important.  I think the author could have spent more time  developing the plot lines of the characters we know (such as Han's capture  or how Leia dealt with it, which really wasn't touched on a whole lot).   But they (other than Lando) didn't seem to have a huge role in the trilogy.   All in all, if you keep up with the star wars universe, this trilogy is  worth the time.	1998-08-26
not exactly your typical medical thriller	I don't know, this wasn't your typical medical thriller, it had a  different...feel.  but it was an excellent book, not quite as good as the  rest of the stuff he has written, but well worth your time and money.	1998-08-26
a fitting end	Memnoch was a fitting end to the chronicles of Lestat.  after the body  theif (which was definately not up to rice's usual standards) and watching  the powerful character of Lestat become a weak, sniveling...Louis I  guess...it was time to end Lestat's reign (i do hope her new vampire books  take up where she left off early in the series, back to the old standards  of writing).  <br />Memnoch was a fascinating character...I hope to see more  of him in the future.  dora was underdeveloped, but roger was well  done.<br />one of the best things about this book was anne's take on religion.   it was excellent, gave me a lot to think about (but i won't spoil it for  those of you who haven't read it).  i think you should pick this book up  just for the theology.	1998-08-15
excellent	shifter is an excellent story, blending both a fantasy world with the real world.  as usual, garfield and judith reeves-stevens have written another captivating tale.	1998-07-26
a must for any business person	marcinko didn't survive through all he did without knowing how to lead and improve.  turns out those same sills that enabled him to war with others have helped him become a success in the business world.  all 10 points in this book not only will help you in the business world, but also in your own life.	1998-07-26
good start	This looks like a good start to another excellent vampire series...she put a lot of work into the historic scene.  It didn't really seem like a vampire story.  I'm waiting to see how the rest of the series goes...	1998-07-12
entertaining and informative	Beer Blast was an incredibly enjoyable book to read and highly informative (if you are a fan of beer).  I will admit that he was a bit focused on Heinekien, but considering his family background.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about beer.	1998-07-07
Informative and Pertaining	Trefil's book does contain 101 of the most fascinating unanswered questions of our time.  This book is an excellent source for grad students looking for a dissertation as well as for the average person just wanting to learn a little more on science.  Admittedly he doesn't go into a lot of detail, but that is part of the books charm, he keeps it short.	1998-07-06
not her best...	an excellent book, but not the best in the series.  Lestat did wine too much and I got a little tired of everyone being able to just toss Lestat around...it just seemed as if the mortals were (at times) more powerful than he was.<br />I did like the part about God and the Devil in the cafe...it made me think.	1998-06-24
this was horrible	This had to have been the worst star wars trilogy I have ever come across.  it took me forever to read because i just couldn't pick it up.  the only reason i even read this trilogy is because of the way all the novels are interconnected, and one day i may need to know what happened.  i don't know what it was, but this was dull.  especially with all the potential the author had to flesh out Han's family and history, but he blew it and just brushed over it.  this was a sad dissapointment.	1998-06-18
romkey's usual	no doubt, this was an excellent book, but I was lead to believe that it was going to be different than the others he's written in the &quot;series&quot; but it wasn't.  Instead of Mozart he had Beethoven (seems to be preoccupied with the composers of the past).  It was still the vampiri Illuminati.  I thought this was going to be different.  Once I realized it wasn't I found the book to be excellent (though I did miss David and Mozart).	1998-06-18
excellent source of information	this book is an excellent source of information on vampires, if for no other reason than the list of novels and films.  for anyone who is interested in vampires, this book is a must.	1998-06-12
excellent	the photographs of keith carter really moved me.  these are some of the best he's taken (though i can think of a few that should have been included).  this book shows the talent carter has (and not just in photography, read his philosophy at the end).  For any lover of art or photography, this book is a definate must have.	1998-06-11
a pretty good piece of work	Carter's first collection is a pretty good collection.  I wasn't overly fond of this work (he has done much better), but there were some pieces that reach out and grab you, plus Carter's skill as an artist makes this book worth buying.	1998-06-11
excellent	the poetry in this collection is very good.  it's thought provoking and brings up an emotional response, which, to me, is what poetry should do. I know include froehlich with my favorite poets.  I look forward to reading more of his work.	1998-06-08
spiritual	I have to recommend this book to everyone.  The plotline behind the story isn't that great, and it is a simply written book, but it is very spiritual and full of the truths of life.  Now that I have read it, in a week or so I will read it again, this time with a highlighter.  This book will be placed on the same shelf as my bible, koran, and other religious and spiritual books.  This book carries within it the simple truths to life.  It can make a difference.  It impacted me greatly, now I hope you read it so that you may be changed as well.	1998-06-03
a celebration of individuality	i'll admit that miss rand's writing style isn't the most captivating, in fact, i'd say she isn't very good.  but it's the philosophy behind the story that makes it so great.  she shows us that even though we need to become one people, we must also remember who we are as an individual.  even if this wasn't such a quick read, i'd recommend it to everyone.	1998-06-01
great art, but the story...	larson has written a book after a bit of an absence.  the art is terrific.  but the story...well, it isn't so good.  i haven't yet decided on what age this book is intended (certainly not for adults).  it is to simple for any half-decently educated adult.  but i think it is a little too much for young children.  maybe he meant this for 10-13 year olds.  the tone of the book is a bit preachy.  hopefully larson's next book will be a bit better.	1998-05-30
frightening	what was truly frightening about this book wasn't the virus (though it is terrifying in itself), but was the infighting and politics and non-cooperation of the army, cdc, and the private company.  if this had been a more dangerous virus, then much damage would have been done.<br />the book itself was decently written, but don't buy it for the writing, but it for the education.	1998-05-26
great re-read	I have probably read this book 10 times, but this time was different.  i'm older and can easier appreciate the social commentary twain made than i could when i was a child.<br />This book is a classic, and if you haven't read it, you should.	1998-05-23
an okay vampire novel	this was a decent story.  it was a little slow in a few place (quite a few), and it seemed that the author preferred dropping names (dr. jeckyll, dr. moreau, jack the ripper, bram stoker) rather than working on plot.  i think the author dragged this story out further than it needed to be.	1998-05-23
excellent advice	Marcinko's book is not only good advice for the business world, but for life as well.  I suggest you purchase this book and follow Marcinko's example.	1998-05-11
disapointing	I read both Starship Troopers and Haldeman's The Forever War, and I enjoyed these books immensely.  Both were social, political, and philisphical commentaries.  And Armour was recommended as a third book to read if I enjoyed these two.  But it wasn't very good.  The parts about Felix (1 &amp; 4 i think) and part 5 were excellent, but we could have done without the Jack Crow story.  It seemed pointless.  I really expected more.  And I have no intention of reading the sequal if he writes it.  What could have been a great book, was turned into another medioce science fiction novel.	1998-05-10
I liked it.	First of all, you must remember that this is fiction.  I've seen many reviewers complain about the technological accuracy or whatever in this book.  Remember:  it is fiction, written by an english teacher.  Keep that in mind and you could enjoy the book.  It has an interesting plot and lots of action.  The sequences in Spain are humorous.  Sure the characters are a little underdeveloped and certain aspects of the plot are ludicrous, but it is an enjoyeable read.  Mind candy.  I just can't believe that nobody has heard of the NSA.  I've known about them since I was a little kid.  My biggest problem with the book is the code at the end, which I can't seem to figure out (I guess cryptology isn't my area).	1998-05-03
a pretty good medical thriller	This story has an interesting concept, the plagues of exodus on a modern day world.  It was pretty well written, but there were a few problems.  Vicky Wade's character seems pointless.  I don't really see her role in the story, and there was so much potential for growth.  Some of the plagues are a bit of a stretch.  Hubbard's character was lacking something.  I didn't like the way the author sold out in the end and set things up for a sequal (the book was good, but not enough for a sequel).  Berger's character wasn't developed.  And finally, you get really tired of ProMED real quick.  But still, it had an interesting idea behind the story, and it had plenty of good points.  check it out.	1998-04-30
Excellent book, but not too believable	This book was an easy read and highly entertaining.  Unfortunately there is no credibility.  The antics that take place here could never happen, the press would go crazy over a candidate with no past, the people seem too gullible, McCann never says anything of substance, and the death of Hammond...well, a reviewer below said it, there is no way he would have been out riding a horse instead of at campaign headquarters.  It gets to be too much, but it still was highly entertaining.	1998-04-27
as good as starship troopers	i enjoyed both this book and starship troopers immensly.  both offered thoughtful commentary on society, and where it may lead.  this book had the time differences which was an excellent addition to the storyline.  at times he threw in too much physics for the layreader, it is one of my problems with the book...not all of us have physics degrees.  also, i think haldeman ended this book a bit too optimistically, but all in all, one of the better books i've read.	1998-04-24
Excellent novel	Romkey's first novel is an excellent one.  The characters are good (though he could have some improvements), interesting plot, and just plain enjoyable.  Though this book is different from his other novels in that it is not a vampire story, but still, excellent job.	1998-04-23
Excellent ending to the trilogy	I must say that this book was excellent, although the first chapter or two starts off a bit slow.  But once again, Salvatore produces an excellent story.  There was one problem with the trilogy, and that was the fact that it was a trilogy.  The third part of this story (the dragon king) could have been written as a trilogy by itself.  It seems Salvatore spent too much time with TSR (or whomever) writting the forgotten realms books, and it would appear that now he thinks everything must be a trilogy.  I wish someone would tell him that there is nothing wrong with writing a series of 4, 5, or 6 books (or even a story that can be told in one book).  I really think he could have lengthened this epic story and increased the pleasure of his fans.  After all, parts of this book flew by with little or no detail.  But all in all, it was an excellent story.	1998-04-19
a pretty good collection	I was rather surprised by this book.  I thought it wasn't going to be that great, anthologies tend not to be, especially after some of the excellent work I've seen done in the Star Wars novels.  Admittedly, some stories were better than others.                                         WE DON'T DO WEDDINGS by Kathy Tyers:  the first story in this anthology was dull, boring, etc. etc.                                                GREEDO'S TALE by Tom Veitch and Martha Veitch:  I'll be the first to admit it was interstesting to learn the background of Greedo, probably one of the most memorable bit characters in the series, he only had a walk-on part and he was dead.  I like the fact that the authors made Greedo out to be a bumbler and not some hot-shot bounty hunter.  It shows that some people (aliens) are just too full of themselves, though what it seemed mostly was that Greedo just wanted some acceptance.                                    HAMMERTONG by Zahn:  well, i didn't like it.         PLAY IT AGAIN by Crispin:  nothing spectacular, but a good story                                     THE HAMMERHAND'S TALE by dave wolverton:  it was nice to learn about the alien who you only get a glimpse of in the  movie (and that's it), but still he is one you don't forget (i think there was even an action figure of him).                   BARTENDER'S TALE by Bischoff:  Excellent story.  And he was a somewhat central character throughout most of the stories.                      NIGHTLILY by Hambly:  It was an okay story, but I really liked how it ended.                          EMPIRE BLUES by Moran: such passiont this Devoronian shows towards music, that I can understand, but still, I think they could have found a more interesting story, but then again...                                                       JAWA'S TALE by Anderson:  I'm surprised, Anderson doesn't usually disapoint me, but he did this time.  I know I don't find the Jawas interesting to begin with, and thestory just didn't grip me.                                                      TRADE WINS by Moesta:  the only point to this story was to flesh out Anderson's.                   THE STORMTROOPER'S TALE by Doug Beason:  This was probably the best story in the collection, in fact I'd like to see more of this character and what he did to help the rebellion.                   SOUP'S ON by Roberson:  by far the worst tale in the collection                                      AT THE CROSSROADS by Jerry Oltion:  I liked this one.  I got a kick out of it.                                                      DOCTOR DEATH by Kenneth Flint:  Another excellent tale.  Once again I got a kick out of the ending                                                      MOISTURE FARMER'S TALE by M. Shayne Bell:  Another excellent story, though I really haven't figure out his connection to the cantina             ONE LAST NIGHT by Garfield and Judith Reeves-Stevens:  Like Anderson, these two rarely disapoint me, but they did here.  I don't know, it felt like a cheesey cop out (like the star trek time travel stories).  One of the worst stories in the collection.                           All in all it was a good anthology and I recommend it.  But you do get tired of reading about Ben's fight in the cantina and Han blasting Greedo.  If you don't mind this repetition (and it is usually only a sentence or two) it's okay.  I did like the wayt the stories all fed off of each other, many thanks to Anderson for that.	1998-04-17
better than the bible?	I found Mailer's book to be uplifting.  I feel he helped personalize Christ without any major changes from what was reported in the Bible.  Mailer helped to humanize the Christ and make him easier to understand and a bit closer to man.	1998-04-13
I couldn't even finish it	I don't know, this book was rambling, dull, boring, etc.  I couldn't even get past chapter three before I had to just put it away.  I just couldn't get into it.  The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it had an interesting idea behind it.  I love vampire books, they are my favorite to read, but trust me, you are better off reading something else.	1998-04-11
Another masterpiece by Wilson	I think this could very well be Wilson's best.  It has an excellent plot with many surprising twists and turns.  Wilson develops all of his characters excellently, even the minor characters.  This book is a definate must read. (I read the original hard cover edition for those wondering).	1998-04-10
excellent	What can I say about this book?  We all already know that almost any book Weis undertakes is going to be excellent.  We all know and love these characters (especially Raul and the Little One) from the previous Mag 7 book and Star of the Guardians.  Since we all know this, why haven't you read this book yet?	1998-04-09
Once again Salvatore shows he is the best fantasy author	I could go on and on about how excellent this book is, but if you are at this page reading this then you probably know how good Salvatore is.  And if you've read the first in this trilogy, well, this one is just as good.  What I especially like about this book is Salvatore's description of the battle scenes (although they were a bit lacking compared to the rest of his work).  I just have no idea how he can be that descriptive in his battle scenes.  Makes you wonder if he was a medival hero in a former life.	1998-04-09
a witty, sarcastic novel	I loved this book.  It was humorous and had a sarcastic edge to the book.  I'll admit, the events that happened to our heroine were pretty unbelievable, but that was part of this books charm.  And for some reason I kept picturing Ellen DeGeneres(spelling?) and that girl from the truth about cats and dogs (you know the voice of daria).  I'll have to see if this one is made into a movie, I think it would be perfect for the big screen.	1998-04-06
i think people miss the point...	I think that this is one of the best books I've ever read (and I don't give out 10s that easily).  But from reading the reviews below, I think people are missing something.  Holden is a very troubled boy.  I think it is rather obvious that he has some psychological disorders (depression for one, maybe a few others).  And as someone who has experienced a few of those breakdowns, I can tell you that a lot of what Holden feels is a lot of what I felt.  Sure there is teen angst involved in this story, and I'm sure it is an excellent social commentary, but what strikes me most about Salinger's story is how accurately it portrays the thoughts of a person with depression.  If you really want to understand how a person with depression or anti-socail tendencies feels, read this book.	1998-04-06
a decent wilson novel	This was an excellent novel by wilson, but after reading Nightwatcher and The Silent Witness, I know he is capable of better.  I knew from page 66 on who was behind the killing of Robert.  Although Wilson did come in with a big shocker at the end.  Other than that, it was fairly predictable.	1998-04-06
I understand why it is a classic	While I wasn't overly fond of the story (it was disjointed, had no plot, character development, or timeline) I really liked this book because of the political and philosophical statment made.  I highly recommend this book.	1998-04-05
Miller is what does it	I've noticed that the two books miller co-wrote are better than the rest of the series.  Perhaps Leigh should have stepped off of this project and allowed miller to take over.  (Kind of makes me wonder why Leigh brought him in to begin with)	1998-04-05
Shocking	What was shocking about this book wasn't anything in the plot (it was all rather predictable), but rather that Leigh actually wrote a decent book (who knows, maybe he is a decent writer, but you can't tell by this series).  Kind of makes me wonder why he couldn't produce anything better earlier in the series.	1998-04-05
a satisfying book	Another good book in the star wars saga.  What I especially like about the X-Wing series is that it focuses more around Wedge than Luke, Han, Leia, etc. which most of the other star wars novels don't do.  I did feel that there should have been more time spent in the X-Wings battling, I'm sure the Rebellion has people better trained for that kind of operation than a bunch of fighter pilots.	1998-04-05
One of the best books I've read	I would have to rate this book as one of the best books I've come across.  Outside of the entertainment value (excellent character development, good plot) it was an excellent source for philosophy, politics, and sociology.  This novel made you think.  In some ways Heinlein's future world is better off than our own (though there are some rather obvious flaws).  This book is so thought provoking.  It'd make an excellent subject for discussion in any philosophy, political science, sociology, or anthropology course.  This book not only set out to entertain, but to make the reader think.  And that is what makes this book one of the best I've ever read, it did both.	1998-04-05
a new low	This was the worst book in the series.  Why you ask?  Because it was boring.  Dull.  I just couldn't get into it.  Everything about it was boring.  In fact the only reason I'm even going to read the last two books in the series is because of the time I've invested this far.  (and I never did see the Spanish conquistadors mentioned on the back cover)	1998-03-26
the series is improving	Well, after the third book i can rate the book one higher.  Maybe it was John Miller or maybe I'm just getting into the character, or maybe i've invested so much time i'm curious as to how the story will end.  I think the reason I like this book better was the samurai world.  Leigh never makes the mutata or the gairk understandable to the reader, at least with the samuria, we alreardy have an idea what they are like.  I hope the last three books in the series Leigh spends time making the mutata understandable.	1998-03-24
As good as the Dark Elf series	I highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of fantasy.  Salvatore is a master in the genre.  The book is loaded with action and humor (especially from Oliver).  Luthien is a character that I could see becoming as popular as Salvatore's Dark Elf, Drizzt.  For anyone who enjoyed Salvatore's Dark Elf sereis, this book is a definate must.	1998-03-16
slightly better than the first	I'll admit this book is better than the first, but it is still only an average book.  The two qualities that stick out in my mind is the further development of Peter.  Watching the path he is taking, well it is disturbing to see.  The other gem in this book is Bradbury's short story, &quot;The Sound of Thunder&quot; which is the story that started this series.  And believe me, after reading Bradbury at the end, you realize just how 'average' Stephen Leigh is.  But it has made me curious enough to read the next book in the series.  I'll let you know how that one turns out.	1998-03-13
Great idea!!!	This book has an excellent idea behind it (what do you expect, it comes from a Ray Bradbury short story) and the world created is very interesting.  But, it seems kind of juvenile.  The language and culture of the Mutata seemed to have taken little thought.  Peter and Eckles aren't developed at all, for that matter neither is Travis.  The very idea of Mundo's world (and Mundo himself) is ludicrous.  But I saw hope for the series (just 6 books).  Towards the end of the story the writing picked up.  I saw a lot of room for improvement, but it got better.  So, I'll try the next book in the series and see how it goes.  Perhaps all six are worth reading, maybe I won't finish the next.  It all depends on where Stephen Leigh takes the story.	1998-03-12
wilson has truly gripped the suspense novel	I feel that Wilson has a good grasp on what it takes to write a successful mystery/suspense novel.  The main characters are well developed  (like Ray, Ramsey, and Leigh Ann). The plot has more twists and turns and surprises than I think I have ever seen in so short a novel.  (One might say he has too many twists, but I would disagree, I hate a predictable book).  The only fault I find with this novel is the underdevelopment of the minor characters such as Red, the Lutter boy, the Julie's parents.  I hope Wilson keeps turning out books with the quality of this and Nightwatcher.	1998-03-10
a surprising letdown	I am a huge fan of the X-title comic books (or at least when I can afford to buy them) and I usually find them wonderful to read.  I am also a fan of the comic books that have been written as novels (I've read the death of superman, a couple of spiderman books, and golden's first book in his x-man trilogy) and I've found most of them to be excellent.  Especially the X-titles.  But this book just didn't have it.  The characters were never developed (they spent most of the time moping around), the plot was weak.  The drawings were good though.  There just didn't seem to be a purpose to this story.  I know the authors can do better work, and I hope to see them do better in the future.  This book makes me want to only read a comic-book-turned-novel if it has Chistopher Golden's name afterwards. But, if they write another X-book, I'll give them another try.  I see room for potential.	1998-03-08
interesting delimma	This isn't normally the kind of book I read (it being a mystery), but I'm glad I did, because it really wasn't a mystery.  More of a suspense or cop story.  I like the interesting moral dilemma this book poses..would you pay a half million dollars in ransom for a child that is not your own?  And what if paying this ransom ruins you?  What would you do?  I think McBain could have spent more time on this aspect of the novel.  Also, this book contains some of the best dialogues I've seen.  I could picture a couple of good actors acting this out on the big screen.  The biggest problem i found with the book was McBain wrote it 'soft.'  I would've expected more swearing and adult content from kidnappers, but all in all this book is a must.	1998-03-08
my first x-files book	As much as I like Anderson, I felt something was missing from this book, it isn't up to the quality he normally writes, nor was it up to the quality of the show.  I cannot quite place my finger on what was missing, maybe it was the 'explanation' that didn't sit well, but Anderson did redeem himself with a fast pace, excellent ending.	1998-03-05
excellent format	There were many things about this book I enjoyed.  The email format of the novel was an excellent idea.  You get to watch Edgar grow as the story (email messages) go on.  Teller raises some interesting questions about the ethics of AI if they ever reach their goal of a &quot;human&quot; computer.  I also liked the way Teller made both Edgar and Alice have their breakdowns together.  The only problem a reader might have the boo is that it is just email messages.  If your mind isn't open to the philosophies of AI you may not find this book interesting	1998-03-04
another excellent stars wars book	After so many let downs in the star wars saga, I must say it was nice to see a well-written piece of the story appear (outside of anderson and hambly no one else seems to be able to do much of anything good with star wars).  The only problem i have with this novel, and the only reason I gave it an 8 was the fact that zahn puts no suspense in the mind fo the reader with the re-emergence of thrawn.  he should've held off on that information til the end of the second book.	1998-02-25
nice edition to the saga	I've noticed that this book seems to have recieved a lot of 8's in ratings.  That's because even though this book is very good, it is lacking in a few areas.  I must agree with the reader below that there are more interesting things that could have been done with Callista than just have her fade away.  I felt cheated (unless they have something spectacular for her in a future novel and I don't believe Luke and Callista should get together, just something that could help the character of Skywalker grow).  It was a nice touch to see Leia struggle with her heritage.  The droids adventure was good.  The two areas where this booked lacked was in Han, Lando, and Chewie part of the story.  I felt it was weak, and the only reason it was there was to include these characters in the novel.  The other weak area was the ending, the 'mysterious life-form.'  It was weak.  As was the character of Dzym.  And the Hutt could have been further developed, it was interesting to see a Hutt with Jedi skills.  And what about Taselda?  Did she have a point to the story, because her character certainly wasn't developed.  I think Hambly should have spent a little more time and a few more pages to develope this story the way it should have been.  But overall, I'd say this is a good novel, and an excellent addition to the saga.	1998-02-19
a classic in the making	Once again King has proven why he is the top selling author of this time (or any time).  I beleive that the Dark Tower Series will be hailed as a classic a few years down the road.  It contains two of my favorite genres, horror and apocalyptic fiction, it's an epic fantasy, a western, and now King has written his first &quot;romance novel.&quot;  I think that before this ends, King will have included every genre possible in this series.  What I like is how he draws his other books into this series as well.  I've read some complaints down further about the flashback.  I felt it was a beautiful story and helped to explain why Roland is the way he is.  People also complain because they don't know what happened to Sheemie, Alain, or Cuthbert, well, it looked to me that Roland was going to explain it later in the series.  As I'm sure Rhea will.  Another complaint I've read is the Wizard of Oz ending.  Why wouldn't one of the greatest sagas include a little bit of our classic quest?  This series is one of my favorite King novels (along with the Stand and Salem's Lot).  You don't even have to be a King fan to enjoy this series.  Now, go buy the book.	1998-02-07
excellent	I found this book to be a great read.  I picked it up because it was written by one of my favorite authors (and I got lucky with it being a vampire novel).  I like the different slant he took on vampires.	1998-01-25
pretty good for a children's author	All in all this is a pretty good book.  I mean you don't become one of the most bestselling children's authors if you have no talent.  And there is no doubt Stine can write, especially young adult fiction.  But stepping into the world of adult fiction is a little different.  Stine added lots of profanity, gore, and sex.  That seems to be all that separates this from his earlier work.  That and a few hundred extra pages.  I got the impression that Stine deliberately extended this story to almost 400 pages because he felt that would make it more adult like.  Unfortunately the story wasn't a 400 page story.  Stine would have done better to cut out the uneeded parts and tell the story the way it needed to be told.  I think he would have done better to write this the way he normally does, for young adults.  But it was pretty decent (not comparable to King, Koontz, or Barker, but who is) and it was his first shot at an adult novel.  I would recommend this, and I would pick up the next adult novel he writes because with experience, i think he'll learn the craft of writing for adults.	1998-01-19
jaws in a river	Surprisingly this was a good book (read my review of direct descendant).  I wasn't sure if Wilson had it in him (i wasn't very fond of the only other book of his i read).  But this was kind of you typical shark novel, except it was in a river.  my recommendation is to read this book	1998-01-12
Not a normal Koontz novel...	What can I say?  Koontz is normally one of my favorite authors, but this book...just wasn't up to par, even after the rewrite.  In fact I feel the only reason he rewrote it was to through in some current names (such as Winona Ryder and Deep Blue) and to mention the internet.  The plot was weak, but not as weak as the characters.  The computer (who told the story) just babbled.  I could cut half the words out of the novel and still not lose the story.  The other two characters in the story were not developed.  I could tell that this was one of Koontz's early works, I'm just surprised it got published (twice).  The only plus this story had were the themes of male attitude towards women.  Now this would make a good book to analyze for an english class, but not a whole lot of enjoyment.	1998-01-10
good for a few chuckles	This was an enjoyeable book.  It gets kind of weary at times and some of the jokes have worn thin, but over all, it is good for a few laughs	1998-01-08
Crichton on a bad day	Wilson's book has a superb idea, which is why I bought the book.  He starts off well, but as the plot moves on...he begins to lose it.  The plot gets worse and worse as the story moves on.  He starts off with an excellent idea, but he just cannot seem to clinch it.  What starts off as a Crichton type novel finishes with a weak alien sub-plot.  Like I said, great idea, but Wilson just cannot seem to pull it off.  Better luck next time (or at least I hope so, because I purchased Extinct and Fertile Ground at the same time).  If you want to read this novel, check it out, it isn't quite worth the money, purchase a Crichton novel instead, and head to your public library for this one.	1998-01-08
Pretty good for a copy	I would say this is one of the better of Saul's books I have read (but by all means have I read all of his books, only about half of them).  It was an interesting story idea.  Unfortunately I couldn't help but compare it to the Green Mile, and we all know that you just cannot compare Saul with King.  He doesn't even come close.  In fact, reading this series made me think of what King said in Danse Macabre (if you don't know buy the book and use the index).  All in all this is a pretty decent book(s), but it just seemed to me a cheap marketing strategy to sell more books.  I didn't see why he felt he had to write this story in the way he did.  Just copying the master I guess.	1998-01-06
excellent	i don't know what it is about this book, but i love it.  i've read it several times, and still enjoy it	1997-06-14
